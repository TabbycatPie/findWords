1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:06,238
- MY NAME IS BARRY ALLEN,
AND I AM THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE.

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:08,141
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
I SAW MY MOTHER KILLED

3
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:09,141
BY SOMETHING IMPOSSIBLE.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,443
- RUN, BARRY.
RUN.

5
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:13,278
- MY FATHER WENT TO PRISON
FOR HER MURDER.

6
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:17,250
THEN AN ACCIDENT
MADE ME THE IMPOSSIBLE.

7
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,786
TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD, I'M
AN ORDINARY FORENSICS SCIENTIST,

8
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:21,788
BUT SECRETLY, I USE MY SPEED

9
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,557
TO FIGHT CRIME
AND FIND OTHERS LIKE ME.

10
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,826
AND ONE DAY, I'LL FIND
WHO KILLED MY MOTHER.

11
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:29,495
- MOM.
- AND GET JUSTICE FOR MY FATHER.

12
00:00:29,527 --> 00:00:31,363
I AM THE FLASH.

13
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:34,167
PREVIOUSLY, ON<i> THE FLASH--</i>

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,768
- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

15
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:38,438
- THIS IS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT,
USING MY SPEED TO DO GOOD.

16
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,273
- WE TALKED ABOUT YOU HELPING
US CONTAIN OTHER META-HUMANS.

17
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,542
- AFTER ALL OF THESE JOURNALISM
CLASSES, I STARTED A BLOG.

18
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:44,643
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE TAKING
JOURNALISM,

19
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:46,179
NOT SCIENCE FICTION WRITING.

20
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,447
- EVER SINCE I HAVE KNOWN YOU,

21
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,281
YOU HAVE BELIEVED
IN THE IMPOSSIBLE.

22
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:51,116
WHAT IF YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT
THE NIGHT THAT YOUR MOM DIED?

23
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,585
SOMETHING OUT THERE
IS SAVING PEOPLE.

24
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,625
- SEE YOU SOON, BARRY.

25
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,628
- HOW OFTEN DO YOU THINK ABOUT

26
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:04,430
WHY YOUR FRIENDS CAME
INTO YOUR LIFE?

27
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:08,433
WAS IT RANDOM, BY DESIGN,
OR MAYBE A LITTLE OF BOTH?

28
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:11,203
- NICE.

29
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:14,439
- REGARDLESS OF THE REASON,
SOME FRIENDS YOU JUST KNOW

30
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:17,442
ARE GONNA BE BY YOUR SIDE
FOR A WHILE.

31
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:20,646
OTHERS, YOU'RE NOT SO SURE.

32
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:24,484
AND THEN THERE'S THAT ONE
FRIEND WHO, WELL, YOU HOPE,

33
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:28,487
SOMEDAY BECOMES SOMETHING MORE.

34
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,456
BUT "FRIEND"
WILL HAVE TO DO FOR NOW.

35
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:33,558
AND THAT'S OKAY.

36
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:35,460
I GUESS.

37
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:37,730
- I'M GLAD
YOU INVITED CAITLIN AND CISCO.

38
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:38,831
- THEY'RE COOL, RIGHT?

39
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:40,600
- THEY SAVED YOUR LIFE, BARRY.

40
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:42,734
THAT MAKES THEM THE COOLEST
PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET.

41
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:45,438
IT'S NICE
THAT YOU GUYS BECAME FRIENDS.

42
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:49,843
TO FRIENDS, OLD AND NEW.

43
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,448
OOH.
I'M UP.

44
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,351
WISH ME LUCK.

45
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,154
I'M GOING TO DESTROY YOU.

46
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:03,122
- DON'T GET COCKY, WEST.

47
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:10,429
- GUYS?
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

48
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:13,365
- WE ALL DO WHEN GUYS
LIKE HIM EXIST.

49
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,901
- YEAH, HE'S SO HOT.

50
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,570
UH, I MEAN,
GENETICALLY SPEAKING.

51
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:20,439
BECAUSE I'M A GENETICIST,
OF COURSE.

52
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:21,774
OH, MY GOD,
DO I SOUND LIKE FELICITY?

53
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:23,408
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT EDDIE.

54
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:27,647
I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS.

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,515
I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING.

56
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:32,784
- YEAH, THAT'S USUALLY WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU DRINK TOO MUCH.

57
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,954
- NO, THE ALCOHOL
IS NOT AFFECTING ME.

58
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:37,355
I MEAN I LITERALLY FEEL NOTHING.

59
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,525
- IT'S YOUR HYPERMETABOLISM.
I NEED A SAMPLE.

60
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:40,692
- I'LL GET MORE SHOTS.

61
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:42,662
- I SWEAR,
I HAD A VACUTAINER HERE.

62
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:44,563
- WAIT, YOU CARRY A BLOOD
COLLECTION KIT IN YOUR PURSE?

63
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,533
- YOU HAVE YOUR HOBBIES.

64
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,278
- 14TH FLOOR IS SECURE.
- ROGER THAT.

65
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:03,316
- [whistling]

66
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:09,521
HOLD OFF ON THAT CHECK.

67
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:18,496
LOCK DOWN THE BUILDING!

68
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,967
HOLD IT!

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,367
- DON'T COME NEAR ME.

70
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:26,739
- YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME.
COME ON.

71
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:28,441
- GET DOWN!

72
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:33,278
[loud blast]

73
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:48,894
- STILL NOTHING?
- I CAN'T GET DRUNK.

74
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:50,462
I MEAN, I'M ONLY 25,

75
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,731
AND MY DRINKING DAYS
ARE ALREADY OVER.

76
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,999
- COME ON, ALLEN.
YOU'RE UP.

77
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,335
[cell phone sounds]

78
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,603
THERE WAS A BOMBING
ON 8TH AND PASS.

79
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,573
I GOT TO GO, BABE.
- OKAY.

80
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:02,441
- SORRY, GUYS.

81
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:04,409
- I'VE GOT AN EARLY SHIFT
AT JITTERS.

82
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,344
BARRY, WE'LL CATCH UP TOMORROW.

83
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:08,947
- IT'S GETTING LATE, ANYWAY,
SO I'M JUST GONNA...

84
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,556
- HELP! HELP!

85
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,492
SOMEBODY!

86
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,895
- GUYS, THERE'S A WINDOW WASHER,
AND HE'S GONNA FALL.

87
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:24,029
- DON'T TRY AND CATCH HIM.

88
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:25,664
YOU DON'T HAVE SUPER STRENGTH.

89
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:27,399
- WELL, IS THERE,
LIKE, A BED STORE NEAR HERE?

90
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:29,367
WHAT IF I GET A BUNCH
OF MATTRESSES AND STACK THEM?

91
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:31,670
- BARRY,
THIS ISN'T A ROADRUNNER CARTOON.

92
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,506
- HELP! HELP!

93
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:36,074
- HOW FAST WOULD I NEED TO GO TO
RUN UP THE SIDE OF A BUILDING?

94
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,677
- HOW FAR UP DO YOU NEED TO GO?

95
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,913
- HURRY, SOMEBODY!

96
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,949
- I DON'T KNOW.
50 METERS, GIVE OR TAKE.

97
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:46,552
- 32.56...
[murmuring]

98
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:51,624
- GUYS, HURRY!
- HELP!

99
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:53,558
- JUST RUN REALLY FAST
AND YOU'LL BE FINE.

100
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:56,562
BUT YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN YOUR
VELOCITY ON THE WAY DOWN, OR--

101
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:58,798
- OR WHAT?

102
00:04:58,831 --> 00:04:59,932
- SPLAT.

103
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:01,766
- GREAT.
- HELP!

104
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,937
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

105
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:09,007
HERE GOES.

106
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:48,613
- BARRY?
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

107
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:52,485
- BOMBERS TYPICALLY HAVE
THEIR OWN UNIQUE SIGNATURES.

108
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:54,619
CRIMPED WIRES, FRAGMENTATION.

109
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:57,857
THE LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION IS
TELLING ONCE I'VE ANALYZED IT.

110
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,459
YOU SHOW ME A BOMB,
I CAN USUALLY FIND A CLUE IN IT.

111
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:02,027
- IT SOUNDS LIKE
THERE'S A "BUT" COMING.

112
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,663
- YEAH, I HAVEN'T FOUND ANY SIGN
OF AN OXIDIZING AGENT.

113
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,599
IT'S AS IF THE FLOOR
JUST BLEW ITSELF UP.

114
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,100
- THINGS DON'T JUST BLOW UP.

115
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:11,704
- SECURITY GUARD SAID OUR BOMBER
WAS A WOMAN, RED HAIR.

116
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:13,639
MUST'VE CUT
THE SECURITY CAMERA'S FEED.

117
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:16,709
THERE'S NO FOOTAGE, BUT
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE.

118
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:20,879
SOME KIND OF SMALL CHARGE
BLASTED THE DOORKNOB OFF.

119
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,182
- ANY IDEA WHAT'S MISSING?

120
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:24,983
- MY GUESS IS ONE
OF THESE FILES.

121
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:27,153
IT'S GONNA TAKE DAYS
TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE.

122
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:31,890
- LET'S LET BARRY DO HIS THING.

123
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,118
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

124
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,187
BUT THEY CAME IN HERE
LIKE THEY OWN THE PLACE.

125
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,223
BEEN TALKING TO SINGH
FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR.

126
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:06,057
- THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

127
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:14,066
- GENERAL EILING,
THIS IS DETECTIVE WEST.

128
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:16,901
- DETECTIVE.

129
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,637
- WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

130
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,574
- THE ARMY'S TAKING OVER
THE BOMBING INVESTIGATION.

131
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,142
- I'LL NEED EVERYTHING YOU HAVE.

132
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:25,076
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE,
PHOTOGRAPHS, WITNESS INTERVIEWS,

133
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,579
AND ALL YOUR PERSONAL NOTES.

134
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,180
- I'VE BEEN ON THE JOB
NEARLY 20 YEARS

135
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:30,483
AND NEVER HEARD OF THE ARMY
INVESTIGATING ANYTHING CIVILIAN.

136
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:35,020
- WELL, IT'S NOT CIVILIAN.
SHE'S ONE OF OURS.

137
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:36,721
- WE'LL SEND OVER
EVERYTHING WE GOT.

138
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:38,591
- VERY KIND OF YOU.

139
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,595
I THINK WE'LL TAKE IT NOW,
THOUGH.

140
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:46,098
- GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT, JOE.

141
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,568
- YOU HEARD HIM, JOE.
GIVE ME WHAT I WANT.

142
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:02,114
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

143
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:04,983
- GENERAL EILING IS RELIEVING US
FROM THE BOMBING CASE.

144
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:09,555
GIVE THESE MEN EVERYTHING
THAT'S RELEVANT.

145
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:11,123
- SURE THING, YEAH.

146
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:19,764
- YOU AND A FEW CIVILIANS
FROM S.T.A.R. LABS

147
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,901
MIGHT WANT TO CHECK INTO THAT.

148
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,701
- I THINK WE MIGHT.

149
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:25,971
- CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR
A MINUTE, JOE?

150
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,640
IT'S ABOUT IRIS.

151
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:30,808
- HEY, DAD.
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

152
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:33,778
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING
AT THE BOMB SITE LAST NIGHT?

153
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:37,649
DON'T DENY YOU WERE THERE.
OFFICER VUKUVICH SAW YOU.

154
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:39,884
- IT'S...COMPLICATED.

155
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:41,820
- YOU CAN'T BE COMING
TO EVERY CRIME SCENE

156
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:42,887
BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT EDDIE.

157
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,156
HE'S A BIG BOY, IRIS.

158
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:45,823
- I DIDN'T GO THERE
TO SEE EDDIE.

159
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:49,194
I WENT THERE TO SEE THE STREAK.

160
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:57,201
- THE STREAK.
HMM, WHY IS THAT?

161
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:58,704
- MY BLOG.

162
00:08:58,736 --> 00:09:00,171
I'VE BEEN COLLECTING
INTERNET POSTS

163
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:04,710
ABOUT THE STREAK SIGHTINGS,
AND WRITING ABOUT THEM.

164
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,278
- BABY, THERE'S NO STREAK.

165
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:07,947
- YES, THERE IS.

166
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,182
I SAW HIM LAST NIGHT, DAD.
I LOOKED RIGHT AT HIM.

167
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,818
SOMETHING INCREDIBLE
IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL CITY.

168
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:15,321
AND I AM GONNA WRITE ABOUT IT.

169
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,288
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO GET TO WORK.

170
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:22,861
BLOGGING ABOUT SUPERNATURAL
EVENTS DOESN'T REALLY PAY WELL.

171
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:31,302
- A VA FILE NUMBER IS ALL
THE INFO YOU HAVE ON THE BOMBER?

172
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:33,238
- CCPD'S BEEN ORDERED
OFF THE CASE.

173
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,806
- WELL, WHO HAS THE POWER
TO DO THAT?

174
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,343
- THE ARMY.
SOME GENERAL.

175
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,345
HIS NAME WAS EILING, I THINK.

176
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,213
- GENERAL WADE EILING.

177
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,381
- YOU KNOW HIM?
- YEAH, I KNOW HIM.

178
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:45,317
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO,
GENERAL WADE EILING

179
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,052
CONTRACTED S.T.A.R. LABS
TO DEVELOP

180
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:49,088
ENHANCED GENE THERAPIES
FOR SOLDIERS.

181
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,221
I WAS INTERESTED
IN THE POTENTIAL

182
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:52,091
MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR CIVILIANS.

183
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,225
GENERAL EILING REALLY WANTED
TO DEVELOP

184
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:57,830
MIND READING CAPABILITIES
FOR INTERROGATION PURPOSES.

185
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,898
I STOPPED THE STUDY WHEN I
SAW HIS TECHNIQUES UP CLOSE,

186
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:02,368
BUT OUR SPLIT
WAS LESS THAN AMICABLE.

187
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,870
- HE TOOK ALL THE EVIDENCE
I COLLECTED ON THE BOMBING.

188
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:07,005
EVERYTHING BUT THE FOLDER.

189
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:09,875
- WELL...LUCKY FOR US,
THE VA FINALLY

190
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:13,379
JOINED THE NEW MILLENNIUM
AND DIGITIZED THEIR RECORDS.

191
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,047
A LOT OF REDACTED INFO.

192
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,716
BUT OUR GIRL'S NAME
IS BETTE SANS SOUCI,

193
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:19,718
AN EOD SPECIALIST FOR THE ARMY.

194
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,386
- EOD?
- BOMBS.

195
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:22,687
- IS THERE AN ADDRESS?

196
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:23,889
- HOLD ON.
HERE, WE GO.

197
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,990
ONE PERSON IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.

198
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:28,961
CAMERON SCOTT.
INGLEWOOD.

199
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:52,016
- BETTE SANS SOUCI?

200
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:53,017
I NEED YOU TO COME WITH ME.

201
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:56,288
- DON'T TOUCH ME.

202
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:58,024
GET WHATEVER YOU'RE WEARING
OFF OF YOU.

203
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:01,126
HURRY.

204
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,908
- BARRY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
BARRY?

205
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,777
- THERE MUST BE A PERFECTLY
REASONABLE EXPLANATION

206
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,945
FOR WHY HE'S NOT ANSWERING.

207
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:24,383
BARRY?

208
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,784
UH--

209
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:28,187
- DON'T ASK.

210
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,190
- I'M GONNA ASK.
WHERE'S MY SUIT?

211
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:34,759
- IT'S...GONE.

212
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,227
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT'S GONE?

213
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,762
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH MY SUIT?

214
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:39,298
- IT BLEW UP, DUDE.

215
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,467
I MANAGED TO GET OUT OF IT
BEFORE IT WENT, "KABOOM."

216
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,069
- MY SUIT WENT "KABOOM"?

217
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:46,971
- FUN FACT ABOUT
BETTE SANS SOUCI.

218
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:48,240
SHE'S NOT CARRYING BOMBS.

219
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:49,841
SHE TOUCHED THE EMBLEM
ON THE SUIT

220
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,211
AND TURNED IT INTO A BOMB.

221
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,846
SHE'S A META-HUMAN.

222
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,081
- WITH THE ABILITY
TO CAUSE SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION

223
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:58,484
UPON TACTILE CONTACT.

224
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,819
- SHE BLEW UP MY SUIT.
- YOU HAVE, LIKE, THREE MORE.

225
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:03,521
- OKAY, I HAVE TWO.
AND I LOVED THAT ONE.

226
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:05,223
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT HER?

227
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,992
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S PURE EVIL.

228
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:09,360
WE'RE GONNA FIND THIS GIRL

229
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:11,964
AND SEND HER BUTT
INTO THE PIPELINE.

230
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:13,498
NO ONE BLOWS MY TECH
TO SMITHEREENS

231
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:17,102
AND GETS AWAY WITH IT...

232
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:21,038
UNLESS SHE LOOKS LIKE THAT.

233
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:22,774
- I DON'T THINK
SHE MEANT TO HURT ME.

234
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:24,143
- WELL, HER BEING A META-HUMAN

235
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,112
EXPLAINS GENERAL EILING'S
INTEREST IN HER.

236
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:29,548
- AND WHY HE STOLE THE CASE
FROM US.

237
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:33,985
HE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW WHAT SHE COULD DO.

238
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,287
- DETECTIVE.
- DOCTOR.

239
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,357
SO...HUMAN BOMB.

240
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:39,991
MUST BE TUESDAY IN CENTRAL CITY.

241
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,959
- YES, AND GENERAL EILING'S

242
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:45,097
NOT ONE TO GIVE UP A POTENTIAL
ASSET WITHOUT A FIGHT.

243
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,899
- WE HAVE TO FIND HER
BEFORE HE DOES.

244
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,802
- BARRY?
CAN I SEE YOU FOR A SECOND?

245
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:57,308
WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING
ON TELLING ME

246
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,043
THAT IRIS SAW THE STREAK?

247
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:01,179
- THAT WAS NOT PLANNED.
SHE CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD.

248
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:03,081
- WE HAD A DEAL.

249
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:04,850
YOU KEEP HER IN THE DARK
ABOUT THE META-HUMANS,

250
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:07,019
AND I DON'T GO FLOYD MAYWEATHER
ON YOU.

251
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,253
- OKAY, JOE, I KNOW.

252
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:10,154
- AND SHE'S WRITING A BLOG NOW.

253
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:11,490
- I ALREADY TALKED TO HER
ABOUT THAT.

254
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:14,826
- TALK TO HER AGAIN.
AND BE MORE CONVINCING.

255
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,431
- OKAY.

256
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,166
YOU MEAN, RIGHT NOW?
- YES, I DO.

257
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:23,234
- ALL RIGHT.

258
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:25,571
YOU'VE GOT
TO STOP WRITING ABOUT THIS GUY.

259
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,573
HE DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.
- I SAW HIM, BARRY.

260
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:30,042
HE WEARS A RED SUIT,
LIKE, A UNIFORM OR SOMETHING,

261
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,578
WITH A LIGHTING BOLT
ON HIS CHEST.

262
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,078
- I MEAN, IRIS, COME ON.

263
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:36,314
YOU WERE DRINKING LAST NIGHT
AT THE BAR.

264
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:38,950
- I WAS NOT DRUNK,
AND I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

265
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,918
HE WEARS A MASK.

266
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:44,456
I THINK HE SMILED AT ME.

267
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:47,192
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
IF HE IS WEARING A MASK,

268
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,327
THAT PROBABLY MEANS HE DOESN'T
WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHO HE IS.

269
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,163
- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO HE IS.

270
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:54,966
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT PEOPLE
KNOW THAT HE'S OUT THERE.

271
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,068
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

272
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:59,605
WHY CAN'T YOU BE MORE
SUPPORTIVE?

273
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:03,041
- I'M JUST--YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
PUT YOUR NAME ON IT.

274
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:07,278
HOW SERIOUS CAN YOU BE
ABOUT AN ANONYMOUS BLOG?

275
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,115
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
OUR ENTIRE LIVES,

276
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,652
YOU COULDN'T SCREAM LOUD ENOUGH
THAT THE IMPOSSIBLE EXISTED.

277
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:16,254
AND NOW IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING
IN CENTRAL CITY.

278
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,557
I HAVE PROOF OF IT, AND YOU
DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT?

279
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:21,960
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, BARRY.

280
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:23,495
SO WHEN YOU'RE READY TO TELL ME
WHAT THIS WHOLE ROUTINE

281
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:27,132
IS REALLY ABOUT, THEN WE CAN
TALK.

282
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:31,970
[cell phone vibrates]
- YEAH.

283
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:33,972
- WE'VE PIGGYBACKED ONTO GENERAL
EILING'S OWN SURVEILLANCE.

284
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:35,539
ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY'RE
SAYING,

285
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:39,177
THE LOVELY MS. SANS SOUCI
WAS JUST SPOTTED IN INGLEWOOD.

286
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,047
- THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD
AS DR. HAROLD HADLEY'S OFFICE,

287
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,282
THE MILITARY SURGEON
WHO PERFORMED

288
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,683
SEVERAL PROCEDURES ON HER.

289
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,317
THAT'S WHY SHE WAS LOOKING
FOR THE FOLDER.

290
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,519
- YOU GOT TO GET TO HER
BEFORE EILING DOES.

291
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:49,889
- OKAY.

292
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:06,938
- SGT. SANS SOUCI.
- YOU REMEMBER ME.

293
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:10,475
GOOD.
BECAUSE I REMEMBER YOU, DOCTOR.

294
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,311
I REMEMBER WAKING UP
FROM A COMA.

295
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,979
YOU STARTED CUTTING ME OPEN.

296
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:16,681
- I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO HELP EASE YOUR CONDITION.

297
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,182
YOU COULDN'T CONTROL IT.

298
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:21,687
- YOU DID THIS TO ME.
YOU AND EILING.

299
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,273
- GO BRING ME MY ASSET.

300
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:48,713
- YOU OKAY?

301
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,381
LOOK, I CAN GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

302
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:51,716
I CAN HELP YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

303
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,186
- HOW?
- BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO ME TOO.

304
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,021
PLEASE.

305
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:12,638
- TARGET IS GONE.

306
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,246
- AS THE DETONATION DISPERSED
THROUGHOUT CENTRAL CITY,

307
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,115
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE EXPOSED
TO A WAVE

308
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,417
OF UNQUANTIFIABLE ENERGY.

309
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,253
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE...WAS YOU.

310
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:31,155
YOU WERE IN CENTRAL CITY
TEN MONTHS AGO.

311
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,659
- I HAD JUST RETURNED
FROM AFGHANISTAN.

312
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,228
I WAS THERE
DEFUSING ROADSIDE BOMBS

313
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:41,766
AND...SHRAPNEL RIPPED
THROUGH ME.

314
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,267
I WAS FLOWN BACK STATE SIDE.

315
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:44,770
SPENT MONTHS
AT THE BASE RECUPERATING

316
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:48,407
AND NEXT THING I KNOW,

317
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,143
I BECAME THE THING THAT ALMOST
KILLED ME.

318
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,413
AND EILING'S FAVORITE,
NEW LAB RAT.

319
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,814
- THE DARK MATTER MUST HAVE
COMBINED

320
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:59,250
WITH THE BOMB PARTICULATE
INSIDE YOUR BODY.

321
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:01,787
- I THOUGHT EILING
DID THIS TO ME.

322
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,758
- EILING IS NOT SMART ENOUGH
TO CREATE SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

323
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,126
CLEVER ENOUGH TO SEE YOUR VALUE.

324
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,064
- DO YOU KNOW OF ANY OTHERS
WHO WERE CHANGED?

325
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:13,464
- THERE'VE BEEN A FEW.

326
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:18,569
- BUT NO ONE
THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU.

327
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:22,707
I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

328
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,175
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.

329
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,144
- I KNOW HOW TO PERFORM
A LOBOTOMY.

330
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,281
- HER CELLULAR STRUCTURE'S
UNLIKE ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN.

331
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,683
- HER NITROGEN LEVELS
ARE OFF THE CHARTS.

332
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,556
- DO YOU THINK WE CAN HELP HER?

333
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:38,756
- TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION,
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

334
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:40,558
HOW SHE WORKS,
AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT,

335
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,427
FIRST WE HAVE TO STUDY HER
IN ACTION.

336
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,429
- YOU WANT HER TO BLOW STUFF UP.

337
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:46,298
YES, NOW WE'RE TALKING.
- NOT IN HERE.

338
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,299
SHE'S TOO UNSTABLE.
- I KNOW.

339
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,601
- I KNOW YOU KNOW.

340
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,303
- SO THIS IS YOUR LIFE NOW, HUH?

341
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,572
TESTING PEOPLE LIKE ME?

342
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,374
- STOPPING PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

343
00:17:56,406 --> 00:18:00,377
IT'S NOT WHAT I THOUGHT
I'D BE DOING.

344
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:02,180
ACTUALLY, ASIDE FROM BARRY,

345
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:04,715
YOU'RE THE FIRST META-HUMAN 
THAT WE'VE TESTED.

346
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:09,653
- "META-HUMAN"?
- IT'S JUST A TERM.

347
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:13,257
OH, MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?

348
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,326
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
THAT YOU WERE SHOT?

349
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,596
- IT JUST GRAZED ME.

350
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:20,231
- THERE'S SOMETHING IN THERE.

351
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,374
- A TRACKER.

352
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:35,379
- LOCK DOWN THE PIPELINE.
GET BETTE OUT OF HERE.

353
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:37,516
I'LL TAKE CARE OF EILING.

354
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,825
- HARRISON WELLS.
HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN.

355
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:48,492
- GENERAL.

356
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:51,529
- S.T.A.R. LABS.

357
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,666
THIS PLACE USED TO BE
SO IMPORTANT.

358
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:56,168
TELL ME, WHAT DOES ONE DO

359
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,569
AFTER SUCH A SPECTACULAR,
PUBLIC FAILURE?

360
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:02,641
- ONE ADAPTS.
ONE EVOLVES.

361
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:05,242
ONE BECOMES INTENT
ON REVERSING ONE'S FORTUNE.

362
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:07,546
- ALWAYS THE IDEALIST.

363
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:10,447
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, WADE?
- WHERE'S MY ASSET?

364
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,183
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

365
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,818
- WE TRACKED HER HERE, HARRISON.

366
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:15,520
TURN HER OVER TO ME
BEFORE YOU SEE THE REST

367
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:17,189
OF YOUR PRECIOUS PALACE CRUMBLE.

368
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:20,625
- OH, WADE, WADE, WADE.

369
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:28,599
- WE COULD'VE CHANGED
THE WORLD, YOU AND I.

370
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:42,947
- 427 KPA'S.

371
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,250
HER TRAUZL RATING IS AROUND 45.

372
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:47,519
THAT'S THE SAME
AS ANY PLASTIQUE.

373
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:50,654
PLASTIQUE.
HA--FIRST TRY!

374
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:53,458
- DIDN'T REALLY THINK
THIS ONE THROUGH, DID YOU?

375
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,897
DOWNRANGE, INSURGENTS
STARTED BOOBY TRAPPING CARS.

376
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,600
THE REST OF MY TOUR,
I WAS TERRIFIED

377
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:05,437
TO TOUCH ANOTHER VEHICLE.

378
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,971
NOW, I'M GONNA SPEND THE REST

379
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:12,310
OF MY LIFE TERRIFIED
TO TOUCH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

380
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:17,582
HAVE THEY TRIED TO HELP YOU?

381
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:20,652
- YEAH, THEY'VE HELPED ME LEARN
HOW TO USE MY POWERS.

382
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:22,519
NOT REVERSE THEM.

383
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:26,858
- IF THEY COULD REVERSE IT
SO YOU WEREN'T A META-HUMAN,

384
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:30,295
WOULD YOU?

385
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:34,298
- A FRIEND TOLD ME I WAS
GIVEN MY SPEED FOR A REASON.

386
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:37,769
THAT I WAS CHOSEN.

387
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:39,471
I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT,

388
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:43,607
BUT I ALWAYS WANTED
TO HELP PEOPLE.

389
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,576
NOW I CAN.

390
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:48,479
[cell phone vibrates]

391
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:51,782
SORRY.
HEY, JOE.

392
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:55,053
- I SEE YOUR LITTLE CONVERSATION
WITH IRIS WAS A ROUSING SUCCESS.

393
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:58,289
SHE JUST POSTED ANOTHER STORY
ABOUT THE STREAK.

394
00:20:58,323 --> 00:20:59,958
- JOE, I TRIED.
I REALLY TRIED.

395
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,893
- SHE'S GOT HER NAME ON IT NOW,
BARRY.

396
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:03,894
- WHAT?
JOE--

397
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:05,764
- IT'S MY FAULT, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE ASKED YOU TO SAY ANYTHING.

398
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:06,898
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW.

399
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,734
OKAY?
BYE.

400
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,806
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

401
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:17,509
- IRIS POSTED ABOUT THE STREAK
AGAIN.

402
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,410
SHE SIGNED HER NAME TO IT.

403
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:21,913
- OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD.
- NO.

404
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:23,682
- IF ONE OF THESE BAD
META-HUMANS

405
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:25,382
WE'RE DEALING WITH
FIGURES SHE KNOWS SOMETHING--

406
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:28,919
- THEN THEY MAY TARGET HER,
I KNOW.

407
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:36,427
[knock at door, bell chiming]

408
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,430
- SORRY, WE'RE CLOSED.

409
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:43,101
- OH, MY GOD, IT'S YOU.

410
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:44,669
- IRIS WEST,

411
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:45,903
I HEAR YOU'VE BEEN
WRITING ABOUT ME.

412
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:56,548
- YOU<i> ARE</i> REAL.

413
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,685
I SHOULD, UM...
LET ME JUST CLEAN UP--

414
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:06,590
- MEET ME ON THE ROOF.

415
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:08,326
I'LL GIVE YOU A HEAD START.

416
00:22:17,468 --> 00:22:21,005
I NEED YOU TO
STOP WRITING ABOUT ME.

417
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,774
- THERE ARE A LOT
OF PEOPLE WHO NEED SOMEONE

418
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,742
LIKE YOU RIGHT NOW.

419
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,912
TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE OUT THERE.

420
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:30,115
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS.

421
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:32,884
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

422
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,153
- I CAN'T SAY.

423
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:37,489
- WHO ARE YOU?

424
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:40,125
- I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT, EITHER.

425
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:44,495
- HOW CAN YOU DO WHAT YOU DO?

426
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:50,434
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE INTERVIEW.

427
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:52,771
- THERE'S MORE TO THIS
THAN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.

428
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,605
JUST TRUST ME, PLEASE.

429
00:22:54,638 --> 00:22:57,474
I NEED YOU TO STOP.

430
00:22:57,508 --> 00:22:59,477
- CAN YOU STOP?

431
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:01,479
RUNNING INTO BUILDINGS
AND RESCUING PEOPLE

432
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:03,414
WITHOUT THEM
EVEN KNOWING THAT YOU'RE THERE?

433
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,983
- I DON'T DO THIS FOR THE GLORY.

434
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,518
- SO WHY DO YOU?

435
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:15,893
LOOK, I HAVE THIS FRIEND,

436
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:20,831
AND HE HAD SOMETHING TERRIBLE
HAPPEN TO HIM WHEN HE WAS A KID.

437
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:23,168
HIS WHOLE LIFE,
HE'S BEEN TELLING STORIES

438
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:27,038
ABOUT THIS IMPOSSIBLE THING.

439
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:32,109
AND PEOPLE LAUGHED AT HIM.
AND SHRINKS ANALYZED HIM.

440
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:36,514
AND HE'S BEEN SEARCHING
FOR AN EXPLANATION EVER SINCE.

441
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:41,185
BUT NOW, SUDDENLY,
IT'S LIKE HE'S LOST HIS FAITH.

442
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,823
BUT YOU--YOU ARE PROOF
THAT HE WASN'T CRAZY.

443
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,596
HELP ME SAVE MY FRIEND.

444
00:23:55,932 --> 00:23:58,636
- HE'S A LUCKY GUY.

445
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:19,491
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

446
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:21,024
DID EILING FIND OUT YOU'RE HERE?

447
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:22,993
- NO.

448
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:27,699
CAITLIN WAS ABOUT TO GIVE ME
THE NOT-SO-GOOD NEWS.

449
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:29,834
- THE SHRAPNEL IN YOUR BODY

450
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:34,038
HAS MERGED WITH YOU
ON A CELLULAR LEVEL.

451
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,776
- AND THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIRED
TO UNSPLICE YOUR DNA--

452
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:41,613
IT HASN'T BEEN INVENTED YET.

453
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:49,653
- BETTE.

454
00:24:49,686 --> 00:24:54,558
- IT'S OKAY.
ROGER THAT.

455
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:57,595
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.
DON'T WORRY.

456
00:24:57,627 --> 00:24:59,730
PRETTY SURE I CAN CRY
WITHOUT BLOWING STUFF UP.

457
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:12,644
- WHAT NOW?
- SHE JOINS US.

458
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:14,778
BECOMES A PART OF THE TEAM.
- BARRY...

459
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:18,048
YOU HAVE AN AMAZING
ABILITY TO HELP PEOPLE.

460
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:21,886
SHE MAKES THINGS EXPLODE.

461
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,821
- SHE'S THE FIRST META-HUMAN
NOT HELL-BENT

462
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:25,123
ON DESTROYING THIS CITY.

463
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:26,890
- IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

464
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:28,292
- WELL, SHE'S NOT GOING
IN THE PIPELINE.

465
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,826
- I'M NOT SUGGESTING
SHE GO IN THE PIPELINE,

466
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:31,061
BUT WERE SHE TO REMAIN
AT S.T.A.R. LABS,

467
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:33,298
IT WOULD PUT ALL OF US AT RISK.

468
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,699
- FROM WHO?
EILING?

469
00:25:35,732 --> 00:25:37,034
- EILING IS A DANGEROUS MAN,
BARRY.

470
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:41,905
WE DO NOT WANT HIM AS AN ENEMY.

471
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:45,176
- AFTER THE LIGHTING BOLT,
WHAT IF YOU HADN'T FOUND ME?

472
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,978
IT COULD'VE BEEN ME.

473
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:51,816
HUNTED, ON THE RUN, CUT OFF FROM
EVERYONE I KNOW AND CARE ABOUT.

474
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:53,317
YOU GUYS SAVED ME.

475
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,788
- AND I WANT TO SAVE HER
JUST AS BAD AS YOU DO, BARRY.

476
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,889
WE ALL DO.

477
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:10,768
- JOE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

478
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,271
- GOING OVER THE MATERIALS
IN YOUR MOM'S CASE.

479
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:16,874
HOW'S IT GOING WITH YOU?

480
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:20,177
- STELLAR--I MADE FRIENDS
WITH A HUMAN BOMB

481
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:24,082
WHO I PROMISED I COULD HELP,
AND THEN, I COULDN'T.

482
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:29,753
AND I FINALLY DIAGNOSED WHY IRIS
IS WRITING ABOUT THE STREAK.

483
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:34,826
SHE'S DOING IT FOR ME.

484
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:38,962
TO PROVE THE IMPOSSIBLE
IS POSSIBLE.

485
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:42,233
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

486
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,102
- THE STREAK MAY HAVE TALKED
TO HER.

487
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:47,638
- BARRY, DON'T YOU THINK
IRIS WOULD RECOGNIZE YOUR VOICE?

488
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,240
- NO, I CAN DO THIS COOL THING
WITH MY VOCAL CORDS,

489
00:26:50,273 --> 00:26:54,144
WHERE I VIBRATE THEM
SO I SOUND LIKE THIS.

490
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:57,915
I KNOW.
IT'S COOL, IT'S COOL.

491
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:00,918
- WHOA.

492
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:05,189
WELL, YOU PUT THAT
OUT THERE NOW, SO.

493
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:09,727
I WANT TO KEEP HER SAFE.

494
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,261
- YOU KNOW THE ONLY REAL WAY
TO GET HER TO STOP

495
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:12,797
IS TO TELL HER THE TRUTH.

496
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:16,333
- MAN, YOU REALLY WANT
TO TELL HER.

497
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:20,104
- I TELL HER EVERYTHING.
- MM...

498
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:23,073
NOT EVERYTHING.

499
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:37,254
- IS IT THAT OBVIOUS?

500
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:41,058
- NOT TO HER.

501
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,895
- BUT HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN FOR?

502
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,230
- I HAVE WATCHED
YOU BE IN LOVE WITH IRIS

503
00:27:46,262 --> 00:27:48,832
SINCE YOU WERE OLD ENOUGH
TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS.

504
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:52,936
AND I'VE BEEN WAITING YEARS
FOR YOU TO TELL HER.

505
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:59,176
BUT YOU HAVEN'T.

506
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,079
- GUESS I WAS TOO SLOW.

507
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,849
NOW, SHE'S HAPPY
AND WITH SOMEONE ELSE, SO--

508
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:06,918
- WHEN THE UNIVERSE
WANTS TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN,

509
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,820
WHETHER IT BE GIVING A YOUNG MAN
LIGHTING SPEED

510
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,323
OR PUTTING TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER,

511
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:17,228
IT HAS A WAY
OF FIGURING THOSE THINGS OUT.

512
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,730
AND I GOT TO GET HOME.

513
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:26,403
- THANKS.

514
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,147
- CISCO?

515
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:39,417
- HE WENT HOME.

516
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,886
I THINK OUR CISCO'S DEVELOPING
A LITTLE BIT OF A CRUSH ON YOU.

517
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,890
- NOT SURE I'M PRIZE WINNING
DATE MATERIAL ANYMORE.

518
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:48,893
- CHANGE IS HARD.

519
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:52,496
THE SAME ACCIDENT THAT CHANGED
YOU PUT ME IN THIS CHAIR.

520
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:54,365
- SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

521
00:28:54,397 --> 00:28:57,033
- I DON'T SHARE THAT STORY
WITH YOU TO GARNER SYMPATHY.

522
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:58,836
I TELL IT TO YOU
TO ILLUSTRATE A LARGER POINT.

523
00:28:58,868 --> 00:29:00,270
- AND WHAT POINT IS THAT?

524
00:29:00,304 --> 00:29:05,143
- THAT I WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO GET BACK WHAT I LOST.

525
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:10,982
AS WOULD YOU.
- I WOULD.

526
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,417
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW.

527
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:20,557
- YOU SOLDIERS, YOU CALL
YOURSELVES SHEEP DOGS.

528
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,192
AM I RIGHT?

529
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:24,495
- HAPPY AND NORMAL UNTIL SOMEONE
ATTACKS OUR FLOCK.

530
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:26,463
- EVERY GOOD PERSON
WHO WAS CHANGED THAT NIGHT,

531
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:29,233
PEOPLE LIKE YOU,
PEOPLE LIKE BARRY ALLEN,

532
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:32,470
THOSE PEOPLE
ARE YOUR FLOCK NOW, BETTE.

533
00:29:32,502 --> 00:29:36,240
AND GENERAL EILING WILL NEVER
STOP ATTACKING THAT FLOCK,

534
00:29:36,272 --> 00:29:41,011
AND HE ALWAYS GETS HIS TARGET.

535
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,314
UNLESS YOU STOP HIM.

536
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:51,355
YOU KNOW YOUR DUTY, SERGEANT.

537
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:54,558
KILL EILING.

538
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:58,530
ONE LAST MISSION.
AND THEN YOU GO HOME.

539
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:17,081
- WHERE'S BETTE?

540
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:18,449
- SHE LEFT.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

541
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:20,451
WHERE DID SHE GO?
- SHE DIDN'T SAY.

542
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:22,519
- WELL, WHERE THE HELL
COULD SHE BE?

543
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:32,230
- GO, GO!
- GO, GO!

544
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:37,836
- ON ME.

545
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:44,208
- I'M READY TO GIVE MYSELF UP.

546
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,979
- OH, I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT.

547
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:52,549
YOU THINK YOU CAN PULL ONE
OVER ON ME?

548
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:55,052
YOU CAN'T.

549
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:56,287
STAND DOWN, SOLDIER.

550
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,654
- I GOT BACK
ON THE MILITARY FEED.

551
00:30:57,688 --> 00:30:58,956
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE GONE
TO THE WATERFRONT

552
00:30:58,989 --> 00:31:01,225
TO RENDEZVOUS WITH BETTE.

553
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:03,094
SHE'S TURNING HERSELF IN.

554
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:05,195
- SHE'S NOT TURNING HERSELF IN.

555
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:09,933
- PLEASE, LET HIM GET TO HER
IN TIME.

556
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:13,336
- ALL OVER THE WORLD, PEOPLE ARE
PLOTTING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY.

557
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:16,273
TO END OUR LIVES.

558
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,375
BRAVE AMERICAN SOLDIERS
ARE GONNA DIE IN THAT FIGHT,

559
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:19,677
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO.

560
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,948
BECAUSE OF YOU,
WE COULD HAVE VICTORY.

561
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,683
- ALL I'VE EVER WANTED WAS
TO MAKE THE WORLD A SAFER PLACE.

562
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:29,653
AND IT WILL BE
WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN IT.

563
00:31:29,686 --> 00:31:31,321
- TAKE COVER!

564
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:43,366
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

565
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,670
- BEING A SOLDIER
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE A MURDERER.

566
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:48,306
DON'T BECOME ONE NOW.

567
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:53,144
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T SEE HIM.

568
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:55,679
- DON'T BE.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

569
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:57,248
I'M GLAD YOU STOPPED ME.

570
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,581
- I'M GONNA GET YOU BACK
TO S.T.A.R. LABS.

571
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:04,622
- BARRY, DR. WELLS.
HE--HE--

572
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:18,234
- GUYS, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

573
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:21,005
- IS BETTE OKAY?

574
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,575
- NO.
EILING KILLED HER.

575
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:27,310
SHE'S GLOWING.
SHE'S GONNA DETONATE.

576
00:32:27,344 --> 00:32:29,246
- OH, MY GOD, A MASS THAT SIZE,
THE EXPLOSION, IT WOULD BE--

577
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:30,714
- DEVASTATING.

578
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,317
- BARRY, YOU HAVE TO GET HER
AWAY FROM THE CITY.

579
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:37,387
- BUT THERE'S NO TIME.

580
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:39,757
CAN I RUN ON WATER?

581
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:41,459
I BUILT UP ENOUGH SPEED
TO RUN UP A BUILDING.

582
00:32:41,491 --> 00:32:44,228
HOW FAST DO I NEED TO GO
TO RUN ON WATER?

583
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,262
- ASSUMING YOUR WEIGHT--

584
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:49,734
450 POUNDS OF FORCE PER STEP
FOR VERTICAL SUSPENSION.

585
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,134
ACCOUNTING FOR FLUID DRAG.

586
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:53,737
- APPROXIMATELY 650 MILES
AN HOUR.

587
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:59,143
- YOU HAVE TO OUTRUN
THE BLAST OR YOU'LL DIE TOO.

588
00:34:24,894 --> 00:34:26,230
- NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY
OCCURRED.

589
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:27,264
THE MILITARY WAS
SIMPLY CONDUCTING

590
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:30,233
AN UNDERWATER WEAPONS TEST.

591
00:34:30,266 --> 00:34:32,469
THERE IS NO NEED
FOR PANIC OR ALARM.

592
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,472
CENTRAL CITY IS SAFE.
I GUARANTEE YOU.

593
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:38,675
- HE MURDERED BETTE RIGHT
IN FRONT OF ME.

594
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,543
AND THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO TO HIM.

595
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:44,582
- POWERFUL MEN HAVE A WAY
OF AVOIDING CONSEQUENCES.

596
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:47,851
- YOU GONNA BE OKAY?
- YEAH.

597
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,820
- YOU CAN WALK ON WATER.

598
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:52,757
PUTS YOU IN PRETTY INTERESTING
COMPANY.

599
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:11,141
- IF YOU CAME TO DO LAUNDRY,
I ALREADY HAVE A LOAD IN.

600
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:14,778
- UH, NO.
I-I CAME TO TALK.

601
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:31,895
I WAS WORKING A CASE.

602
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:35,465
SOMEONE I REALLY THOUGHT
I COULD HELP BEFRIEND.

603
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:38,434
BUT THEY DIED.

604
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:40,236
- BARRY, I'M REALLY SORRY.

605
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:44,875
- I DIDN'T KNOW HER THAT WELL.
BUT IT STILL HURTS.

606
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:48,344
AND AS BAD AS I FEEL RIGHT NOW,

607
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:53,317
I KNOW HOW MUCH WORSE IT IS
TO LOSE SOMEONE WHO'S FAMILY.

608
00:35:55,219 --> 00:36:00,224
IRIS...WRITING ABOUT THIS STUFF,
PUTTING YOUR NAME OUT THERE,

609
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:02,326
IT'S DANGEROUS.

610
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:07,931
SO I'M ASKING YOU ONE LAST TIME,
PLEASE, STOP.

611
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,534
- AND I AM ASKING YOU
ONE LAST TIME

612
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:14,371
TO TELL ME WHAT IS REALLY
GOING ON WITH YOU.

613
00:36:14,403 --> 00:36:18,342
WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE OF US
WHO'S INTERESTED IN THIS?

614
00:36:30,853 --> 00:36:33,890
- I GUESS, JUST,
ALL THIS STUFF WITH MY FAMILY,

615
00:36:33,923 --> 00:36:38,929
I FINALLY JUST PUT IT BEHIND ME.

616
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:43,867
I'M ASKING YOU TO ALSO.

617
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,735
- THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
HOW THIS STARTED,

618
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:49,606
BUT IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING MORE
THAN THAT FOR ME NOW.

619
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:53,476
WHOEVER THIS STREAK IS,
WHEREVER HE COMES FROM,

620
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:57,615
I AM NOT STOPPING UNTIL THE REST
OF THE WORLD BELIEVES IN HIM.

621
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:11,262
- MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
SEE EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE.

622
00:37:14,998 --> 00:37:17,969
- YEAH.

623
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:38,722
CAN I GET ANOTHER CLUB
SODA, PLEASE?

624
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,496
- HEY.

625
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:47,431
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

626
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:49,799
- WE THOUGHT WE
SHOULD HAVE A TOAST.

627
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,802
- DOESN'T WORK ON ME, REMEMBER?

628
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,637
- BARRY ALLEN, YOU OF ALL PEOPLE

629
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,340
SHOULD KNOW
THAT NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE.

630
00:37:57,373 --> 00:38:01,411
I DISTILLED A HIGHLY FERMENTED,
POTENT SUSPENSION.

631
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,814
IT'S BASICALLY 500 PROOF.

632
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:08,419
I FIGURED IF ANYBODY COULD USE
A DRINK TONIGHT, IT WAS YOU.

633
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,887
SO HERE'S TO BETTE.

634
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:15,358
- BETTE.

635
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:22,865
WHOA, OH.

636
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:24,667
THAT HIT TOO QUICK.

637
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:26,936
- ARE YOU BUZZED?

638
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:30,740
- YEAH.
YEAH, I'M BUZZED FOR SURE.

639
00:38:30,773 --> 00:38:35,045
WHOA.
WHOA, THAT IS GOOD STUFF.

640
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,950
AND IT'S GONE.

641
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:41,751
- WORK IN PROGRESS.

642
00:38:41,784 --> 00:38:45,054
- FOR A GUY WHO HAS EXPERIENCED
HIS FAIR SHARE OF MYSTERIES,

643
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:47,024
ONE MYSTERY
I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT

644
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:50,059
IS WHY SOME PEOPLE
COME INTO OUR LIVES.

645
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:51,894
WHY SOME PEOPLE GO,

646
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:54,530
AND OTHERS BECOME A PART OF YOU.

647
00:38:54,563 --> 00:38:58,034
SOME FRIENDSHIPS
FEEL LIKE THEY'LL LAST FOREVER.

648
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:00,070
- HEY, SWEETHEART.
- HEY.

649
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:03,440
THERE'S DINNER IN THE FRIDGE.

650
00:39:03,472 --> 00:39:04,842
- OKAY, THANKS.

651
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,143
IRIS, ABOUT YOUR BLOG--

652
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:08,411
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

653
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:12,082
- AND OTHERS END FAR TOO SOON.

654
00:39:12,114 --> 00:39:15,818
NOT EVERY FRIENDSHIP
IS MEANT TO LAST A LIFETIME.

655
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:21,125
WHAT DOES LAST FOREVER IS THE
PAIN WHEN THAT PERSON IS GONE.

656
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:35,405
[alarm sounds]

657
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,748
- I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU,
HARRISON.

658
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,983
YOU'RE STILL ONE STEP AHEAD.

659
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:50,486
IMPRESSIVE FOR A MAN
WITHOUT THE USE OF HIS LEGS.

660
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,989
- I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, WADE.

661
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,958
- A GIRL WHO CAN TRANSFORM
ORDINARY OBJECTS

662
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,561
INTO EXPLOSIVES WITH THE TOUCH
OF HER HAND.

663
00:39:57,594 --> 00:40:00,563
TODAY I SAW A MAN WHO CAN MOVE
FASTER THAN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

664
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:02,499
EXTRAORDINARY.

665
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:05,035
THE NIGHT YOUR PARTICLE
ACCELERATOR DIED

666
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:07,504
WAS THE NIGHT
THE IMPOSSIBLE WAS BORN.

667
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:10,072
I THINK WE SHOULD START WORKING
TOGETHER AGAIN, HARRISON.

668
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:11,775
- I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

669
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:13,476
- YOU KNOW, I CAN HAVE
A SQUADRON OF SOLDIERS HERE

670
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,978
IN MINUTES.

671
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,880
- YOU KNOW, I CAN HAVE AN ARMY
OF PRESS HERE LIKE THAT.

672
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:18,815
BELIEVE ME, GENERAL,
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY

673
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,184
TO TESTIFY TO YOUR INVOLVEMENT

674
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:24,788
IN ACTIVITIES
THAT WERE LESS THAN HUMANE.

675
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,757
THREATEN ME AGAIN
AND I WILL END YOU, GENERAL.

676
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:31,095
AND I AM NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOUR CAREER.

677
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:39,670
- YOU KNOW, I FIGURED OUT
YOUR LITTLE SECRET, WELLS.

678
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:42,105
WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THE PUBLIC
CATCHES ON AS WELL.

679
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,253
THIS IS EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO ACHIEVE.

680
00:40:57,286 --> 00:41:00,623
- WE MAY HAVE THE SAME GOALS,
GENERAL, BUT NOT THE SAME MEANS.

681
00:41:00,657 --> 00:41:03,861
- I WILL NOT HAVE THIS PROJECT
END BEFORE IT EVEN BEGINS.

682
00:41:03,893 --> 00:41:06,128
- AND AS LONG
AS HE'S ON MY PREMISES,

683
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:09,131
I WILL NOT HAVE HIM SUBJECTED
TO THAT KIND OF CRUELTY ANYMORE.

684
00:41:09,164 --> 00:41:12,702
WE'RE DONE.

685
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:16,940
WE'RE DONE.
GENERAL.

686
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:20,143
GET OUT.

687
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:42,632
HEY.

688
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,568
IT'S OKAY.
- [heavy breathing]

689
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:46,936
- IT'S OKAY, BOY.

690
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:49,071
IT'S OKAY.
- [snarling]

691
00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:51,307
- HE'S GONE.

692
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,777
DON'T YOU WORRY.

693
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:57,780
I HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT FUTURE
IN MIND FOR YOU.

694
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,744
- GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
