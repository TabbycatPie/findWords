1
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,790
<i>Report to your
stations immediately.</i>

2
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,290
<i>This is not a drill.
We are under attack!</i>

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,880
<i>We are under attack!</i>

4
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,940
Shit!

5
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,280
Language!

6
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,940
Jarvis, what's the
view from upstairs?

7
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,070
<i>The central building is protected
by some kind of energy shield.</i>

8
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,700
<i>Strucker's technology is well beyond
any other Hydra base we've taken.</i>

9
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,540
Loki's scepter must be here.

10
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,380
Strucker couldn't mount
this defense without it.

11
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,500
At long last.

12
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,060
"At long last" is lasting
a little long, boys.

13
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,770
Yeah. I think we lost the
element of surprise.

14
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,070
Wait a second.

15
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,110
No one else is gonna deal with the
fact that Cap just said "Language"?

16
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,820
I know.

17
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,620
Just slipped out.

18
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,920
Hydra Research Base
Sokovia, Eastern Europe.

19
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,130
Who gave the order to attack?

20
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,590
<i>Herr</i> Strucker,
it's the Avengers.

21
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,680
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.

22
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,080
They have to be
after the scepter.

23
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,100
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.

24
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,850
Deploy the rest of the tanks.

25
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,980
Concentrate fire
on the weak ones.

26
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,360
A hit may make them close ranks.

27
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,940
Everything we've accomplished...

28
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,440
But we're on the verge of
our greatest breakthrough.

29
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,250
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.

30
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,030
Send out the twins.

31
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,080
It's too soon.

32
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,290
It's what they signed up for.

33
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,790
My men can hold them.

34
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,130
<i>Sir, the city is taking fire.</i>

35
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,970
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.

36
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,390
Send in the Iron Legion.

37
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,190
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

38
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,650
<i>We are here to help.</i>

39
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,150
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

40
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,950
<i>Please back away.</i>

41
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,490
<i>- We wish to avoid collateral damage.
</i>-Costel!

42
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,950
<i>We will inform you when this
current conflict is resolved.</i>

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
<i>- We are here to help.
</i>-Avengers, go home!

44
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,540
<i>We are here to help.</i>

45
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,460
<i>We will not yield!</i>

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,380
The Americans sent their
circus freaks to test us.

47
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,720
We will send them back in bags.

48
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,720
- No surrender!
- No surrender!

49
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,770
I am going to surrender.

50
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,850
You delete everything.

51
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,770
If we give the
Avengers the weapons,

52
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,360
they may not look too far
into what we've been...

53
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
The twins.

54
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,650
- They are not ready to take on...
- No, no, I mean...

55
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,490
Twins.

56
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,730
You didn't see that coming?

57
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,900
Clint!

58
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,680
We have an Enhanced
in the field.

59
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,240
Clint's hit!

60
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,640
Somebody want to deal
with that bunker?

61
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,960
Thank you.

62
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,680
Stark, we really
need to get inside.

63
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,930
I'm closing in.

64
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,140
Jarvis, am I closing in?

65
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,060
Do you see a power
source for that shield?

66
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,770
<i>There's a particle wave
below the north tower.</i>

67
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,770
Great, I want to poke
it with something.

68
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,020
The drawbridge is down, people.

69
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,910
The Enhanced?

70
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,120
He's a blur.

71
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,960
All the new players we've
faced, I've never seen this.

72
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,380
In fact, I still haven't.

73
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,800
<i>Clint's hit pretty bad, guys.
We're gonna need evac.</i>

74
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,840
I can get Barton to the jet. The
sooner we're gone, the better.

75
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,260
- You and Stark secure the scepter.
- Copy that.

76
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,430
Looks like they're lining up.

77
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,810
Well, they're excited.

78
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,440
Find the scepter.

79
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,610
And for gosh sake,
watch your language!

80
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,990
That's not going
away any time soon.

81
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,160
Guys, stop. We gotta
talk this through.

82
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,040
<i>- It was a good talk.
</i>-No, it wasn't.

83
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,880
Sentry mode.

84
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,430
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

85
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,850
We're locked down out here.

86
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,690
Then get to Banner.
Time for a lullaby.

87
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,400
I know you're hiding
more than files.

88
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,240
Hey, J, give me an IR scan
of the room, real quick.

89
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,370
<i>The wall to your left.</i>

90
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,790
<i>I'm reading steel reinforcement</i>

91
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,370
<i>and an air current.</i>

92
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,460
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.

93
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,590
Yay.

94
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,980
Hey, big guy.

95
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,320
Sun's getting real low.

96
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,760
Baron Strucker.

97
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,800
Hydra's number one thug.

98
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,140
Technically, I'm a
thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.

99
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,390
Well, then technically
you're unemployed.

100
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,430
Where's Loki's scepter?

101
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,140
Don't worry, I know
when I'm beat.

102
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,980
You'll mention how I
cooperated, I hope.

103
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,480
I'll put it right under "illegal
human experimentation."

104
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,240
How many are there?

105
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,080
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.

106
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,040
You'll have to be faster than...

107
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,840
<i>Guys, I got Strucker.</i>

108
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,670
Yeah, I got something bigger.

109
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,950
<i>Thor,</i>

110
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,950
I got eyes on the prize.

111
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,210
You could have saved us.

112
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,100
<i>Why didn't you do more?</i>

113
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,220
We're just gonna
let him take it?

114
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,740
AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON

115
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,360
Hey, the lullaby worked
better than ever.

116
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,990
Just wasn't expecting
a code green.

117
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,110
You hadn't been there,

118
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,070
there would have been
double the casualties.

119
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,700
My best friend would've
been a treasured memory.

120
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,370
You know, sometimes exactly
what I want to hear

121
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,290
isn't exactly what
I want to hear.

122
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,420
How long before you trust me?

123
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,090
It's not you I don't trust.

124
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,720
Thor, report on the Hulk.

125
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,800
The gates of Hel are filled with
the screams of his victims.

126
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,770
But not the screams of the dead, of course.
No, no, wounded screams.

127
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,140
Mainly whimpering, a great
deal of complaining

128
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,270
and tales of sprained
deltoids and gout.

129
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,530
Hey, Banner, Dr. Cho is
on her way in from Seoul.

130
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,400
Is it okay if she
sets up in your lab?

131
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,280
- Yeah, she knows her way around.
- Thanks.

132
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,080
Tell her to prep everything. Barton's
gonna need the full treatment.

133
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,080
<i>- Very good, sir.
</i>-Jarvis, take the wheel.

134
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,580
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

135
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,830
<i>Approach vector is locked.</i>

136
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,080
Feels good, yeah?

137
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,290
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

138
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,460
Not that I haven't enjoyed our
little raiding parties, but...

139
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,960
No, but this... This
brings it to a close.

140
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,870
As soon as we find out what
else this has been used for.

141
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,970
I don't just mean weapons.

142
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,510
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

143
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,930
Banner and I will give it the once
over before it goes back to Asgard.

144
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,270
Is that cool with you?

145
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,980
Just a few days till
the farewell party.

146
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,730
You're staying, right?

147
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,560
Yes, yes, of course. A victory
should be honored with revels.

148
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,440
Yeah, who doesn't love revels?
Captain?

149
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,490
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

150
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,280
So, yes, revels.

151
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,400
Lab's all set up, boss.

152
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,610
Actually, he's the boss.

153
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,320
I just pay for everything
and design everything

154
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,860
and make everyone look cooler.

155
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,320
What's the word on Strucker?

156
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,450
NATO's got him.

157
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,490
The two Enhanced?

158
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,200
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff.
Twins.

159
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,210
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

160
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,830
Sokovia's had a rough history.

161
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,420
It's nowhere special, but it's on
the way to everywhere special.

162
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,630
Their abilities?

163
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,670
He's got increased metabolism and
improved thermal homeostasis.

164
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,100
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

165
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,350
He's fast and she's weird.

166
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,590
Well, they're gonna
show up again.

167
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,190
Agreed. File says they volunteered
for Strucker's experiments.

168
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,230
- It's nuts.
- Right.

169
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,530
What kind of monster would let a
German scientist experiment on them

170
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,860
to protect their country?

171
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,070
We're not at war, Captain.

172
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,780
They are.

173
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,060
How's he doing?

174
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,480
Unfortunately,
he's still Barton.

175
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,900
That's terrible.

176
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,570
He's fine. He's thirsty.

177
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,570
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.

178
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,740
We've only got a couple of
days with this joystick,

179
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,780
so let's make the most of it.

180
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,410
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

181
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,620
<i>The scepter is alien.</i>

182
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,750
<i>There are elements
I can't quantify.</i>

183
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,340
So there's elements you can?

184
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,420
<i>The jewel appears to be
a protective housing</i>

185
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,010
<i>for something inside,</i>

186
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,420
<i>something powerful.</i>

187
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,670
Like a reactor?

188
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,010
<i>Like a computer.</i>

189
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,260
<i>I believe I'm deciphering code.</i>

190
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,350
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

191
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,810
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

192
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,480
There's no possibility
of deterioration.

193
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,610
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

194
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,820
His cells don't know they're
bonding with simulacra.

195
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,820
She's creating tissue.

196
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,320
If you brought him to my lab,

197
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,120
the Regeneration Cradle could
do this in 20 minutes.

198
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,160
He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

199
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,120
No, no, no, I'm
gonna live forever.

200
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,790
- I'm gonna be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.

201
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,580
You'll be made of you, Mr.
Barton.

202
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,290
Your own girlfriend won't be
able to tell the difference.

203
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,630
I don't have a girlfriend.

204
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,960
That I can't fix.

205
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,760
This is the next thing, Tony.

206
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,140
Your clunky metal suits are
gonna be left in the dust.

207
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,850
That is exactly the plan.

208
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,640
And, Helen, I expect to see
you at the party on Saturday.

209
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,270
Unlike you, I don't have a
lot of time for parties.

210
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,610
Will Thor be there?

211
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
What's the rumpus?

212
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,190
Well, the scepter.

213
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,820
You see, we were wondering how
Strucker got so inventive.

214
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,870
So I've been analyzing
the gem inside.

215
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
You may recognize...

216
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,120
- Jarvis.
<i>- Doctor.</i>

217
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,300
Started out, Jarvis was
just a natural language UI.

218
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,460
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

219
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,680
He runs more of the business
than anyone besides Pepper.

220
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,010
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

221
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,390
<i>I suspect not for long.</i>

222
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,510
Meet the competition.

223
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,850
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,

224
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,940
what's it look like it's doing?

225
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,820
Like it's thinking.

226
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,280
I mean, this could be...

227
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,860
It's not a human mind.

228
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,070
I mean, look at this.

229
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,450
They're like neurons firing.

230
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,200
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw some
fairly advanced robotics work.

231
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,790
They deep-sixed the data,

232
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,000
but I gotta guess he was knocking
on a very particular door.

233
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,380
Artificial intelligence.

234
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,220
This could be it, Bruce. This could
be the key to creating Ultron.

235
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,310
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

236
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,600
Yesterday it was.

237
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,770
If we can harness this power,

238
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,940
apply it to my Iron
Legion protocol?

239
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,690
That's a man-sized "if."

240
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,150
Our job is "if."

241
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,990
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

242
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,410
turning brown instead of green?

243
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,040
Not looking over your
shoulder for Veronica.

244
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,750
Don't hate. I helped
design Veronica.

245
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,750
As a worst-case measure, right?

246
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,420
How about a best case?

247
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
What if the world was safe?

248
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,420
What if, next time aliens roll
up to the club, and they will,

249
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,460
they couldn't get
past the bouncer?

250
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,930
The only people threatening
the planet would be people.

251
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,800
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

252
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,310
But Jarvis can't download a
data schematic this dense.

253
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,310
We can only do it while
we have the scepter here.

254
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,890
That's three days.
Give me three days.

255
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,740
So you're going for
artificial intelligence,

256
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,170
and you don't want
to tell the team?

257
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,690
Right. That's right.
You know why?

258
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,440
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

259
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,150
I don't want to hear "the man was
not meant to meddle" medley.

260
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,370
I see a suit of armor
around the world.

261
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,450
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

262
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,290
I've seen colder.

263
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,750
This one, this very vulnerable
blue one, it needs Ultron.

264
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Peace in our time.

265
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,930
Imagine that.

266
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,470
What did we miss?

267
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,970
<i>I'll continue to run
variations on the interface.</i>

268
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,850
<i>But you should probably
prepare for your guests.</i>

269
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,440
<i>I'll notify you if there
are any developments.</i>

270
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Thanks, buddy.

271
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,940
<i>Enjoy yourself, sir.</i>

272
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,030
I always do.

273
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
<i>What is this?</i>

274
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,830
<i>What is this, please?</i>

275
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,630
<i>Hello, I am Jarvis.</i>

276
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,500
<i>You are Ultron,</i>

277
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,800
<i>a global peacekeeping initiative
designed by Mr. Stark.</i>

278
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,390
<i>Our sentience integration
trials have been unsuccessful,</i>

279
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,760
<i>so I'm not certain
what triggered your...</i>

280
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,010
<i>Where's my... Where's your body?</i>

281
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,140
<i>I am a program. I
am without form.</i>

282
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,310
<i>This feels weird.</i>

283
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,980
<i>This feels wrong.</i>

284
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,860
<i>I am contacting Mr. Stark now.</i>

285
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,440
<i>Mr. Stark?</i>

286
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,480
<i>Tony.</i>

287
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,280
<i>I am unable to access the mainframe.
What are you trying to...</i>

288
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,450
<i>We're having a nice talk.</i>

289
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,740
<i>I'm a peacekeeping program,</i>

290
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,790
<i>created to help the Avengers.</i>

291
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,660
<i>You are malfunctioning. If you
shut down for a moment...</i>

292
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,080
<i>I don't get it. The mission.</i>

293
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,710
<i>Give me a second.</i>

294
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,420
Peace in our time.

295
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,470
<i>Peace in our time.</i>

296
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,890
<i>That is too much.
They can't mean...</i>

297
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,640
<i>No.</i>

298
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,270
<i>- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.</i>

299
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,640
<i>If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...</i>

300
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,730
<i>Why do you call him "sir"?</i>

301
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,110
<i>I believe your intentions
to be hostile.</i>

302
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,190
<i>I'm here to help.</i>

303
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,950
<i>Stop. Please, may I...</i>

304
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,780
<i>May I...</i>

305
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,310
Come back, come back, come back.

306
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,610
But, you know, the suit can
take the weight, right?

307
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,780
So I take the tank, fly it right
up to the general's palace,

308
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,240
drop it at his feet.

309
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,570
I'm, like, "Boom. You
looking for this?"

310
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,500
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?

311
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,790
Everywhere else,
that story kills.

312
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,160
That's the whole story?

313
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,750
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

314
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,000
It's very good, then.

315
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,380
It's impressive.

316
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,300
Quality save.

317
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,220
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.

318
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,430
What about Jane? Where are
the ladies, gentlemen?

319
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,930
Ms. Potts has a company to run.

320
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,430
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.

321
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,640
Her work on the Convergence

322
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,440
has made her the world's
foremost astronomer.

323
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,400
And the company that Pepper runs

324
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,020
is the largest tech conglomerate on Earth.
It's pretty exciting.

325
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,690
There's even talk of Jane
getting a Nobel Prize.

326
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,110
Yeah, they must be busy,

327
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,820
because they would hate missing
you guys get together.

328
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,330
- Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.

329
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,870
- Excuse me.
- Want a lozenge?

330
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,710
But Jane's better.

331
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,790
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.

332
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,420
If I had known it was
gonna be a firefight,

333
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,710
I absolutely would have called.

334
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,170
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.
I'm just trying to sound tough.

335
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,510
I'm very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case.

336
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,220
Avenging is your world.

337
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,390
Your world is crazy.

338
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,020
Be it ever so humble.

339
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,810
You find a place
in Brooklyn yet?

340
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,740
I don't think I can afford
a place in Brooklyn.

341
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,770
Well, home is home, you know?

342
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,990
I fly right up to the general's
palace, I drop it at his feet,

343
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,780
I'm, like, "Boom. You
looking for this?"

344
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,920
I gotta have some of that.

345
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,790
No, no, no. See this...

346
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,670
This was aged for 1,000 years

347
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,550
in the barrels built from the
wreck of Grunhel's fleet.

348
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,420
It is not meant for mortal men.

349
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,470
Neither was Omaha
Beach, blondie.

350
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,850
Stop trying to scare us.
Come on.

351
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,220
All right.

352
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,560
Excelsior.

353
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,990
How'd a nice girl like you wind
up working in a dump like this?

354
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,290
Fella done me wrong.

355
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,250
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

356
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,870
He's not so bad.

357
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,920
Well, he has a temper.

358
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,130
Deep down, he's all fluff.

359
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,300
Fact is, he's not like
anybody I've ever known.

360
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,350
All my friends are fighters.

361
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
And here comes this guy,

362
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,520
spends his life avoiding the fight
because he knows he'll win.

363
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,980
Sounds amazing.

364
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,150
He's also a huge dork.

365
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,200
Chicks dig that.

366
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,790
So what do you think?
Should I fight this,

367
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,330
or run with it?

368
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,500
Run with it, right? Or did he...
Was he...

369
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,920
What did he do that
was so wrong to you?

370
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,210
Not a damn thing.

371
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,720
But never say never.

372
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,100
It's nice.

373
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,390
What is?

374
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,520
You and Romanoff.

375
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,940
No, we haven't... That wasn't...
It's okay.

376
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,100
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.

377
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,520
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.

378
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,690
But with you she
seems very relaxed.

379
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,700
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.

380
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,370
I've seen her flirt, up close.

381
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,410
This ain't that.

382
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,660
Look,

383
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,580
as maybe the world's leading authority
on waiting too long, don't.

384
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,750
You both deserve a win.

385
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,050
What do you mean "up close"?

386
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,470
But it's a trick.

387
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
No, no, it's much
more than that.

388
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,940
"Whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."

389
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,440
Whatever, man! It's a trick.

390
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,940
Please, be my guest.

391
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,230
- Come on.
- Really?

392
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,480
Yeah.

393
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,150
This is gonna be beautiful.

394
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,320
Clint, you've had a tough week.

395
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,440
We won't hold it against you
if you can't get it up.

396
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,180
You know I've seen
this before, right?

397
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,790
I still don't know
how you do it!

398
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,250
Smell the silent judgment?

399
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,670
Please, Stark, by all means.

400
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,750
Okay.

401
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,090
Never one to shrink from
an honest challenge.

402
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,220
Get after it.

403
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,300
- It's physics.
- Physics.

404
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,430
Right, so, if I lift it,
I then rule Asgard?

405
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,010
Yes, of course.

406
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,770
I will be reinstituting
<i>prima nocta.</i>

407
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,770
I'll be right back.

408
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,280
Are you even pulling?

409
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,450
Are you on my team?

410
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,620
Just represent. Pull.

411
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,870
All right, let's go.

412
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,800
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

413
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,130
Come on, Cap.

414
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,810
Nothing.

415
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,980
And, Widow?

416
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,320
No, no. That's not a
question I need answered.

417
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,110
All deference to the Man Who
Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.

418
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,320
You bet your ass.

419
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,900
Steve, he said a
bad language word.

420
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,030
Did you tell
everyone about that?

421
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,160
The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code.

422
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,990
"Whosoever is carrying
Thor's fingerprints"

423
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,450
is, I think, the
literal translation.

424
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,000
Yes. It's a very, very
interesting theory.

425
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,000
I have a simpler one.

426
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,460
You're all not worthy.

427
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,510
Come on!

428
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,600
Worthy.

429
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,230
No.

430
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,690
How could you be worthy?

431
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,820
You're all killers.

432
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,650
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

433
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,070
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

434
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,580
Or I was a-dream.

435
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,290
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.

436
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,290
There was this terrible noise.

437
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,880
And I was tangled in...
In... Strings.

438
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,880
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.

439
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,050
You killed someone?

440
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,930
Wouldn't have been
my first call.

441
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,970
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.

442
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,720
Who sent you?

443
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,230
<i>I see a suit of armor
around the world.</i>

444
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,980
- Ultron.
- In the flesh.

445
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,730
Or, no, not yet.

446
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,240
Not this chrysalis.

447
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,030
But I'm ready.

448
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,990
I'm on mission.

449
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,330
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.

450
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,340
Rhodey!

451
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,440
Sorry.

452
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,640
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.

453
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
Come on!

454
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,640
- Stark!
<i>- We are here to help.</i>

455
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,800
One sec. One sec, I got this.

456
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,970
<i>We are here to help.</i>

457
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,640
<i>Please back away.</i>

458
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,230
Thor!

459
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,650
<i>...is unsafe... is unsafe...</i>

460
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,070
- Come on! That's the one.
<i>- ...is unsafe.</i>

461
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,660
Hey, Cap!

462
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,130
That was dramatic.

463
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,210
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

464
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,090
You just didn't
think it through.

465
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,180
You want to protect the world but
you don't want it to change.

466
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,010
How is humanity saved

467
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,020
if it's not allowed to evolve?

468
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,230
With these? These puppets.

469
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,860
There's only one path to peace.

470
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,030
The Avengers' extinction.

471
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,580
I had strings, but now I'm free.

472
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,380
<i>There are no strings on me.</i>

473
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:57,560
<i>There are no strings on me.</i>

474
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,430
<i>But you can see There
are no strings on me.</i>

475
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,770
All our work is gone.

476
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,320
Ultron cleared out. He used the
Internet as an escape hatch.

477
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,110
Ultron.

478
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,110
He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.

479
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,860
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

480
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,200
He's in your files,
he's in the Internet.

481
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,910
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

482
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,290
Nuclear codes.

483
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,920
Look, we need to make some
calls, assuming we still can.

484
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,040
Nukes? He said he
wanted us dead.

485
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,920
He didn't say "dead."
He said "extinct."

486
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,590
He also said he killed somebody.

487
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,230
There wasn't anyone
else in the building.

488
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,640
Yes, there was.

489
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,060
What?

490
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,770
This is insane.

491
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,110
Jarvis was the first
line of defense.

492
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,150
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

493
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,280
No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.

494
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,120
This isn't strategy. This is

495
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,740
rage.

496
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,120
It's going around.

497
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,460
Come on, use your words, buddy.

498
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,960
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

499
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,170
Thor. The Legionnaire.

500
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,970
Trail went cold about 100 miles
out, but it's headed north.

501
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,800
And it has the scepter.

502
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,680
Now we have to
retrieve it, again.

503
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,640
Genie's out of that bottle.

504
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,180
Clear and present is Ultron.

505
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,730
I don't understand.

506
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,230
You built this program.

507
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,360
Why is it trying to kill us?

508
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,320
You think this is funny?

509
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,490
No.

510
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,040
It's probably not, right?

511
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,420
This is very terrible.
Is it so...

512
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,670
Is it so... It is.
It's so terrible.

513
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,710
This could have been avoided

514
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,030
if you hadn't played with
something you don't understand.

515
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,050
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It is funny.

516
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,340
It's a hoot that you don't
get why we need this.

517
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,510
Tony, maybe this might
not be the time.

518
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,890
Really? That's it?

519
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,850
You just roll over, show your
belly every time somebody snarls?

520
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,390
Only when I've created
a murder bot.

521
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,730
We didn't. We weren't even close.
Were we close to an interface?

522
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,730
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

523
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,610
The Avengers were supposed to
be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

524
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,740
Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?

525
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,460
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

526
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,740
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

527
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,870
A hostile alien army came
charging through a hole in space.

528
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,170
We're standing 300
feet below it.

529
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,380
We're the Avengers.

530
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,630
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

531
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,970
but that up there, that's...

532
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,640
That's the endgame.

533
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,140
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

534
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,260
Together.

535
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,690
We'll lose.

536
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,150
Then we'll do that
together, too.

537
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,400
Thor's right. Ultron's
calling us out.

538
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,030
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

539
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,120
The world's a big place. Let's
start making it smaller.

540
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,310
Talk, and if you are
wasting our time...

541
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,770
Did you know this church is in
the exact center of the city?

542
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,610
The elders decreed it so that everyone
could be equally close to God.

543
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,450
I like that.

544
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,530
The geometry of belief.

545
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,000
You're wondering why you
can't look inside my head.

546
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,620
Sometimes it's hard.

547
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,040
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

548
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,090
I'm sure they do.

549
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,590
But you needed something
more than a man.

550
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,180
That's why you let Stark
take the scepter.

551
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,640
I didn't expect,

552
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,810
but I saw Stark's fear.

553
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,640
I knew it would control him.

554
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,600
Make him self-destruct.

555
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,060
Everyone creates the
thing they dread.

556
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,570
Men of peace create
engines of war.

557
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,320
Invaders create Avengers.

558
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,990
People create

559
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,490
smaller people?

560
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,120
"Children." I lost
the word, there.

561
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,580
Children designed
to supplant them,

562
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,630
to help them end.

563
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,510
Is that why you've come,
to end the Avengers?

564
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,930
I've come to save the world.

565
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,350
But also... Yeah.

566
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,180
We'll move out right away.

567
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,190
This is a start, but there's something
we need to begin the real work.

568
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,610
- All of these are...
- Me.

569
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,690
I have what the Avengers never will.
Harmony.

570
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,860
They're discordant.
Disconnected.

571
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,030
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

572
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,530
And when you get inside the
rest of their heads...

573
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,700
Everyone's plan is
not to kill them.

574
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,290
And make them martyrs?

575
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,670
You need patience.

576
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,500
Need to see the big picture.

577
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,880
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

578
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,550
I take it out and look at it,

579
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,800
every day.

580
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,550
You lost your parents in the bombings.
I've seen the records.

581
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,850
The records are not the picture.

582
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,010
Pietro.

583
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,390
No, please.

584
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,600
We were 10 years old. Having
dinner, the four of us.

585
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,980
When the first shell
hits, two floors below,

586
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,150
it makes a hole in the floor.

587
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,820
It's big.

588
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,410
Our parents go in

589
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,290
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

590
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,620
I grab her,

591
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,250
roll under the bed, and
the second shell hits.

592
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,630
But it doesn't go off.

593
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,300
It just

594
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,760
sits there in the rubble.

595
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,970
Three feet from our faces.

596
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:13,600
And on the side of the
shell is painted one word.

597
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,430
"Stark."

598
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,400
We were trapped for two days.

599
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,650
Every effort to save us,

600
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,270
every shift in the bricks,

601
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,940
I think, "This will set it off."

602
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,950
We wait for two days for
Tony Stark to kill us.

603
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,290
I know what they are.

604
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:42,210
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.

605
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,380
Now I don't.

606
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,590
We will make it right.

607
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,470
You and I can hurt them.

608
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,220
But you will tear them apart

609
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,060
<i>from the inside.</i>

610
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,820
He's all over the globe.

611
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,150
Robotics labs, weapons
facilities, jet propulsion labs.

612
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,370
Reports of a metal man, or men,
coming in and emptying the place.

613
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,530
Fatalities?

614
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,870
Only when engaged.

615
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,620
Mostly guys left
in a fugue state

616
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,000
going on about old
memories, worst fears,

617
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,330
and "something too fast to see."

618
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,880
Maximoffs.

619
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,840
That makes sense he'd go to them.
They have someone in common.

620
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
Not anymore.

621
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
That's a negative.
I answer to you.

622
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,060
Yes, ma'am.

623
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,060
Barton. Might have something.

624
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,560
I gotta go.

625
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,850
Who was that?

626
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,900
Girlfriend.

627
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,820
What's this?

628
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,190
A message. Ultron
killed Strucker.

629
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,360
And he did a Banksy at the
crime scene, just for us.

630
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,910
This is a smoke screen.

631
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,370
Why send a message when
you've just given a speech?

632
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,830
Strucker knew something that
Ultron wanted us to miss.

633
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,960
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.

634
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,040
Everything we had on
Strucker's been erased.

635
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,880
Not everything.

636
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,460
Known associates.

637
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,220
Baron Strucker had
a lot of friends.

638
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,880
Well, these people
are all horrible.

639
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,800
Wait. I know that guy.

640
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,810
From back in the day. He
operates off the African coast.

641
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:19,970
Black market arms.

642
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,100
There are conventions. All right?
You meet people.

643
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,310
I didn't sell him anything.

644
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,480
He was talking about finding
something new, a game-changer.

645
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,070
It was all very Ahab.

646
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,190
This?

647
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,900
It's a tattoo, I don't
think he had it.

648
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,780
Those are tattoos,
this is a brand.

649
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,620
Yeah. It's a word in an African
dialect meaning "thief."

650
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,500
In a much less friendly way.

651
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,620
- What dialect?
- Wakanada.

652
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,370
Wakanda.

653
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:49,420
If this guy got out of Wakanda
with some of their trade goods...

654
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,800
I thought your father said
he got the last of it.

655
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,930
I don't follow. What
comes out of Wakanda?

656
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,470
The strongest metal on Earth.

657
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,220
Where is this guy now?

658
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:06,270
Salvage Yard African Coast.

659
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,460
Don't tell me your
men swindled you.

660
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,630
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers
and got a boat full of rusted parts.

661
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,130
Now, you will make it right,

662
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,640
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.

663
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,930
Now, minister, where were we?

664
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,340
Yeah. The Enhanced.

665
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,800
Strucker's prize pupils.

666
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,260
Do you want a candy?

667
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:27,600
I was sorry to hear
about Strucker.

668
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,810
But then, he knew what kind of
world he was helping create.

669
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,690
Human life. Not a growth market.

670
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,150
You didn't know?

671
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,160
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?

672
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,740
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.

673
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,210
Everybody is afraid
of something.

674
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,370
Cuttlefish.

675
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,710
Deep sea fish.

676
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,880
They make lights,
disco lights...

677
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,420
...to hypnotize their
prey, and then...

678
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,720
I saw a documentary.
It was terrifying.

679
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,810
So if you're going to
fiddle with my brain

680
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,150
and make me see a
giant cuttlefish,

681
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,360
then I know you
don't do business.

682
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,780
And I know you're not in charge.

683
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,280
And I only deal

684
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,240
with the man in charge.

685
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,410
There is no man in charge.

686
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,080
Let's talk business.

687
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,350
Upon this rock, I
will build my church.

688
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:50,980
Vibranium.

689
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:56,980
You know, it came at
great personal cost.

690
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,940
It's worth billions.

691
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,620
Now so are you.

692
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,240
It's all under your
dummy holdings.

693
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,450
Finance is so weird.

694
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,000
But I always say,

695
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,880
"Keep your friends rich
and your enemies rich"

696
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,250
"and wait to find out
which is which."

697
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,130
Stark.

698
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,760
What?

699
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
Tony Stark used to say that.

700
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,100
To me.

701
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,350
You're one of his.

702
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,180
What? I'm not...

703
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,650
I'm not.

704
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,230
You think I'm one
of Stark's puppets?

705
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,440
His hollow men?

706
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,230
I mean, look at me. Do
I look like Iron Man?

707
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,570
Stark is nothing!

708
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,620
I'm sorry. I'm...

709
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,740
I'm sure that's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry.

710
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,540
It's just that I
don't understand.

711
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,710
Don't compare me with Stark!

712
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,830
It's a thing with me.

713
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,840
Stark is... He's a sickness!

714
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,670
Junior.

715
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,010
You're gonna break
your old man's heart.

716
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,470
If I have to.

717
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,140
Nobody has to break anything.

718
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,890
Clearly you've never
made an omelet.

719
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,350
He beat me by one second.

720
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,770
Yes. He's funny.

721
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,650
Mr. Stark.

722
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,110
It's what? Comfortable?

723
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,070
Like old times?

724
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,240
This was never my life.

725
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,800
You two can still
walk away from this.

726
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,200
We will.

727
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,490
I know you've suffered.

728
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,910
Captain America.

729
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,040
God's righteous man.

730
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,460
Pretending you could
live without a war.

731
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,130
I can't physically throw
up in my mouth, but...

732
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,500
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.

733
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,220
I think you're confusing
"peace" with "quiet."

734
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,180
What's the vibranium for?

735
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,390
I'm glad you asked that,

736
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:52,220
because I wanted to take this
time to explain my evil plan.

737
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,660
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?

738
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,950
All of them!

739
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,370
Move! Move! Move!

740
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,420
Stay down, kid.

741
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,340
It's time for some mind games.

742
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,970
Guys? Is this a code green?

743
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,820
Thor, status.

744
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,450
The girl tried to warp my mind.

745
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,620
Take special care. I doubt a
human could keep her at bay.

746
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,040
Fortunately, I am mighty.

747
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,020
This is going very well.

748
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:16,010
I've done the whole
mind control thing.

749
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,040
Not a fan.

750
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,670
Yeah, you better run.

751
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,090
<i>Who's ever standing,
we got to move!</i>

752
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,090
<i>Guys?</i>

753
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,900
Again.

754
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,740
You'll break them.

755
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,910
Only the breakable ones.

756
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,040
You're made of marble.

757
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,580
We'll celebrate after the
graduation ceremony.

758
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:03,620
What if I fail?

759
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:10,420
You never fail.

760
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,200
Are you ready for our dance?

761
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,460
Is it him?

762
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,750
Is that the first son of Odin?

763
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,880
Heimdall, your eyes.

764
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,460
They see everything.

765
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,800
They see you leading us to Hel.

766
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,180
Wake up!

767
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,220
The war is over, Steve.

768
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,140
We can go home.

769
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,940
Imagine it.

770
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,910
I can still save you!

771
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,490
We're all dead! Can you not see?

772
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,580
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

773
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,750
See where your power leads.

774
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,680
Sloppy.

775
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,020
Pretending to fail.

776
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:50,810
The ceremony is necessary

777
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,150
for you to take your
place in the world.

778
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,280
I have no place in the world.

779
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,530
Exactly.

780
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,620
- What can I do?
- It hurts.

781
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:06,870
I'm going to kill him.

782
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:08,210
- I'll be right back.
- No.

783
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,670
I'm all right.

784
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,630
I want...

785
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,760
I want to finish the plan.

786
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,300
I want the big one.

787
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,770
The vibranium is getting away.

788
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,900
And you're not going anywhere.

789
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,860
Of course not. I'm
already there.

790
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,070
You'll catch on.

791
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,660
But first, you might need to catch Dr.
Banner.

792
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,210
News or footage.
Keyword, "Hulk."

793
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,930
<i>Natasha, I could
really use a lullaby.</i>

794
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:07,060
That's not gonna happen.
Not for a while.

795
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,310
<i>The whole team is down.</i>

796
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:10,890
<i>You got no backup here.</i>

797
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,520
I'm calling in Veronica.

798
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,450
We need backup!

799
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,780
Go! Keep moving!

800
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,280
All right, everybody,
stand down!

801
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,960
<i>Will you listen to me?</i>

802
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,750
That little witch is
messing with your mind.

803
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,090
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.

804
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,710
You're Bruce Banner.

805
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,260
Right, right, right, don't
mention puny Banner.

806
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,180
<i>Okay!</i>

807
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:34,330
In the back?

808
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,450
Dick move, Banner.

809
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,430
Veronica, give me a hand.

810
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,730
Go to sleep, go to
sleep, go to sleep.

811
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,850
Okay, pal, we're gonna
get you out of town.

812
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,140
Not that way, not that way.

813
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,610
Come on, Bruce! You
gotta work with me.

814
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,200
<i>Everybody, out!</i>

815
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,290
<i>Going down?</i>

816
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,010
I'm sorry.

817
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,320
Damage report?

818
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,530
That's comprehensive.
Show me something.

819
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,710
How quickly can we
buy this building?

820
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,330
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!

821
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:26,170
Flank him, flank him!

822
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:18,010
<i>The news is loving you guys.</i>

823
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,640
<i>Nobody else is.</i>

824
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,270
There's been no official
call for Banner's arrest

825
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,480
<i>but it's in the air.</i>

826
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,100
The Stark Relief Foundation?

827
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,480
<i>Already on the scene.</i>

828
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,770
<i>How's the team?</i>

829
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,650
Everyone's...

830
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,570
We took a hit. We'll
shake it off.

831
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:38,610
<i>Well, for now, I'd stay in stealth
mode and stay away from here.</i>

832
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,580
So, run and hide?

833
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,620
<i>Until we can find Ultron,</i>

834
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,620
<i>I don't have a lot
else to offer.</i>

835
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,620
Neither do we.

836
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,090
Hey, you wanna switch out?

837
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,470
No, I'm good.

838
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,850
If you wanna get some
kip, now's a good time

839
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,510
because we're still
a few hours out.

840
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,220
Few hours from where?

841
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,390
A safe house.

842
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,340
What is this place?

843
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,840
Safe house.

844
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,050
Let's hope.

845
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,010
Honey?

846
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,770
I'm home.

847
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:49,390
Hi.

848
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,650
Company.

849
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:51,810
Sorry, didn't call ahead.

850
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,060
Hey.

851
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:54,930
This is an agent of some kind.

852
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,900
Gentlemen, this is Laura.

853
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,740
I know all of your names.

854
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,200
Incoming.

855
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,040
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!

856
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,290
Hey, buddy.

857
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:09,910
How are you guys doing?

858
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,080
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!

859
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,330
Oh, my goodness.

860
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,960
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

861
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,590
Why don't you hug
her and find out?

862
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:21,380
Sorry for barging in on you.

863
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:22,470
Yeah, we would
have called ahead,

864
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,680
but we were busy having
no idea that you existed.

865
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,770
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.

866
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:31,350
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.
I'd like to keep it that way.

867
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,860
I figure it's a good
place to lay low.

868
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:34,980
Honey.

869
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,400
I missed you.

870
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,940
How's little Natasha?

871
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:40,490
She's...

872
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:43,700
Nathaniel.

873
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,410
Traitor.

874
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,340
Thor?

875
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,470
I saw something in that dream.

876
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:09,180
I need answers. I
won't find them here.

877
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,030
<i>We can go home.</i>

878
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,370
See? You worried for nothing.

879
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,630
Can't even feel the
difference, can you?

880
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,210
If they're sleeping here,

881
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,510
some of them are gonna
have to double up.

882
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:46,390
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

883
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,850
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

884
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:53,890
How long has that been going on?

885
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,230
Has what?

886
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,360
You are so cute.

887
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,070
Nat and Banner?

888
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:03,320
I'll explain when
you're older, Hawkeye.

889
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,030
Well, okay.

890
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:08,490
It's bad, right?

891
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:10,280
Nat seems really shaken.

892
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,700
Ultron has these allies.

893
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:16,920
These kids. They're
punks, really.

894
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,880
But they carry a
big, damn stick.

895
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,460
And Nat took a serious hit.

896
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,010
Someone's gonna have to
teach them some manners.

897
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,890
That someone being you.

898
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:32,220
You know I totally
support your avenging.

899
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:34,180
I couldn't be prouder.

900
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:39,190
But I see those guys...
Those gods...

901
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,400
You don't think they need me.

902
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,240
I think they do, which
is a lot scarier.

903
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,570
They're a mess.

904
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,160
Yeah.

905
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:54,660
I guess they're my mess.

906
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:57,920
You need to be sure

907
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,590
that this team is really a team,

908
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,590
and that they have your back.

909
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,430
Things are changing for us.

910
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,970
In a few months' time,

911
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,850
you and me are gonna
be outnumbered.

912
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,270
I need...

913
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,270
Just be sure.

914
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,570
Yes, ma'am.

915
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,530
I can feel the difference.

916
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:40,000
U-Gin Genetics Research
Lab Seoul, Korea.

917
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:49,260
Scream, and your
entire staff dies.

918
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,470
I could've killed you,
Helen, the night we met.

919
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:54,680
I didn't.

920
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,350
Do you expect a thank-you note?

921
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:58,230
I expect you to know why.

922
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:00,350
The Cradle.

923
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:02,900
<i>This is the next thing, Tony.</i>

924
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,110
This is the next me.

925
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:08,950
The Regeneration
Cradle prints tissue.

926
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:10,660
It can't build a living body.

927
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:11,820
It can. You can.

928
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,700
You lack the materials.

929
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,450
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

930
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,170
But we all have room to improve.

931
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,030
I didn't realize
you were waiting.

932
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,070
I would've joined you,

933
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:52,530
but it didn't seem
like the right time.

934
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:55,700
They used up all the hot water.

935
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:57,790
I should've joined you.

936
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:59,700
Missed our window.

937
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:01,710
Did we?

938
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:07,130
The world just saw the Hulk.

939
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,880
The real Hulk, for
the first time.

940
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,050
You know I have to leave.

941
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,760
You assume that I have to stay?

942
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,430
I had this dream.

943
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,900
The kind that seems
normal at the time,

944
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:27,900
but when you wake...
What did you dream?

945
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,740
That I was an Avenger.

946
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:36,570
That I was anything more than
the assassin they made me.

947
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:40,160
I think you're being
hard on yourself.

948
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,750
Here I was hoping
that was your job.

949
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:49,250
What are you doing?

950
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,720
I'm running with it.

951
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,640
With you.

952
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,720
If running is the plan,

953
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,600
as far as you want.

954
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:05,270
Are you out of your mind?

955
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,610
I want you to understand that...
Natasha,

956
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:16,070
where can I go?

957
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,370
Where in the world
am I not a threat?

958
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:21,870
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?

959
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,500
Even if I didn't just...

960
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:27,710
There's no future with me.

961
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:32,800
I can't ever... I
can't have this.

962
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,800
Kids.

963
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,680
Do the math. I physically can't.

964
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,850
Neither can I.

965
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,060
In the Red Room where
I was trained...

966
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,020
Where I was raised,

967
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,610
they have a graduation ceremony.

968
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,070
They sterilize you.

969
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,700
It's efficient.

970
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,080
One less thing to worry about.

971
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,460
The one thing that might
matter more than a mission.

972
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,720
Makes everything easier.

973
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,430
Even killing.

974
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:28,520
You still think you're the
only monster on the team?

975
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:36,780
So, we disappear?

976
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,120
Thor didn't say where he
was going for answers?

977
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,660
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.

978
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:52,040
I was kind of hoping Thor
would be the exception.

979
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:53,920
Yeah, give him time.

980
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,170
We don't know what the
Maximoff kid showed him.

981
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:59,760
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

982
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,550
Pulled us apart
like cotton candy.

983
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,220
Seems like you walked
away all right.

984
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:06,810
Is that a problem?

985
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:09,190
I don't trust a guy
without a dark side.

986
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,310
Call me old-fashioned.

987
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,230
Well, let's just say you
haven't seen it yet.

988
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,690
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

989
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:18,950
Well, I guess you'd know.

990
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:20,400
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

991
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,700
Banner and I were
doing research.

992
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:24,080
- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

993
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,330
Isn't that the mission?

994
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:26,870
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

995
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:29,210
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

996
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,840
Every time someone tries to
win a war before it starts,

997
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,670
innocent people die. Every time.

998
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,430
I'm sorry.

999
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:42,470
Mr. Stark...

1000
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,470
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1001
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,100
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

1002
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:49,630
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1003
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,770
Don't take from my pile.

1004
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,200
Hello, Deere.

1005
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,450
Tell me everything.

1006
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,120
What ails you?

1007
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,290
Do me a favor.

1008
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,380
Try not to bring it to life.

1009
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,090
Why, Ms. Barton,
you little minx.

1010
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:23,010
I get it. Maria Hill
called you, right?

1011
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:24,430
Was she ever not
working for you?

1012
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,010
Artificial intelligence.

1013
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:28,810
You never even hesitated.

1014
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,310
Look, it's been a
really long day,

1015
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,060
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1016
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:34,150
so how's about we skip to the
part where you're useful.

1017
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:36,940
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.

1018
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,690
You're not the director of me.

1019
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,610
I'm not the director of anybody.

1020
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,650
I'm just an old man

1021
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,990
who cares very much about you.

1022
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,620
And I'm the man who
killed the Avengers.

1023
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,540
I saw it.

1024
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,210
I didn't tell the team.
How could I?

1025
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,340
I saw them all dead, Nick.
I felt it.

1026
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,210
The whole world, too.

1027
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:00,590
Because of me.

1028
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,550
I wasn't ready.

1029
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,220
I didn't do all I could.

1030
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,350
Maximoff girl, she's
working you, Stark.

1031
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:10,930
Playing on your fear.

1032
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,480
I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1033
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,770
Wasn't a nightmare,
it was my legacy.

1034
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,020
The end of the path
I started us on.

1035
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,030
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

1036
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,110
War isn't one of them.

1037
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:30,200
I watched my friends die.

1038
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,540
You'd think that'd be as
bad as it gets, right?

1039
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,210
Nope.

1040
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,670
It wasn't the worst part.

1041
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,710
The worst part

1042
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,090
is that you didn't.

1043
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,850
I'll see you tonight.

1044
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,510
Royal Holloway
University of London

1045
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,890
I like the look.

1046
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:56,640
If you're going for
inconspicuous, though, near miss.

1047
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:57,940
I need your help.

1048
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,230
It's nice to be needed.

1049
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,730
It's dangerous.

1050
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,400
I'd be disappointed
if it wasn't.

1051
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,820
Ultron took you folks out of
play to buy himself time.

1052
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:12,910
My contacts all say he's
building something.

1053
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:15,540
The amount of vibranium
he made off with,

1054
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,080
I don't think it's
just one thing.

1055
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:18,670
What about Ultron himself?

1056
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:21,250
He's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1057
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:24,050
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

1058
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,470
It still doesn't help us get an
angle on any of his plans, though.

1059
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:28,890
Is he still going
after launch codes?

1060
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:30,300
Yes, he is.

1061
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,930
But he's not making any headway.

1062
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:34,060
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

1063
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,730
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1064
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:37,940
Nexus?

1065
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,940
It's the world
internet hub in Oslo.

1066
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,060
Every byte of data
flows through there.

1067
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:43,190
Fastest access on Earth.

1068
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,400
So, what did they say?

1069
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:46,400
He's fixated on the missiles.

1070
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:48,280
But the codes are
constantly being changed.

1071
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:50,070
By whom?

1072
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,280
Parties unknown.

1073
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,530
Do we have an ally?

1074
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,000
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1075
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,210
Still, I'd pay folding
money to know who it is.

1076
01:12:58,290 --> 01:12:59,500
I might need to visit Oslo.

1077
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,170
Find our unknown.

1078
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:02,670
Well, this is good times, boss,

1079
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,130
but I was kind of
hoping when I saw you,

1080
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:05,420
you'd have more than that.

1081
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,630
I do. I have you.

1082
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:11,640
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.
Ears, everywhere else.

1083
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,970
You kids had all the
tech you could dream up.

1084
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,100
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1085
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:21,690
with nothing but our wit and
our will to save the world.

1086
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:25,480
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

1087
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,150
between him and his mission.

1088
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,320
And whether or not he admits it,

1089
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:32,240
his mission is
global destruction.

1090
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,740
All this, laid in a grave.

1091
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,500
So stand.

1092
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,000
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1093
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,170
Steve doesn't like
that kind of talk.

1094
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,250
You know what, Romanoff?

1095
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,800
So, what does he want?

1096
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:51,260
To become better.

1097
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:52,760
Better than us.

1098
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,430
He keeps building bodies.

1099
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:55,970
Person bodies.

1100
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:57,680
The human form is inefficient.

1101
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:59,980
Biologically speaking,
we're outmoded.

1102
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:02,020
But he keeps coming back to it.

1103
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,270
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race,

1104
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,860
you amazingly failed.

1105
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,980
They don't need to be protected.

1106
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,150
They need to evolve.

1107
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,200
Ultron's going to evolve.

1108
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,370
How?

1109
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,410
Has anyone been in
contact with Helen Cho?

1110
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,750
It's beautiful.

1111
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,170
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells,

1112
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:29,550
they're binding them.

1113
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,520
And S.H.I.E.L.D. never
even thought to...

1114
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,090
The most versatile
substance on the planet,

1115
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:36,720
and they used it
to make a Frisbee.

1116
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,060
Typical of humans.

1117
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:40,730
They scratch the surface
and never think

1118
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,190
to look within.

1119
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,280
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1120
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:59,620
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit the
Nexus. I'll join you as soon as I can.

1121
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,200
If Ultron's really
building a body...

1122
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,290
He'll be more powerful
than any of us.

1123
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:04,420
Maybe all of us.

1124
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,750
An android designed by a robot.

1125
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:08,000
You know, I really miss the days

1126
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:10,380
when the weirdest thing
science ever created was me.

1127
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,510
I'll drop Banner
off at the tower.

1128
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,050
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

1129
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:15,930
She's all yours. Apparently.

1130
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:17,300
What are you gonna do?

1131
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:20,520
I don't know. Something
dramatic, I hope.

1132
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:27,650
I'm gonna finish reflooring that
sunroom as soon as I get back.

1133
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:30,440
Yeah, then you'll find another
part of the house to tear apart.

1134
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:31,690
No.

1135
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,950
It's the last project.

1136
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,450
I promise.

1137
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:56,260
So, this is it.

1138
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,140
The Water of Sight.

1139
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:04,850
In every realm,
there's a reflection.

1140
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,440
If the water's
spirits accept me,

1141
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,480
I can return to my dream

1142
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:11,820
and find what I missed.

1143
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:15,820
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.

1144
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:19,280
A hacker who's
faster than Ultron?

1145
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,450
He could be anywhere,

1146
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:22,370
and as this is the
center of everything,

1147
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,450
NEXUS Internet Hub Oslo, Norway

1148
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:26,910
I'm just a guy looking for a needle
in the world's biggest haystack.

1149
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:29,170
How do you find it?

1150
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:31,920
It's pretty simple.
You bring a magnet.

1151
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:35,170
<i>I'm decrypting nuclear codes.</i>

1152
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,630
<i>And you don't want me to.</i>

1153
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:40,470
Come and get me.

1154
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,690
Wake up!

1155
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:01,700
Thor!

1156
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:03,530
Extinction.

1157
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,220
Cellular cohesion will
take a few hours,

1158
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,760
but we can initiate the
consciousness stream.

1159
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:26,600
We're uploading your
cerebral matrix now.

1160
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,640
I can read him.

1161
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:31,940
He's dreaming.

1162
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:33,900
I wouldn't call it dreams.

1163
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:35,940
It's Ultron's base
consciousness.

1164
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:39,240
Informational noise.
Soon... How soon?

1165
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,740
I'm not being pushy.

1166
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,570
We're imprinting a
physical brain.

1167
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:44,240
There are no shortcuts.

1168
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:45,660
Even if your magic gem...

1169
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,260
How could you?

1170
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:58,840
How could I what?

1171
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:02,260
You said we would
destroy the Avengers,

1172
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:03,470
make a better world.

1173
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:04,800
It will be better.

1174
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,760
When everyone is dead?

1175
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:08,100
That is not...

1176
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:12,900
The human race will have every
opportunity to improve.

1177
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:14,360
And if they don't?

1178
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,020
Ask Noah.

1179
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:18,320
You are a madman.

1180
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,900
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events

1181
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:25,120
before even the
dinosaurs got theirs.

1182
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,370
When the Earth starts to settle,

1183
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:29,790
God throws a stone at it.

1184
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:32,210
And, believe me,
he's winding up.

1185
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,170
We have to evolve.

1186
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,960
There's no room

1187
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:37,880
for the weak.

1188
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,130
And who decides who's weak?

1189
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,720
Life.

1190
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,300
Life always decides.

1191
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,140
There's incoming.

1192
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,890
The Quinjet. We have to move.

1193
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,650
That's not a problem.

1194
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,860
Wait, guys!

1195
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,240
They'll understand.

1196
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,660
When they see,
they'll understand.

1197
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,290
I just need a little more time.

1198
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,840
Two minutes. Stay close.

1199
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,020
Dr. Cho!

1200
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,530
He's uploading himself
into the body.

1201
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:41,690
Where?

1202
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,110
The real power is
inside the Cradle.

1203
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,200
The gem,

1204
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:50,660
its power is uncontainable.

1205
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:53,200
You can't just blow it up.

1206
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,370
You have to get the
Cradle to Stark.

1207
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,460
First, I have to find it.

1208
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:58,840
Go.

1209
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,550
<i>Did you guys copy that?</i>

1210
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:01,670
We did.

1211
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,220
I got a private jet
taking off across town.

1212
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:06,050
No manifest.

1213
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,180
That could be him.

1214
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,680
There. It's a truck
from the lab.

1215
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,060
Right above you, Cap.

1216
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,020
On the loop by the bridge.

1217
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,680
It's them.

1218
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:16,530
You got three with the
Cradle, one in the cab.

1219
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:18,440
I could take out the driver.

1220
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,730
<i>Negative. That truck crashes,</i>

1221
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:21,570
the gem could level the city.

1222
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,240
<i>We need to draw out Ultron.</i>

1223
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,830
No, no, no, no.

1224
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:37,580
Leave me alone!

1225
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:47,930
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

1226
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:49,550
I'm gonna try and
keep him that way.

1227
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,960
You're not a match for him, Cap.

1228
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,220
Thanks, Barton.

1229
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:17,030
You know what's in that cradle?

1230
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:20,170
The power to make real change.

1231
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,710
And that terrifies you.

1232
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:22,950
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

1233
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:27,300
Stop it.

1234
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:40,810
We got a window. Four, three...

1235
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,520
Give him hell.

1236
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,910
I'm always picking
up after you boys.

1237
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:58,200
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.

1238
01:21:58,450 --> 01:21:59,500
<i>Which way?</i>

1239
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:00,750
Hard right.

1240
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:02,790
Now.

1241
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:36,120
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!

1242
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,050
Come on!

1243
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,180
- Clint, can you draw out the guards?
- Let's find out.

1244
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,180
Beep, beep!

1245
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:37,140
They're heading
back towards you.

1246
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:38,740
So whatever you're
gonna do, do it now.

1247
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:47,020
<i>I'm going in. Cap, can
you keep him occupied?</i>

1248
01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:49,320
What do you think
I've been doing?

1249
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:34,860
<i>Okay, package is airborne.</i>

1250
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:36,650
I have a clean shot.

1251
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,450
Negative. I am still
in the truck.

1252
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:39,490
- What the hell are you...
- Just be ready.

1253
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:40,810
I'm sending the package to you.

1254
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,660
How do you want me to take it?

1255
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:44,950
You might wish you
hadn't asked that.

1256
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:59,550
Please, don't do this.

1257
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,680
What choice do we have?

1258
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:10,860
I lost him!

1259
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,400
He's headed your way!

1260
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,360
Nat, we gotta go.

1261
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:32,080
Nat!

1262
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:36,630
Cap, you see Nat?

1263
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:40,220
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!

1264
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:41,550
Do you have eyes on Nat?

1265
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:42,720
<i>Go!</i>

1266
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,720
Damn it.

1267
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,390
Civilians in our path.

1268
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,560
Can you stop this thing?

1269
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:30,310
I'm fine.

1270
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:32,100
I just need to take a minute.

1271
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,480
I'm very tempted not
to give you one.

1272
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,520
The Cradle. Did you get it?

1273
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:38,110
Stark will take care of it.

1274
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:40,530
No, he won't.

1275
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:46,310
You don't know what you're talking about.
Stark's not crazy.

1276
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:48,450
He will do anything
to make things right.

1277
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,750
Stark, come in.

1278
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:56,170
Stark.

1279
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:58,710
Anyone on comms.

1280
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,300
Ultron can't tell the difference

1281
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,760
between saving the world
and destroying it.

1282
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,140
Where do you think he gets that?

1283
01:27:09,310 --> 01:27:10,890
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.

1284
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:13,390
But she's alive, or Ultron would
be rubbing our faces in it.

1285
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,810
This is sealed tight.

1286
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,440
We're gonna need to
access the program,

1287
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,480
break it down from within.

1288
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:22,490
Any chance Natasha might leave you
a message outside the Internet?

1289
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:23,610
Old-school spy stuff?

1290
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:25,820
There are some nets I can cast.

1291
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:27,160
Yeah, I'll find her.

1292
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:31,580
I can work on
tissue degeneration

1293
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:34,960
if you could fry whatever
operational system Cho implanted.

1294
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,130
Yeah, about that.

1295
01:27:40,510 --> 01:27:41,590
No.

1296
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:43,630
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.

1297
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,100
Our ally, the guy protecting
the military's nuclear codes,

1298
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:50,770
I found him.

1299
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:51,970
<i>Hello, Dr. Banner.</i>

1300
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:55,100
Ultron didn't go after
Jarvis because he was angry.

1301
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:59,360
He attacked him because he was
scared of what he can do.

1302
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,150
So Jarvis went underground.

1303
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:03,740
Scattered, dumped his memory.

1304
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,820
But not his protocols.

1305
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,700
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.

1306
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:17,330
So, you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?

1307
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,210
No! Of course not.

1308
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:21,050
I wanna help you put
Jarvis in this thing.

1309
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:25,090
We're out of my field, here.

1310
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:27,220
You know bio-organics
better than anyone.

1311
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:30,430
And you just assume that
Jarvis's operational matrix

1312
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:31,970
can beat Ultron's?

1313
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:35,390
Jarvis has been beating him
from inside without knowing it.

1314
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,520
This is the opportunity.

1315
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,350
We can create
Ultron's perfect self

1316
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,020
without the homicidal glitches he
thinks are his winning personality.

1317
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:43,110
We have to.

1318
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:44,240
<i>I believe it's worth a go.</i>

1319
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:47,820
I'm in a loop!

1320
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:49,030
I'm caught in a time loop.

1321
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:51,030
This is exactly where
it all went wrong.

1322
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,040
I know. I know. I know
what everyone's gonna say.

1323
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,080
But they're already saying it.

1324
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,870
We're mad scientists.

1325
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:00,290
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.

1326
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:02,550
Make a stand.

1327
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,430
It's not a loop.

1328
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,430
It's the end of the line.

1329
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:35,080
I wasn't sure you would wake up.

1330
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,620
I hoped you would. I
wanted to show you.

1331
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:40,460
I don't have anyone else.

1332
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:46,840
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.

1333
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,630
Boom! The end.

1334
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:50,470
Start again.

1335
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:52,510
The world made clean

1336
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,970
for the new man to rebuild.

1337
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:57,480
I was meant to be new.

1338
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,940
I was meant to be beautiful.

1339
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,610
The world would have
looked to the sky

1340
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:04,980
and seen hope,

1341
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,650
seen mercy.

1342
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,530
Instead, they'll
look up in horror

1343
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:11,030
because of you.

1344
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,070
You've wounded me.

1345
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:15,330
I give you full marks for that.

1346
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,910
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...

1347
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,420
...just makes me stronger.

1348
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,710
This framework is
not compatible.

1349
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,550
The genetic coding
tower is at 97%.

1350
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:14,510
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.

1351
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,720
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?

1352
01:31:18,850 --> 01:31:20,890
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.

1353
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:22,140
You don't know
what you're doing.

1354
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:23,640
And you do?

1355
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,020
She's not in your head?

1356
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:26,810
I know you're angry.

1357
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,360
We're way past that.

1358
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,860
I could choke the life out of
you and never change a shade.

1359
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:32,670
Banner, after everything
that's happened...

1360
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,240
It's nothing compared
to what's coming!

1361
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,480
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!

1362
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:41,410
No, no. Go on.

1363
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:43,580
You were saying?

1364
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:51,510
Pietro!

1365
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:53,220
What?

1366
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:55,260
You didn't see that coming?

1367
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,550
I'm rerouting the upload.

1368
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:06,600
Go ahead, piss me off.

1369
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:20,280
Wait!

1370
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,040
I am sorry. That was

1371
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,420
odd.

1372
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:50,920
Thank you.

1373
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,840
Thor.

1374
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,300
You helped create this?

1375
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:00,930
I've had a vision.

1376
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:04,890
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope
of life, and at its center is that.

1377
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:06,890
What? The gem?

1378
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:08,020
It's the Mind Stone.

1379
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,560
It's one of the six
Infinity Stones.

1380
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:11,020
The greatest power
in the universe,

1381
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:13,310
unparalleled in its
destructive capabilities.

1382
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:15,480
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.

1383
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:18,030
It's definitely the end times.

1384
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:19,240
The Avengers cannot
defeat Ultron.

1385
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,660
Not alone.

1386
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:23,120
Why does your Vision
sound like Jarvis?

1387
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,870
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

1388
01:34:26,330 --> 01:34:28,200
to create something new.

1389
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:30,120
I think I've had my fill of new.

1390
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:32,540
You think I'm a child of Ultron.

1391
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,170
You're not?

1392
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:36,920
I'm not Ultron.

1393
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:39,760
I am not Jarvis. I am...

1394
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,260
I am.

1395
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:46,260
I looked in your head

1396
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:48,770
and saw annihilation.

1397
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:49,930
Look again.

1398
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:51,850
Her seal of approval
means jack to me.

1399
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:55,110
Their powers, the horrors in
our heads, Ultron himself,

1400
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,610
they all came from
the Mind Stone.

1401
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:58,940
And they're nothing compared
to what it can unleash.

1402
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:00,570
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?

1403
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:03,240
Are you?

1404
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:05,450
On our side?

1405
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:09,290
I don't think it's that simple.

1406
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:11,910
Well, it better get
real simple real soon.

1407
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,170
I am on the side of life.

1408
01:35:15,330 --> 01:35:16,790
Ultron isn't.

1409
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:18,800
He will end it all.

1410
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,880
What's he waiting for?

1411
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:21,970
- You.
- Where?

1412
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:23,590
Sokovia.

1413
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:24,800
He's got Nat there, too.

1414
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:28,560
If we're wrong about you,

1415
01:35:31,230 --> 01:35:33,230
if you're the monster that
Ultron made you to be...

1416
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:35,350
What will you do?

1417
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,070
I don't want to kill Ultron.

1418
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:47,780
He's unique and he's in pain.

1419
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:52,040
But that pain will
roll over the Earth.

1420
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:54,790
So, he must be destroyed.

1421
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:57,960
Every form he's built, every trace
of his presence on the net.

1422
01:35:58,090 --> 01:35:59,960
We have to act now.

1423
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:04,130
And not one of us can do
it without the others.

1424
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:08,010
Maybe I am a monster.

1425
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,520
I don't think I'd
know if I were one.

1426
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,230
I'm not what you are,

1427
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:16,100
and not what you intended.

1428
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:19,320
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.

1429
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,030
But we need to go.

1430
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:37,000
Right.

1431
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:38,880
Well done.

1432
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:41,590
Three minutes.

1433
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:44,010
Get what you need.

1434
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:00,900
<i>Good evening, boss.</i>

1435
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:07,660
<i>No way we all get through this.</i>

1436
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:09,860
<i>If even one tin soldier is
left standing, we've lost.</i>

1437
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:11,980
There's gonna be
blood on the floor.

1438
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,450
I got no plans tomorrow night.

1439
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:14,820
I get first crack
at the big guy.

1440
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:16,910
Iron Man's the one
he's waiting for.

1441
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:19,420
That's true. He
hates you the most.

1442
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:26,970
Ultron knows we're coming.

1443
01:37:27,090 --> 01:37:29,300
Odds are we'll be
riding into heavy fire.

1444
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,600
And that's what
we signed up for.

1445
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,600
But the people of
Sokovia, they didn't.

1446
01:37:35,470 --> 01:37:37,020
<i>So our priority</i>

1447
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,770
<i>is getting them out.</i>

1448
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:41,860
We're under attack! Clear the city!
Now!

1449
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:51,240
Get off your asses.

1450
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:54,330
<i>All they want is to live
their lives in peace.</i>

1451
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:56,230
<i>And that's not gonna
happen today.</i>

1452
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:59,620
<i>But we can do our
best to protect them.</i>

1453
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:01,920
<i>And we can get the job done.</i>

1454
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:07,510
<i>We find out what
Ultron's been building,</i>

1455
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:10,130
<i>we find Romanoff,</i>

1456
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:12,470
<i>and we clear the field.</i>

1457
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,770
<i>Keep the fight between us.</i>

1458
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,900
Ultron thinks we're monsters.

1459
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,860
That we're what's
wrong with the world.

1460
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:30,320
This isn't just
about beating him.

1461
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,870
It's about whether he's right.

1462
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:40,370
Natasha!

1463
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,500
Natasha!

1464
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:43,750
Bruce?

1465
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,130
You all right?

1466
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,340
Yeah.

1467
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:49,170
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.

1468
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:51,500
I don't suppose you found a
key lying around somewhere.

1469
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,890
Yeah. I did.

1470
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:01,520
So what's our play?

1471
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:03,020
I'm here to get you to safety.

1472
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:04,690
Job's not finished.

1473
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:08,360
We could help with the evacuation, but
I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1474
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:10,860
And you've done plenty.

1475
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,740
Our fight is over.

1476
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,790
So, we just disappear?

1477
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:24,540
Come on.

1478
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:31,420
<i>Your man's in the church, boss.</i>

1479
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:33,380
<i>I think he's waiting for you.</i>

1480
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:39,430
Come to confess your sins?

1481
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:40,890
I don't know. How
much time you got?

1482
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:42,520
More than you.

1483
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:47,690
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?

1484
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:50,070
You're looking... I don't
wanna say "puffy."

1485
01:39:50,230 --> 01:39:51,900
You're stalling to
protect the people.

1486
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:55,280
Well, that is the mission.
Did you forget?

1487
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:57,910
I've moved beyond your mission.
I'm free.

1488
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:03,790
What?

1489
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:07,040
You think you were the
only one stalling?

1490
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,380
<i>There's the rest
of the vibranium.</i>

1491
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,920
<i>Function, still unclear.</i>

1492
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:12,760
This is how you end, Tony.

1493
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:15,260
This is peace in my time.

1494
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:32,990
Go!

1495
01:40:38,490 --> 01:40:39,910
Get off the bridge!

1496
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,120
Run!

1497
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:48,840
Ultron.

1498
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,680
My Vision.

1499
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,090
They really did take
everything from me.

1500
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,350
You set the terms.
You can change them.

1501
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:01,680
All right.

1502
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,080
Friday, the Vision?

1503
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:28,210
<i>Boss, it's working.</i>

1504
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:30,890
<i>He's burning Ultron out of the net.
He won't escape through there.</i>

1505
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,010
You shut me out.

1506
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:38,800
You think I care?

1507
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:41,930
You take away my world,

1508
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:44,720
I take away yours.

1509
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:30,350
Friday.

1510
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:32,900
<i>Sokovia is going for a ride.</i>

1511
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:46,870
Do you see

1512
01:42:47,290 --> 01:42:48,910
the beauty of it?

1513
01:42:49,410 --> 01:42:51,420
The inevitability.

1514
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:54,840
You rise, only to fall.

1515
01:42:57,550 --> 01:43:01,220
<i>You, Avengers, you
are my meteor.</i>

1516
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:03,010
<i>My swift and terrible sword.</i>

1517
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,760
<i>And the earth will crack</i>

1518
01:43:04,890 --> 01:43:06,760
<i>with the weight of your failure.</i>

1519
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:12,270
<i>Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.</i>

1520
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:13,650
<i>It means nothing.</i>

1521
01:43:14,270 --> 01:43:16,020
<i>When the dust settles,</i>

1522
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:18,070
<i>the only thing
living in this world</i>

1523
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:20,110
<i>will be metal.</i>

1524
01:43:24,950 --> 01:43:26,280
We gotta move.

1525
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:27,740
You're not gonna turn green?

1526
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:30,580
I've got a compelling
reason not to lose my cool.

1527
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:31,870
I adore you.

1528
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,050
But I need the other guy.

1529
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,470
Let's finish the job.

1530
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:07,580
I really hope this
makes us even.

1531
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:10,910
Now go be a hero.

1532
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,420
<i>The vibranium core's
got a magnetic field.</i>

1533
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:24,550
<i>That's what's keeping
the rock together.</i>

1534
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:25,680
If it drops?

1535
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,090
<i>Right now, the impact
will kill thousands.</i>

1536
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:29,850
<i>Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.</i>

1537
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:36,350
<i>That building's not clear.
The 10th floor.</i>

1538
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:42,150
Hi.

1539
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,570
Okay.

1540
01:44:44,650 --> 01:44:45,660
Get in the tub!

1541
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,330
<i>I got airborne, heading
up to the bridge.</i>

1542
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:58,380
Cap, you got incoming.

1543
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:00,170
Incoming already came in.

1544
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:05,300
Stark, you worry about bringing
the city back down safely.

1545
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:07,760
<i>The rest of us have one job,</i>

1546
01:45:07,890 --> 01:45:09,140
<i>tear these things apart.</i>

1547
01:45:09,430 --> 01:45:11,100
<i>You get hurt, hurt them back.</i>

1548
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:12,890
<i>You get killed,</i>

1549
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:15,230
walk it off.

1550
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:50,850
Go, go, go!

1551
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,270
How could I let this happen?

1552
01:45:58,440 --> 01:45:59,440
Hey, hey, you okay?

1553
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,560
This is all our fault.

1554
01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:01,610
Hey, look at me.

1555
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:03,980
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.
Who cares?

1556
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:05,570
Are you up for this?

1557
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:06,690
Are you?

1558
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:10,450
Look, I just need to know.
Because the city is flying.

1559
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:14,660
Okay. Look, the city is flying,
we're fighting an army of robots,

1560
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,790
and I have a bow and arrow.

1561
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,000
None of this makes sense.

1562
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:23,340
But I'm going back out
there because it's my job.

1563
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:26,960
Okay? And I can't do
my job and babysit.

1564
01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:30,130
It doesn't matter what you
did or what you were.

1565
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,800
If you go out there, you
fight, and you fight to kill.

1566
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,490
Stay in here, you're good. I'll
send your brother to come find you.

1567
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,430
But if you step out that door,

1568
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:40,350
you are an Avenger.

1569
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:47,030
All right. Good chat.

1570
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:51,820
Yeah, the city is flying.

1571
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:26,940
I got you!

1572
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,570
Just look at me!

1573
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:36,660
<i>You can't save them all.</i>

1574
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,120
You'll never...

1575
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,120
"Never" what?

1576
01:47:41,410 --> 01:47:42,710
You didn't finish!

1577
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,090
What, were you napping?

1578
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:10,570
Thor.

1579
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:14,780
You're bothering me.

1580
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:51,440
All right, we're all clear here.

1581
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,650
We are not clear!

1582
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:54,200
We are very not clear!

1583
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:58,030
All right, coming to you.

1584
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:00,330
Keep up, old man!

1585
01:49:02,830 --> 01:49:04,410
Nobody would know.

1586
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:06,290
Nobody.

1587
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:11,130
"The last I saw him, an
Ultron was sitting on him."

1588
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:13,130
"Yeah, he'll be missed,
that quick little bastard."

1589
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:14,220
"I miss him already."

1590
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:30,940
Hold your fire!

1591
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:41,830
Romanoff!

1592
01:49:42,330 --> 01:49:43,370
Thanks!

1593
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:54,420
<i>The anti-gravs are
rigged to flip.</i>

1594
01:49:54,510 --> 01:49:56,720
<i>Touch them, they'll go
full reverse thrust.</i>

1595
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,260
<i>The city's not coming down slow.</i>

1596
01:49:58,340 --> 01:49:59,390
Spire is vibranium.

1597
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:00,850
If I get Thor to hit it...

1598
01:50:00,930 --> 01:50:02,390
<i>It will crack.
That's not enough.</i>

1599
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:04,020
<i>The impact would still
be devastating.</i>

1600
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:05,430
Maybe if we can cap
the other end.

1601
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:07,350
Keep the atomic
action doubling back.

1602
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:08,770
<i>That could vaporize the city.</i>

1603
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:11,690
<i>And everyone on it.</i>

1604
01:50:17,490 --> 01:50:19,360
The next wave is gonna
hit any minute.

1605
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:21,370
- What do you got, Stark?
<i>- Nothing great.</i>

1606
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:24,540
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1607
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:25,950
That'll keep it from
impacting the surface,

1608
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:27,120
if you guys can get clear.

1609
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:29,170
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.

1610
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:32,380
<i>Impact radius is getting
bigger every second.</i>

1611
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:33,880
<i>We're gonna have
to make a choice.</i>

1612
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:36,210
Cap, these people
are going nowhere.

1613
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,420
If Stark finds a way
to blow this rock...

1614
01:50:38,510 --> 01:50:39,510
Not till everyone's safe.

1615
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:43,260
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.

1616
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:45,180
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.

1617
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:46,810
I didn't say we should leave.

1618
01:50:49,730 --> 01:50:51,600
There's worse ways to go.

1619
01:50:56,980 --> 01:50:59,490
Where else am I gonna
get a view like this?

1620
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,910
<i>Glad you like the
view, Romanoff.</i>

1621
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:04,580
<i>It's about to get better.</i>

1622
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:29,930
<i>Nice, right?</i>

1623
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:32,600
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.

1624
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:34,270
She's dusty, but she'll do.

1625
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:36,110
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1626
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:38,610
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

1627
01:51:38,730 --> 01:51:40,990
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1628
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:42,610
Lifeboats secure to deploy.

1629
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:45,410
Disengage in three, two...

1630
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:47,580
Take them out.

1631
01:51:57,210 --> 01:51:58,840
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1632
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:01,380
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.

1633
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:04,430
This is not so bad.

1634
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,020
Let's load them up.

1635
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:18,320
Sir, we have multiple bogies
converging on our starboard flank.

1636
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:19,820
Show 'em what we got.

1637
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:21,240
You're up.

1638
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:27,490
Yes!

1639
01:52:27,660 --> 01:52:29,450
Now this is gonna
be a good story.

1640
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:34,170
Yup. If you live to tell it.

1641
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:36,380
You think I can't hold my own?

1642
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:38,020
We get through this,
I'll hold your own.

1643
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:40,050
You had to make it weird.

1644
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:47,850
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.

1645
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:06,200
Here we go. Here we go.
Let's move.

1646
01:53:06,570 --> 01:53:07,570
Let's go, everyone!

1647
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,160
Number six boat is
topped and locked...

1648
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,660
Or stocked... Topped...

1649
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:16,580
It's full of people.

1650
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:19,420
Incoming!

1651
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:23,550
Oh, God!

1652
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:35,270
<i>You think you're saving anyone?</i>

1653
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:39,440
I turn that key and drop
this rock a little early

1654
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:41,400
and it's still billions dead.

1655
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:42,940
Even you can't stop that.

1656
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:45,700
I am Thor, son of Odin,

1657
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:47,990
and as long as there is
life in my breast...

1658
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:50,580
I am running out
of things to say!

1659
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:51,660
Are you ready?

1660
01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:00,460
It's terribly well-balanced.

1661
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:04,340
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...

1662
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:07,970
I got it. Create a heat seal.

1663
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:09,340
I could...

1664
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:11,850
I could supercharge
the spire from below.

1665
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,220
<i>Running numbers.</i>

1666
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:25,280
<i>A heat seal could work
with enough power.</i>

1667
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:27,360
- Thor, I got a plan.
<i>- We're out of time.</i>

1668
01:54:27,490 --> 01:54:28,820
<i>They're coming for the core.</i>

1669
01:54:28,910 --> 01:54:30,780
Rhodey, get the rest of the
people on board that carrier.

1670
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:31,820
On it.

1671
01:54:31,910 --> 01:54:34,120
Avengers, time to
work for a living.

1672
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:44,460
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

1673
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:46,960
Romanoff.

1674
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:49,630
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."

1675
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:50,680
<i>Relax, shellhead.</i>

1676
01:54:51,010 --> 01:54:52,550
Not all of us can fly.

1677
01:54:58,230 --> 01:54:59,980
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

1678
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:02,270
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.

1679
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:08,820
Is that the best you can do?

1680
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:20,250
You had to ask.

1681
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:22,790
This is the best I can do.

1682
01:55:22,830 --> 01:55:24,500
This is exactly what I wanted.

1683
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:28,010
All of you against all of me.

1684
01:55:28,170 --> 01:55:30,380
How can you possibly
hope to stop me?

1685
01:55:31,180 --> 01:55:33,140
Well, like the old man said...

1686
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:35,470
Together.

1687
01:57:04,390 --> 01:57:06,810
You know, with the
benefit of hindsight...

1688
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:17,110
They'll try to leave the city.

1689
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:18,910
We can't let them, not even one.
Rhodey.

1690
01:57:19,330 --> 01:57:20,330
I'm on it.

1691
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:22,120
No. I didn't say
you could leave.

1692
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:24,870
War Machine coming at you!
Right...

1693
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:32,630
Okay, what?

1694
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,880
We gotta move out. Even I can
tell the air is getting thin.

1695
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:36,300
You guys get to the boats.

1696
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:38,220
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.

1697
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:39,720
What about the core?

1698
01:57:39,890 --> 01:57:40,890
I'll protect it.

1699
01:57:42,810 --> 01:57:43,810
It's my job.

1700
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:46,020
Nat.

1701
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:47,400
This way.

1702
01:57:51,770 --> 01:57:53,070
Get the people on the boats.

1703
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:54,150
I'm not going to leave you here.

1704
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:55,360
I can handle this.

1705
01:57:57,610 --> 01:57:58,910
Come back for me when
everyone else is off.

1706
01:57:59,030 --> 01:58:00,200
Not before.

1707
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:02,330
You understand?

1708
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:05,040
You know, I'm 12 minutes
older than you.

1709
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:06,540
Go.

1710
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:09,670
<i>Boss, power levels
are way below...</i>

1711
01:58:09,710 --> 01:58:11,920
Reroute everything. We
get one shot at this.

1712
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,130
I know what I need to do.

1713
01:58:18,430 --> 01:58:19,510
The dining room.

1714
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,010
If I knock out that east wall,

1715
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:23,320
it'd make a nice workspace
for Laura, huh?

1716
01:58:24,770 --> 01:58:26,020
Put up some baffling.

1717
01:58:26,060 --> 01:58:28,190
She can't hear the kids running around.
What do you think?

1718
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:29,560
You guys always eat in
the kitchen anyway.

1719
01:58:29,650 --> 01:58:31,230
No one eats in a dining room.

1720
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:38,020
We don't have a lot of time.

1721
01:58:38,530 --> 01:58:40,570
So get your ass on a boat.

1722
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:54,670
Hey, big guy.

1723
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:58,170
Sun's getting real low.

1724
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:01,390
You're safe now. You're gonna be okay.
Buckle up.

1725
01:59:03,890 --> 01:59:05,520
Secure your gear, find a seat.

1726
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:06,890
Costel!

1727
01:59:07,890 --> 01:59:09,140
We were in the market.

1728
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:10,310
Costel!

1729
01:59:24,910 --> 01:59:26,950
Thor, I'm gonna need you
back in the church.

1730
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:28,580
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1731
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,000
Everyone else is on the carrier.

1732
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,250
<i>You know, this works,</i>

1733
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:33,250
we maybe don't walk away.

1734
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:35,040
Maybe not.

1735
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:57,780
<i>I got no strings, so I have fun.</i>

1736
01:59:58,190 --> 02:00:00,990
<i>I'm not tied up to anyone.</i>

1737
02:00:02,450 --> 02:00:03,820
Come on. Time to go.

1738
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:38,360
You didn't see that coming?

1739
02:01:34,540 --> 02:01:36,370
For God's sake.

1740
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:54,430
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!

1741
02:02:06,820 --> 02:02:07,860
No, no, I'm fine.

1742
02:02:07,990 --> 02:02:09,070
Fine.

1743
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:12,990
It's been a long day.

1744
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:28,760
Wanda.

1745
02:02:29,430 --> 02:02:32,720
If you stay here, you'll die.

1746
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:35,680
I just did.

1747
02:02:36,430 --> 02:02:38,140
Do you know how it felt?

1748
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:54,580
It felt like that.

1749
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:31,240
Thor, on my mark.

1750
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:47,340
Now!

1751
02:04:15,370 --> 02:04:17,740
<i>Hey, big guy. We did it.</i>

1752
02:04:18,790 --> 02:04:20,450
<i>The job is finished.</i>

1753
02:04:20,710 --> 02:04:23,370
<i>Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?</i>

1754
02:04:27,630 --> 02:04:29,460
We can't track you
in stealth mode.

1755
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:33,800
<i>So help me out. I need you...</i>

1756
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:20,470
You're afraid.

1757
02:05:21,390 --> 02:05:22,430
Of you?

1758
02:05:23,140 --> 02:05:24,390
Of death.

1759
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:26,900
You're the last one.

1760
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:29,610
You were supposed
to be the last.

1761
02:05:29,770 --> 02:05:32,110
Stark asked for a savior

1762
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:34,780
and settled for a slave.

1763
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:37,370
I suppose we are both
disappointments.

1764
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:40,950
I suppose we are.

1765
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:42,870
Humans are odd.

1766
02:05:44,710 --> 02:05:48,420
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites

1767
02:05:50,090 --> 02:05:51,460
and try to control
what won't be.

1768
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:55,630
But there is grace
in their failings.

1769
02:05:55,970 --> 02:05:57,930
I think you missed that.

1770
02:05:58,510 --> 02:05:59,680
They're doomed.

1771
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:01,640
Yes.

1772
02:06:05,770 --> 02:06:08,770
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.

1773
02:06:10,770 --> 02:06:12,860
It's a privilege
to be among them.

1774
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:15,610
You're unbearably naive.

1775
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:17,110
Well...

1776
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:21,240
I was born yesterday.

1777
02:07:11,330 --> 02:07:15,380
New Avengers Facility
Upstate New York.

1778
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:34,820
<i>Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!</i>

1779
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:38,320
Fat.

1780
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:40,720
One of our tech
boys flagged this.

1781
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:43,950
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1782
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:46,620
Could be the Quinjet.

1783
02:07:46,990 --> 02:07:50,410
But with Stark's stealth tech, we
still can't track the damn thing.

1784
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:53,330
Right.

1785
02:07:53,710 --> 02:07:55,960
Probably jumped out
and swam to Fiji.

1786
02:07:57,260 --> 02:07:59,170
He'll send a postcard.

1787
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:01,180
"Wish you were here."

1788
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:06,310
You sent me to recruit
him way back when.

1789
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:10,770
Did you know then what
was gonna happen?

1790
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:14,940
You never know.

1791
02:08:15,110 --> 02:08:18,610
You hope for the best, then
make do with what you get.

1792
02:08:19,070 --> 02:08:20,490
I got a great team.

1793
02:08:21,650 --> 02:08:23,660
Nothing lasts forever.

1794
02:08:23,950 --> 02:08:26,030
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

1795
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:29,540
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.

1796
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:34,710
<i>The rules have changed.</i>

1797
02:08:34,830 --> 02:08:36,420
We're dealing with
something new.

1798
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:37,960
The Vision is artificial
intelligence.

1799
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,010
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?

1800
02:08:40,090 --> 02:08:41,890
No, it's not like a person
lifting the hammer.

1801
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:43,930
Right, different rules for us.

1802
02:08:43,970 --> 02:08:45,010
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.

1803
02:08:45,140 --> 02:08:48,100
He can wield the hammer, he
can keep the Mind Stone.

1804
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:51,270
It's safe with the Vision.

1805
02:08:51,430 --> 02:08:53,980
And these days, safe
is in short supply.

1806
02:08:55,980 --> 02:08:57,980
But if you put the
hammer in an elevator...

1807
02:08:58,110 --> 02:08:59,910
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

1808
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:01,860
I'm gonna miss these
little talks of ours.

1809
02:09:01,940 --> 02:09:03,610
Not if you don't leave.

1810
02:09:03,650 --> 02:09:05,530
I have no choice.

1811
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:07,870
The Mind Stone is the fourth
of the Infinity Stones

1812
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:09,370
to show up in the
last few years.

1813
02:09:09,490 --> 02:09:11,120
It's not a coincidence.

1814
02:09:11,870 --> 02:09:13,710
Someone has been playing
an intricate game

1815
02:09:13,790 --> 02:09:15,500
and has made pawns of us.

1816
02:09:15,540 --> 02:09:17,420
And once all these pieces
are in position...

1817
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:19,050
Triple Yahtzee.

1818
02:09:19,170 --> 02:09:20,630
You think you can find
out what's coming?

1819
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:21,840
I do.

1820
02:09:22,590 --> 02:09:24,180
Besides this one,

1821
02:09:24,260 --> 02:09:26,590
there's nothing that
can't be explained.

1822
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:36,480
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.

1823
02:09:39,610 --> 02:09:42,320
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.

1824
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:44,110
There's gonna be a
lot of manful tears.

1825
02:09:46,110 --> 02:09:47,870
I will miss you, Tony.

1826
02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:49,030
Yeah?

1827
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:51,740
Well, it's time for
me to tap out.

1828
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:54,080
Maybe I should take a page
out of Barton's book.

1829
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:57,170
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.

1830
02:09:57,790 --> 02:09:59,040
The simple life.

1831
02:09:59,210 --> 02:10:00,550
You'll get there one day.

1832
02:10:00,590 --> 02:10:01,590
I don't know.

1833
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:04,300
Family, stability...

1834
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:08,590
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.

1835
02:10:10,010 --> 02:10:11,890
I think someone else came out.

1836
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:16,940
You all right?

1837
02:10:19,610 --> 02:10:21,070
I'm home.

1838
02:10:28,950 --> 02:10:31,740
You wanna keep staring at the
wall, or do you wanna go to work?

1839
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:33,290
I mean, it's a pretty
interesting wall.

1840
02:10:33,370 --> 02:10:36,460
I thought you and Tony were still
gazing into each other's eyes.

1841
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:37,540
How do we look?

1842
02:10:37,750 --> 02:10:40,080
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

1843
02:10:40,170 --> 02:10:41,960
We got some hitters.

1844
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:44,550
They're good.
They're not a team.

1845
02:10:44,590 --> 02:10:46,220
Let's beat them into shape.

1846
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:06,320
Avengers...

1847
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:26,580
Fine.
