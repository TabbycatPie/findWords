17
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,770
My name is Barry Allen,

18
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,070
and I am the fastest man alive.

19
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,510
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

20
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,100
But secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

21
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,010
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

22
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,380
But when my daughter came back from the future to help,

23
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,950
she changed the present...

24
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,340
and now our world is more dangerous than ever.

25
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,980
And I'm the only one fast enough to save it.

26
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,280
I am the Flash.

27
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,630
Previously on "The Flash"...

28
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,710
You threw yourself off a building to save Dad?

29
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,220
Yeah.

30
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,190
We all know the sound of Cicada's breathing.

31
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,530
His lungs are injured.

32
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,590
We can't keep doing this. It's not healing.

33
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,990
Killer Frost has been gone

34
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,260
since the night the DeVoe took over your body.

35
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,020
Is she gone for good?

36
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,290
I've tried everything I can think of

37
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,230
to get her to reappear.

38
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,200
My father told me to come find him.

40
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,460
My dad's been dead for years.

41
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,780
He knew that there were two of you.

42
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,920
He knew the truth about Killer Frost.

43
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,780
- We've got eyes and ears! - I knew you could do it.

45
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,630
There's only one sure place somebody could hide.

46
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,740
A Tannhauser black ops site.

47
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,510
Vanilla latte and a Medium Zoom for Raelene.

48
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,240
Thank you.

49
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,320
Should've left me alone.

50
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,350
And you never should have existed.

53
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,920
We are back in business.

54
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,040
And by business, he means

55
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,080
the better-than-Sally the satellite business.

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,440
And what does that mean?

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,930
That means we're getting closer to

58
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,530
identifying the ever-elusive Cicada.

59
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,570
It's Cicada, Sherloque.

60
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,950
Once I hacked DeVoe's satellites,

61
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,790
all I had to do was just use an impact extrapolation algorithm

62
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,240
to predict where the shrapnel would've fallen

65
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,460
on Sally the satellite.

66
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,670
May God rest her soul.

67
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,700
So now we got 46 locations

68
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,850
where 46 pieces of shrapnel landed.

69
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,920
And once of these locations is

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,600
where Cicada will have been injured.

71
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,230
Except we don't know which one.

72
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,260
Or maybe we do.

73
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,380
You see, after my hands got sliced by Cicada's dagger,

74
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,120
Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, here

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,130
measured the dark matter in my system.

76
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,250
And its levels of concentration were higher

77
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,760
than any I'd ever seen before.

78
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,310
Insanely high, and the only part of the satellite

79
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,770
that would have dark matter levels that high--

80
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,260
Is the core, which is where Cicada's dagger came from.

81
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,990
So we find the location of the core

82
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,640
and we'll know where Cicada was that night.

83
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,870
You know, FEMA set up sites

84
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,190
to help people after the Enlightenment.

85
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,250
If Cicada was injured,

86
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,120
maybe he received medical treatment at one of them.

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,040
That's a great idea.

88
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,810
I mean, we could check with FEMA

89
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,610
to see if any fathers matching Cicada's description

90
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,430
reported any injuries near the crash site.

91
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,820
So, we split up.

92
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,300
Okay, great. I'm good at tracking things down.

93
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,460
So I will try and find the satellite core.

94
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,560
I will come with you and everybody else look for the names.

95
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,890
Um, do you mind if I actually come with you too?

96
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,200
It's just that I saw you jump off a building last week

97
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,470
and that was awesome.

98
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,000
So I thought maybe I'd come with you

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
while you did some detective work.

100
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,560
Oh, I think that two people is going to be

101
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,350
more than enough for what we need--

102
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,210
What he's trying to say

103
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,540
is that we would love to have you come with us.

104
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,610
Okay.

105
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,350
All right, well, why don't I talk to FEMA

106
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,290
and see if I can get some names.

107
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,800
Hey, I know Joe's been itching to get out of the house,

108
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,120
and it might help to have an actual badge.

109
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,060
Nobody does case snacks like Joe West.

110
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,070
I'll swing by on the way.

111
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,080
All right, cool.

112
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,090
So, Snow Patrol, what's going on?

113
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,680
You tell me.

114
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,070
I'm guessing it's not a coincidence

115
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,000
that we're left here with nothing to do

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,560
for the next few hours.

117
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,460
I know we were supposed to wait until you were ready

118
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,970
to locate your dad.

119
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,670
But I had the satellites track down

120
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,150
all the decommissioned Tannhauser black ops sites

121
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,950
that your dad could possibly be in.

122
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,870
Okay.

123
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,050
And-- and then I hacked into their security systems.

124
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,630
He was the last person to enter one of them.

125
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,270
A week after he died.

126
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,870
And he never left.

127
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,130
Where is he?

128
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,040
It's open. Come in.

129
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,560
Hey! Cecile.

130
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,620
Is-- is Joe here?

131
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,580
Uh, no. He's out with Jenna.

132
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,210
Oh, dang. Okay. Bummer.

133
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,780
All right, I'll go get some falafel and come back in a bit.

134
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,180
Wait, no. Please don't--

135
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,360
leave me here. Um, what did you need?

136
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,200
Maybe I can help you.

137
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,130
Oh, I need somebody to flash a badge

138
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,450
and generally look intimidating, so.

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,570
You don't think that I can be intimidating.

140
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,210
Oh, my God, you don't, do you?

141
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,570
Ralph, I am the district attorney.

142
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,080
You know I psychically teleported the Flash

143
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,940
inside the Thinker's mind

144
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,110
whilst giving birth to my daughter,

145
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,010
sans epidural-- it hurt!

146
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,180
I literally saved the world between contractions,

147
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,460
and you don't think that I am intimidating?

148
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm really intimidated right now, actually.

149
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,490
You are very intimidating.

150
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,580
Okay, what are we doing?

151
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,260
Uh, we are getting a list of FEMA recipients treated

152
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,480
after the Enlightenment

153
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,550
to hopefully find cicada's real name.

154
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,990
FEMA, come on. I worked with them a ton.

155
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,480
I know that org inside and out.

156
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,870
Just, uh--oh, give me five. I gotta go pump first.

157
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,040
What are we pumping?

159
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,180
Coordinates are set for the North Pole.

161
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,580
Thank you guys for coming with me.

162
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,560
Ready when you are.

163
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,340
Okay.

164
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,160
Here we go.

165
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,090
Can't see anything!

166
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,560
My face just went full Weeknd!

167
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,210
Wait, I think I see something.

168
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,370
Over here!

169
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,670
What?

170
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,500
I think it's a building.

171
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,640
Is there a door?

172
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,180
We don't need one.

173
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,640
Hello? Anybody here?

174
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,130
There.

175
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,040
You okay?

176
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,890
When my father entered this facility nearly 20 years ago,

177
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,920
he had severe ALS.

178
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,410
Maybe the reason he never left is 'cause he couldn't.

179
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,360
Look, whatever we find in here,

180
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,440
we'll be right here with you.

181
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,270
It smells like science in here.

182
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,940
What kind of research does your mom's lab do, exactly?

183
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,660
I honestly don't even know anymore.

184
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,520
Caity?

185
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,940
Dad? Is that you?

186
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,380
Is this really happening?

187
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,620
You're alive.

188
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,770
Are you-- you're real?

189
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,120
Yeah, Dad, it's me. I'm real. I'm real.

190
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,170
You found me.

191
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,030
You got my message.

192
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,240
I did in the periodic table we made together.

193
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,360
It took me 20 years to find it, but it led me to you.

194
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,710
I knew you would come.

195
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,420
Thank you.

196
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,820
I thank all of you.

197
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,740
Dad, these are my friends. This is--

198
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,640
Uh, Barry Allen and Cisco Ramon. I know.

199
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,940
Um, sorry. How do you know us?

200
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,400
Well, when I first came here,

201
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,290
I stayed in contact with scientists.

202
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,620
Louise Lincoln, Victor Fries,

203
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,520
and Harrison Wells.

204
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,110
Dr. Wells was able to give me full access to, uh,

205
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,510
S.T.A.R. Labs video uplink.

206
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,160
Wait a minute.

207
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,490
You've-- you've had video link to S.T.A.R. Labs

208
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,410
this entire time?

209
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,270
Oh, no. God no. I mean, it hasn't worked until recently.

210
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,060
And unfortunately, since it rebooted,

211
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,050
its capabilities is only as a one-way video,

212
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,180
so I could see you but I couldn't reach you.

213
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,350
Well, it looks like you had plenty of toys around here

214
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,460
to keep you company.

215
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,710
This neat little incubator.

216
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,800
What's it for?

217
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,360
Well, that was here when I got here.

218
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,860
Never had any use for that thing.

219
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,930
I don't understand. Why are you here?

220
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,930
I mean, how are you still even alive?

221
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,320
ALS is a horrible disease,

222
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,000
and I grew desperate,

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,330
and I began experimenting with therapies using cryogenics.

224
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,980
Something went wrong?

225
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,640
Yes.

226
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,890
The, uh, experiments became more and more dangerous.

227
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,590
and I quarantined myself for the sake of everyone's safety.

228
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,180
I did manage to freeze the progression of that disease.

229
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,760
Not before the site was entirely closed out,

230
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,630
and I have been here ever since.

231
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,880
They shut down this site while you were still in it

232
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,260
and locked you in.

233
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,800
It was my mother, wasn't it?

234
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,320
She's the only one with an authority to shut down

235
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,490
a Tannhauser site.

236
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,060
Listen, your mother thought it would be easier

237
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,570
for you not to see me.

238
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,880
But I always had the faith that I could cure this thing.

239
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,970
That's why I sent you the note.

240
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,600
So how--how did you survive here this whole time?

241
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,470
Water. Rations.

242
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,710
Spending months at a time in that cryogenic chamber.

243
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,170
Well, you don't ever have to do that again,

244
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,580
because we can get you out of here.

245
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,990
We're gonna give you your life back.

246
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,070
Shouldn't this place be packed to the rafters?

247
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,990
I mean, we had a citywide disaster not long ago.

248
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,210
Don't worry. I got this.

249
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,350
It's time to put the war face on.

250
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,030
Hey, buddy, pull them out.

251
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,610
Lose the music.

252
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,810
Hi, I'm DA Cecile Horton.

253
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,020
This is my associate, Ralph Dibny.

254
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,150
DA?

255
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,480
How can I help you?

256
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,090
You the field director here?

257
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,810
Assistant. You got a claim or something I can help you with?

258
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,680
We're trying to ID a suspect in a criminal investigation

259
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,100
and we're going to need to take a look at the names of

260
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,710
all the people you've assisted in the last six months.

261
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,210
I can't give you anyone's names.

262
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,500
You'll need to get a warrant for that.

263
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,150
Listen up, mister!

264
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,660
Bagger Vance!

265
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,420
It's Vance Brandon.

266
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,710
You listen to me when I tell you

267
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,370
that this is my town, baby.

268
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,990
Oh, yeah, and I can make some real

269
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,860
bad stuff happen for you.

270
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,640
Like, really, really no bueno.

271
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,310
Yeah, well, this is my country,

272
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,820
which is a lot bigger than your town.

273
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,390
- That's true. - So, until you get a warrant,

274
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,070
you're not getting anything.

275
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,890
But wait, did you--Bagger? Bagger Va--did you--

276
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,650
But this my war face.

277
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,490
I put my war face on.

278
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,600
That was my war face, Ralph.

279
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,500
It's okay, I--I think you're just--

280
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,260
you're--you're a little rusty, that's all.

281
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,080
Oh, no. That was way more

282
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,800
than a little rust, Ralph.

283
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,660
I've lost my mojo.

284
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,810
Oh, that was a... new mode of travel.

285
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,940
That is what we call an interdimensional

286
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,210
space-time breach.

287
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,850
It takes a little while to get used to it.

288
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,850
So, this is S.T.A.R. Labs, IRL.

289
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,630
Look at that view.

290
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,830
I want to run some tests.

291
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,150
Make sure everything is all right with you.

292
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,250
This city is so beautiful.

293
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,830
The sunsets here.

294
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,670
I used to think about them all the time.

295
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,640
Hey, maybe you guys should just

296
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,990
go for a walk or something.

297
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,600
Try and reconnect first.

298
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,530
Yeah.

299
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,090
Um, why don't we go for a walk?

300
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,750
Get some fresh air.

301
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,410
I can run my tests later.

302
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,250
I love that plan.

303
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,060
What's up with you?

304
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,390
Dude, this story is full of holes.

305
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,650
I'm just trying to fill them.

306
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,560
Nora's story had holes in them,

307
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,910
and she was only lying to me 'cause she wanted to meet me.

308
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,750
I've appreciated every second that we've had together so far.

309
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,620
Caitlin just got her dad back.

310
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,020
Let's be happy for her.

311
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,900
Hey, I'm happy.

312
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,080
So what are we doing first?

313
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,250
Uh, well, you're a speedster.

314
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,070
So I was thinking you could run around the site.

315
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,720
See if you can find the core.

316
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,890
I thought, since it's our first time teaming up,

317
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,760
maybe I could go with you and we can interview the people

318
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,110
who were here the night of the Enlightenment together.

319
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,920
- Or no. - No, no, no.

320
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,320
Yeah, it's just--

321
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,690
normally, I interview people by myself.

322
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,320
Oh, oh, my God. No, no. It's fine.

323
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,600
It's--I wouldn't ask you to come speed around the city

324
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,100
with me or anything like that.

325
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,710
- It's fine. - Okay, well, I'll--

326
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,330
- No, no, no. You come with me- - I'll come with you, okay.

327
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,410
And we'll interview the foreman.

328
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,970
All right, let's not. How about that?

329
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,480
Look, we have 45 more sites to search.

330
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,870
Clearly we don't have the time and clearly we must split up.

331
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,170
So you go search for the core and you go talk to the foreman.

332
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,890
I will look for clues.

333
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,480
And this is how investigations collapse.

334
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,160
Hey, babe.

335
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,210
No, the mother-daughter team-up is kinda off to a rocky start.

336
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,810
But I don't know, I think we'll get there.

337
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,060
So?

338
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,960
The core's not here.

339
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,220
Why don't you go search the other sites?

340
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,670
We'll finish up here.

341
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,740
Well, no, you don't want to do that, do you, no?

342
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,550
Because, um, you're not here to investigate, are you?

343
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,650
No, you're here to spend time with your mother, right?

344
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,470
Well, I just thought maybe we would find something

345
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,910
in common if we worked on a case together.

346
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,100
But she's really good at prying information out of people.

347
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,670
Believe me, and...

348
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,500
I'm fast on my feet.

349
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,190
I'm gonna go back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

350
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,390
Hold on, wait.

351
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,310
I have another plan to try and find this core.

352
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,230
It involves you and your mother.

353
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,310
So, uh, cherry soda. Popcorn.

354
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,650
I haven't had a cup of Jitters coffee in quite a while.

355
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,180
But the thing that I miss the most was--

356
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,570
Peanut butter and jelly waffles.

357
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,420
Yeah, Mom used to hate it when you made those.

358
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,310
Yeah, well, your mom always wanted

359
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,810
the nicer things in life, I guess,

360
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,850
and I was happy with simple.

361
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,630
It's a wonder you two ever got together.

362
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,960
- How is she? - The same.

363
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,950
I don't really see her that often,

364
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,700
and when I do, she's cold as ice.

365
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,800
And now, after what she did to you--

366
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,290
Oh, well, look, she may be a little bit chilly,

367
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,600
 but she does love you, Caity.

368
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,380
It's been really hard without you.

369
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,720
I mean, just me and her. It was tough.

370
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,820
- Yeah. - I've been through a lot.

371
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,840
A lot of that has to do with me.

372
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,550
No.

373
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,420
No, no, listen, and--and I wasn't there for you.

374
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,770
All these years-- they went by and I--

375
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,350
I want to make it up to you, Caity.

376
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,930
I mean, I really should've been there for you, right?

377
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,190
I mean--and I wish that I could just--

378
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,810
Dad? Oh, my God.

379
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,060
Dad. Here, sit.

380
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,900
Oh, my God. Dad?

381
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,510
Dad, Dad.

382
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,550
Caity?

383
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,700
Dad? I'm right here.

384
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,670
You saw my disease?

385
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,640
Yeah, uh... the dermis is crystallizing.

386
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,660
And it's spreading.

387
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,420
I ran some tests while you were unconscious.

388
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,630
You have a cryogenic malignancy

389
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,760
and a somatic mutation.

390
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,100
It's not contagious but--

391
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,220
It's rewriting my genetic code.

392
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,900
And if it continues, you could--

393
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,960
Die.

394
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,440
Well, I cured my ALS,

395
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,770
but I created something even more deadly.

396
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,430
Every time my emotions spike, my malignancy spreads.

397
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,800
Like when you're angry or scared?

398
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,920
I wish I had just left well enough alone.

399
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,160
For both of us.

400
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,040
Wait, did I have the genetic marker for ALS too

401
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,670
and you tried to cure me?

402
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,170
So my powers came from you?

403
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,220
Killer Frost is my cure?

404
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,430
Killer Frost?

405
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,220
You may know her by a different name.

406
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,340
Khione.

407
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,660
Dad, what did you do to me?

408
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,940
I wasn't gonna let the ALS manifest in you

409
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,060
like it did in me.

410
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,180
So you used experimental cryogenic gene therapy

411
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,560
on your own daughter?

412
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,510
I had already done it on myself.

413
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,680
Caity, I made alterations to the treatment.

414
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,570
I tried to make it safer, Caity,

415
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,040
and you started to exhibit dual personality

416
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,180
soon after I treated you.

417
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:30,000
So is, um, Khione or Killer Frost--

418
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
is she still around?

419
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,420
No, she--she's been gone for a little while,

420
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,290
but she's still a part of me.

421
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,580
So where's your dual personality?

422
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,540
You and Caitlin carry the same markers,

423
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,390
you took the same cure.

424
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,290
Where your Khione?

425
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,360
I never had one.

426
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,900
That's probably why...

427
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,040
I'm dying and you're not.

428
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,120
Okay, what if we use my cells to create a serum

429
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,510
to stabilize your body?

430
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,770
Um, we have to stop your atoms from oscillating.

431
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,670
So get your body to a temperature of absolute zero.

432
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,020
Caitlin, that could kill him.

433
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,930
My cells can theoretically

434
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,240
withstand subzero temperatures

435
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,470
because of my cryogenic gene therapy.

436
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,520
But the problem is getting to absolute zero.

437
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,770
We could use a laser cooling array.

438
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,340
The DOD just constructed one at their site outside of town.

439
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,770
- I could check it out. - Okay, great.

440
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,080
I'll get started on the serum.

441
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,980
No, no, wait. Hold on.

442
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,600
We--we can't just hack into

443
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,500
the DOD's $5 billion security system.

444
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,560
Cisco.

445
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,640
I just got my dad back. I can't let him die.

446
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,770
I'll see what I can do.

447
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,030
It's the fifth person to be sliced up this week.

448
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,840
Take him to OR Three.

449
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,060
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

450
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,500
- I'm fine. - I need to stitch that up.

451
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,780
You've got abrasions, possible internal injuries.

452
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,820
You keep going out there,

453
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,350
you're gonna be back here in a body bag.

454
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,390
You can't be a part of this.

455
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,630
Do you know how many patients I've seen

456
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,370
come in this hospital the past four years

457
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,100
because of those metas out there?

458
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,420
I just treated a man who was attacked by

459
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,980
a human razor blade, and you wanna say

460
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm not a part of this?

461
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,650
Oh, I got that razor meta.

462
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,830
Just like I'll get the rest of them.

463
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,510
I know why you're doing this.

464
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,030
And I know that little girl laying in a coma

465
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,550
is not my family, but you are not the only one

466
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,490
whose heart breaks every day she doesn't wake up.

467
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,360
Grace is the one that needs help. Not me.

468
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,340
Now, are you gonna get out of my way, Doc?

469
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,260
Or are you gonna call security?

470
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,740
What the heck happened back there?

471
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,970
I froze up.

472
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,660
Look.

473
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,480
When I got canned from CCPD,

474
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,850
I fell in with some legally questionable individuals.

475
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,570
These are some scary, scary people,

476
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,520
but they all had one thing in common.

477
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,160
They were all terrified of Ce-Seal-Your-Fate Horton .

478
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,490
And I don't believe for one second that

479
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,230
that woman has gone anywhere.

480
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,690
Don't ever call me that again.

481
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,470
I'm sorry. Geez. I thought I--I thought we were bonding

482
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,420
and having a moment, but I think I crossed the line.

483
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,580
I didn't really mean to--

484
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,620
I'm kidding. It's a joke. I was joking.

485
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,510
My gosh, I really got you.

486
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,860
You didn't have to get so nervous about it.

487
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,410
Nervous. Like the FEMA guy did.

488
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,490
Ralph, I don't think I froze up back there.

489
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,470
Right. Right, you're-- you're an Empath now.

490
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,430
Your powers let you experience his fear.

493
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,910
I have no idea who that is, but if he got that scared

494
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,880
when we asked him about the victims list--

495
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,170
It's because he's hiding something.

496
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,040
Yes.

497
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,030
What's, uh, what's happening with your nose right now?

498
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,900
Oh, when I smell a mystery, that's my thing. I do that.

499
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,600
- That's nasty. - It is? You don't--

500
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,120
- Please stop. - You don't like it?

501
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,980
C'est l'aviron qui nous m¨¨ne, qui nous m¨¨ne

502
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:35,220
 C'est l'aviron qui nous m¨¨ne en haut

503
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,310
C'est l'aviron qui nous m¨¨ne, qui nous m¨¨ne

504
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,700
C'est l'aviron qui nous m¨¨ne en haut

505
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,260
He has been singing that same song for the last two hours.

506
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,120
I know, I know.

507
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,820
Are you seriously making tea right now?

508
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,990
Le th¨¦. Oui. Right, chamomile.

509
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,170
You know, to stimulate the brain, but also, frankly,

510
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,470
the digestive system.

511
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,690
Right, because since I've arrived at here,

512
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,610
I've been backed up like a traffic jam.

513
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,910
That is so disgusting. Beyond disgusting.

514
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,520
How are we supposed to investigate

515
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,640
when you're making tea, Sherloque?

516
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,700
Well, you seem very annoyed, mademoiselle.

517
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,930
- No shrap, Sherlock. - Sherloque.

518
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,790
Sorry for the language, Mom.

519
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,180
It's okay.

520
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,130
Hey, look.

521
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,700
There was a carnival the night the satellite crashed.

522
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,580
If my dad is right about Cicada being a father, then maybe--

523
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,030
He might've brought his kid here.

524
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,720
Exactly.

525
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,320
But, I mean, I ran all over this place.

526
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,650
There's no core in sight.

527
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,040
 C'est l'aviron qui nous m¨¨ne, qui nous m¨¨ne

528
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,710
What if...

529
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,960
The core fell into the water.

530
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,450
How you will retrieve it?

531
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,490
Nora, why don't you create a vortex like your dad did

532
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,690
when he fought King Shark?

533
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,580
Oh, no, or what if we do what you did with the Hotness?

534
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,760
You know about that?

535
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,840
Yeah, of course. I made Papa Joe tell me everything about

536
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,730
when my mom was a speedster.

537
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,990
So how do we do it?

538
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,440
Well, you just, um--you run back and forth in a--

539
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,900
in a really tight formation.

540
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,120
And you want to pull the water up with your heels.

541
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,270
Okay, right, which will drive the water away from the shore.

542
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,180
Exactly.

543
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,640
-Schway. -Yeah.

544
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,530
Do you think I can do it?

545
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,410
Yeah, Nora, you got this.

546
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,320
Okay.

547
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,030
Four satellites?

548
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,010
Give them to Cisco. He's got 'em.

549
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,370
DOD sites? There you go. All in a day's work for him.

550
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,820
You all think I can just hack anything, huh?

551
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,090
Yeah.

552
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,340
I can hack anything.

553
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,620
There you are.

554
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,050
Found a path into the DOD base.

555
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,810
As long as Cisco can shut down the interior alarms, it'll work.

556
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,300
Awesome. I just need to balance this serum

557
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,700
and we should be good to go.

558
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,280
Thank you for this, Caity.

559
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,660
I mean, what you're doing is beyond the call.

560
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,390
Of course, you're my dad.

561
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,030
I'd do anything for you.

562
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,630
He's not your dad.

563
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,000
Look familiar?

564
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,600
Cisco. What are you talking about?

565
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,660
This is my father.

566
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,370
I went back to the Tannhauser black ops site,

567
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,030
and I picked up a vibe.

568
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,830
I saw him working in the lab--

569
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,240
Cisco, your vibes have been a little problematic--

570
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,250
I know what I saw. I saw him standing over the incubator,

571
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,710
the one he claimed he had no use for,

572
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,310
and he was working on this.

573
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:08,050
Skin grafts? What does this have to do with anything?

574
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,570
This is gonna sound whacked-out,

575
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,400
but what if, when you dad tried to cure his ALS,

576
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,790
it didn't just give him crystallized skin?

577
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:20,350
What if it really did create that dual personality?

578
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,410
-This Killer Frost? - That's who you think this is?

579
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,020
Thomas' alter ego wearing a copy of his face

580
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,340
made out of these skin grafts?

581
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,960
Yes, I know. I know it-it sounds--

582
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,460
It sounds absurd,

583
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,130
but I can see where Mr. Ramon is getting his hypothesis.

584
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:41,430
My, uh, cryo-malignancy spread further than I admitted,

585
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:46,310
and it's afflicted my face, my hands, my arms, my chest.

586
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,860
And I created those skin grafts from stem cells

587
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,310
that I found in the lab in order to cover any further outbreaks.

588
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,540
You're lying to us.

589
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,130
- Cisco-- - Caitlyn, you have to see--

590
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,150
No, you need to leave us alone.

591
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,470
- Please-- - Now!

592
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,470
I got it.

593
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,230
Dude. Hey dude, we need to talk.

594
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,060
Why? I thought that dramatic confrontation worked perfectly.

595
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,830
- We all want to help Caitlin. - Oh, do you?

596
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,960
Yeah, I want Caitlin to have a chance to be with her father.

597
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,290
Just like Nora got the chance to be with you?

598
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,660
See, this is your problem.

599
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,250
You think that this is just another perfect

600
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,710
father-daughter pairing, reunited.

601
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,410
I'm not blinded by my feelings.

602
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,120
Well, they're not helping you see any clearer.

603
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,160
You gotta stop thinking about this like Nora's dad

604
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,450
and start thinking about it like a CSI.

605
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,430
Please?

606
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,380
Don't do it for me. Do it for her.

607
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,480
Didn't I tell you to get lost?

608
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,460
Yes, you did. Thanks for that.

609
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,200
Gave us time to pull your file.

610
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,030
You don't have any priors,

611
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:00,590
but I did find about a dozen outstanding parking tickets, though.

612
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,490
Oh, no.

613
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,520
For, uh, what was it? It was, um--

614
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,840
Oh, yeah, a Lamborghini.

615
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,860
Hmm. Vroom, vroom.

616
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,250
How does a civil servant afford a $200,000 car?

617
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,820
Okay, I'm calling security.

618
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,610
Please do.

619
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,980
I can't wait to report a case of insurance fraud.

620
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,180
You've been telling citizens their claims have been denied

621
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,780
and then pocketing the cash for yourself

622
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,150
when the government pays up.

623
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,530
That's why this FEMA center's emptier than Grandma's whiskey

624
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,080
at a Dibny Christmas dinner.

625
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,800
You can't prove any of this.

626
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,170
Try me.

627
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,120
That's everyone.

628
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,150
Names, addresses, location the night of the crash.

629
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,140
So... this is gonna stay between us?

630
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,880
You've been profiting off of innocent victims.

631
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,300
You know I put a call into your superiors in D.C. 20 minutes ago.

632
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,930
I got my groove back, Vancey.

633
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,660
That's how I know it's you that's scared and not me.

634
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,100
Now there's the old Ce-Seal-Your-Fate Horton

635
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,250
we all know and love.

636
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,170
If you came to defend Cisco, please don't bother.

637
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,860
He just cares about you.

638
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,990
Come on, don't you think I wouldn't know

639
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,810
if that wasn't actually my father?

640
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,540
You too? Really?

641
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,180
Listen, I wanted to believe that that's your dad

642
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,680
and that he's a good guy because I want you to be happy.

643
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,950
But I don't--I don't know.

644
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,840
Maybe I haven't been seeing clearly.

645
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,490
There is a lot about this guy's story that doesn't add up.

646
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,270
This guy? This guy is my father.

647
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,480
He's the man who held me when I had chickenpox.

648
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,240
Who told me I could be anything I wanted to

649
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,160
and made me believe it.

650
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,840
So please stop treating him like he's a criminal.

651
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,790
Okay.

652
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,670
You know how estranged I am from my mother

653
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,910
and how empty I felt without Killer Frost.

654
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,170
He is the only family that I have left.

655
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,010
But Caitlin, that's not true. We're your family too.

656
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,030
And we're only asking you to keep an open mind

657
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,070
because we care about you.

658
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,760
Especially Cisco.

659
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,200
If it'll make you feel better,

660
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,560
you can ask him your questions,

661
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,170
but only after I give him the serum.

662
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,740
- What's wrong? - Oh, my God.

663
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,760
What?

664
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,490
If I give this serum to a human,

665
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,980
it will suppress their malignant side.

666
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,340
But if I give it to a cryogenic meta-human,

667
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,040
it will permanently suppress their human side.

668
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,650
If that's your father's alter ego--

669
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,270
He's trying to wipe out my dad.

670
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,600
He needed your cells to make the serum.

671
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,800
"Caitlin, come find me."

672
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,040
Caity.

673
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,570
What's going on?

674
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,420
Dad, why?

675
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,380
Well... I guess, as you're all here...

676
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,000
You have such smart friends, Caity.

677
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,620
That frozen liquid in your lungs

678
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,680
is gonna be turning into tiny icicles.

679
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,630
Making it very difficult for you to breathe.

680
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,560
But no worries.

681
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,350
You'll pass out soon.

682
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,340
Caitlin. Hey! Caitlin, wake up.

683
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,240
- Hey, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

684
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,840
Um, is my dad gone?

685
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,260
He took the serum.

686
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,850
This is all my fault.

687
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,260
I was so excited to have my dad back

688
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,040
that I--I couldn't see who he really was.

689
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,890
I owe you both an apology.

690
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,800
Hey, it's okay.

691
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,370
We'll get him.

692
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,780
Hey, guys, get in here.

693
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,750
Come on.

694
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,500
Eyes, please.

695
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,910
- What? - He's at the DOD site. Look.

696
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,260
That building's 7 below?

697
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,810
Look at the temperature. Look at it drop.

698
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,880
He initiated the negative array

699
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,880
but didn't seal it.

700
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,290
The room is -7, but the array is -100.

701
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,230
That thing's so freaking cold,

702
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,160
it's freezing the whole building.

703
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,720
Wait, at this rate, in 5 minutes,

704
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,760
the temperature will be -460 degrees,

705
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,910
AKA absolute zero.

706
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,150
At which point, he can inject himself with my serum.

707
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,360
And turn himself into a full-on icicle.

708
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,400
Icicle, that's-- not the time.

709
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,590
- We gotta go. - Let's do it.

710
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,170
Hey, what-- what about your hands?

711
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,300
You're my friend, my family. I'm going.

712
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,070
Almost there.

713
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,840
Flash.

714
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,430
Don't you realize that speed and cold don't mix?

715
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,810
This machine is capable of producing isotopes

716
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,240
that can freeze carbon dioxide.

717
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,070
You can't run in here.

718
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,810
More superheroes to freeze.

719
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,640
The array's at -220. You have one minute.

720
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,880
You people are not as smart as I thought.

721
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,990
Guys, what's happening?

722
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,110
The temperature in the room is dropping.

723
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,940
Everyone's so cold, their atoms are hitting near stasis.

724
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,380
Why--why can't I see my breath?

725
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,010
It's too cold. There's no moisture in the air.

726
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,520
Cisco, are you okay?

727
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,560
No. At least I can't feel anything.

728
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,610
Guys, the array's at -350 degrees.

729
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,560
He's gonna be able to go full icicle soon.

730
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,690
Come on.

731
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,150
- Forty-five seconds. - What do we do?

732
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,290
Lightning.

733
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,460
Use your lightning to counter the cold

734
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,370
and maybe you can warm up enough to stop him.

735
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,920
We've been trying to do it this whole time.

736
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,040
It's too cold.

737
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,410
I'm literally fr--freezing.

738
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,150
-399, you have 30 seconds.

739
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,470
Your temperature is dropping too quickly.

740
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,070
You're gonna go into hypothermic shock soon.

741
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,320
But not Caitlin.

742
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,100
Look, Caitlin's body temperature is normal.

743
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,910
Caitlin, you must be immune.

744
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,370
But Killer Frost is gone.

745
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,570
Well, clearly, she's not.

746
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,190
Guys, 400 degrees. We got 20 seconds.

747
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,740
Caitlin, you can do it.

748
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,730
Just concentrate.

749
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,210
Dad!

750
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,270
Please, I know you're in there.

751
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,750
Don't do this.

752
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,960
Do you think Thomas can hear you, Caity?

753
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,780
Thomas hasn't been able to hear anything

754
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,710
for a very long time.

755
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,280
- What is that? - 460 degrees. We're too late.

756
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,570
He beat us.

757
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,990
No!

758
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,350
My daughter. You've returned!

759
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,340
You're not my family.

760
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,300
They are.

761
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,160
You only gave a damn about me because you wanted that serum.

762
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,370
But I--I can share it with you.

763
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,510
Just imagine.

764
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,030
The two of us, free to be ourselves without fear.

765
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,740
You are strong.

766
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,180
We can be even stronger together.

767
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,300
I'm strong because I have people in my life

768
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,290
who actually care about me.

769
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,430
Do you?

770
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,850
No!

771
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,940
No!

772
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,330
Caity?

773
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,900
- Dad? - You found me?

774
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,990
Temperature's rising.

775
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,590
What's happening? Is everyone okay?

776
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,520
- I think so. - A little help?

777
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,700
Get Cisco.

778
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,070
Oh, yeah. That's good.

779
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,060
Yeah.

780
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,470
Okay.

781
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,790
My dad.

782
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,600
Our dad.

783
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,100
He was here, but... I lost him.

784
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,750
We'll get him back. Together.

785
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,360
You're not alone anymore.

786
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,330
Neither am I.

787
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,610
No cold signature in the area.

788
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,730
Snow Country for Old Men must be miles away,

789
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,640
'cause he sure as hell isn't in Central City.

790
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,610
Well, we have to find him.

791
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,240
I mean, Icicle wouldn't have gone through all this trouble

792
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,840
to kill my Dad if there wasn't a piece of him still left.

793
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,060
We'll find him.

794
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,880
All the things I vibed, they weren't memories of your dad.

795
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,920
They were of his alter ego.

796
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,580
My dad was trying to protect me.

797
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:13,290
You know what? My mom probably was too.

798
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,490
I mean, she was just trying to keep me safe.

799
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,020
All this time, I thought she was the villain.

800
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,020
How could I not see it was him?

801
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,050
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

802
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,450
Thawne. Zolomon.

803
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,750
We see the good in people. That's just who we are.

804
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,540
I hope that never changes.

805
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,220
There's something else you guys should see.

806
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,930
All this time, we've been trying to figure out

807
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,890
how Killer Frost disappeared,

808
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,440
but we've been looking at it all wrong.

809
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,990
We've been thinking DeVoe used Melting Point's powers,

810
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,940
that he changed your meta DNA

811
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,540
and removed Killer Frost from you.

812
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,740
But tonight, you proved that she's still a part of you.

813
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,810
So what caused her to leave?

814
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,800
DeVoe used a different set of powers.

815
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,990
- Brainstorm. - Brainstorm.

816
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,320
All they did was create a mental block.

817
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,250
One you broke through tonight, so you can do that again.

818
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,100
You just gotta learn how.

819
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:12,320
I think it's time we reintroduce an old friend.

820
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,810
Harry's mental activity dampener.

821
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,670
It'll help me hear her.

822
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,130
That's right.

823
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,570
It's my hope that the more you use it,

824
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,320
the more you connect with her.

825
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,950
Eventually, you won't need it anymore.

826
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,560
Thank you.

827
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,950
Guys, we need you in the Speed Lab.

828
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,360
All right. We'll leave you to it.

829
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,060
Hey, stranger.

830
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,240
Hey.

831
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,250
Well, we sure have a lot to talk about.

832
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,330
Oh! Sally's heart!

833
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,550
You brought it back.

834
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,130
We did, thanks to these two

835
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,220
and their deductive abilities.

836
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,820
And our tidal-wave-breaking skills. Right?

837
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,240
Like mother, like daughter.

838
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,610
Uh, is it safe for this to be here?

839
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,890
Yeah, a little dark matter never hurt anybody.

840
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,900
What?

841
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,430
We've seen this puzzle piece before.

842
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:26,260
Our satellite giveth, and now we must taketh away.

843
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,890
I think we can finally do that.

844
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,810
We got a list from FEMA of everyone who reported injuries

845
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,970
the night of the Enlightenment.

846
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,640
None of them matched Cicada's description.

847
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,700
But there were three kids

848
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,980
who were hit by pieces of shrapnel from the satellite.

849
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,150
Two of them are twins whose father is deceased.

850
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,730
Third is a ten-year-old girl,

851
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,440
by the name of Grace Gibbons.

852
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,130
So if my dad's right and Cicada's a father, then...

853
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,340
We may have just found his daughter.

854
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,350
Orlin?

855
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,670
Orlin.

856
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,220
After I fix up your side, I'm gonna patch up your chest.

857
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,360
No.

858
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,470
It's making me stronger.
