18
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,450
Good morning.

19
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,220
That's your third ding.

20
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,220
Good morning. It's Carly.

21
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,780
She has arrived at her pathology conference.

22
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,660
Shaun, you need to text her back.

23
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,810
Her text wasn't a question. It doesn't require a response.

24
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,800
True. But it sucks to be left hanging.

25
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,920
You didn't like how it felt

26
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,830
when you thought Carly was ignoring you.

27
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,300
I have received your message.

28
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,920
Sent.

29
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,340
You made me breakfast?

30
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,650
Oh, God, no. I ordered breakfast.

31
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,600
But I managed to keep it warm.

32
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,330
You don't have to do this. I'm fine.

33
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,660
Did you get any sleep?

34
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,680
I got enough.

35
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,380
Her death's not your fault.

36
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,270
She knew the risks.

37
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,610
She made a choice to save her baby.

38
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,050
I bet she'd make the same choice again,

39
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,370
even knowing how it would end.

40
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,600
Thank you.

41
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,270
Thanks for breakfast.

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,130
We do a complete enucleation of the right eye,

43
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,360
then replace it with the temporary implant,

44
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,100
and in a few weeks, you'll --

45
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,960
You know why blind people don't skydive?

46
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,050
It scares the hell out of the dog.

47
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,690
Let the doctors finish. Okay, bud?

48
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,290
Yeah, cancer eye out. Fake eye in.

49
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,970
Just like last time. I got it.

50
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,040
Check it out.

51
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,920
It even moves and everything.

52
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,400
You can't even tell it's fake.

53
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,890
Very cool. Like a bionic superhero.

54
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,790
Yeah, and my superpower is tripping over stuff.

55
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,050
What time is the surgery?

56
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,310
3 o'clock.

57
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,100
Which means I've got six hours left

58
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,990
to blast some aliens.

If anyone utters the word "Bubble Girl,"

63
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,420
I will transfer to a different hospital.

66
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,200
When you were his age, would you have faced going blind

67
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,430
with h-humor, maturity, and acceptance?

68
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,110
I would have burned things down.

69
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,080
He's dealing with it in his own way.

70
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,950
We'll check in with him

71
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,030
while you're taking care of the rest of the paperwork.

72
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,470
Make sure Charlie knows there's people he can talk to.

73
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,760
- Thank you. - Thank you.

74
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,200
Dr. Reznick, take Charlie's blood to the lab.

75
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,790
Dr. Browne, talk to him.

76
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,300
Maybe he'll open up to you.

77
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,660
Heart sounds are normal. No sign of pericardial effusion.

78
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,560
You are the oldest SCID-patient I am aware of.

79
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,440
People with your condition usually die very young.

80
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,690
Yay. I win.

81
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,160
Tara, imaging confirms

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,510
that you have infected tissue on your right lung

83
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,280
that's what's causing your breathing issues.

84
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,320
And we're gonna remove it

85
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,030
with a procedure called decortication...

86
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,000
And you'll use the thoracoscopic approach

87
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,910
to decrease risk of infection.

88
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,410
And I'll be in an enclosed chamber in the O.R. What else?

89
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,520
I assure you, we'll be taking every precaution

90
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,710
to keep you safe.

91
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,850
Dr. Melendez, this building is a glorified incubator

92
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,870
for every infection on the planet.

93
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,030
Considering I don't come with an immune system,

94
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,280
I don't need assurances.

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,770
I need you to tell me how you're gonna not kill me.

96
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,250
We will administer a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

97
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,980
You will be transported to the O.R. under a respiratory hood.

98
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,730
The room will be equipped with laminar air flow

99
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,910
and kept at a positive pressure of 8 Pascals.

100
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,670
Surgical instruments will be double-sterilized

101
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,680
and all blood products will be irradiated.

102
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,240
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

103
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,770
Visitors will also have to go through

104
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,050
a strict decontamination --

105
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,290
There won't be any.

106
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,830
The less time I spend with people, the better.

107
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,370
Are we done?

108
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,160
How'd your talk with Charlie go?

109
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,040
He wants to be left alone.

110
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,830
- No, you want to be left alone. - And yet here we are.

111
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,540
Precocious pre-teen going blind.

112
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,880
Come on, that's Claire catnip. You have to talk to him.

113
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,020
- Did he have any tests scheduled? - No.

114
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,140
No one's seen him, heard him, smelled him.

115
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,130
I'm calling Security.

116
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,170
- Hold on. - What are you doing?

117
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,640
Where's Charlie?

118
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,870
Did something happen? Is he okay?

119
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,000
He's in imaging.

120
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,370
We'll have him back very soon.

121
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,500
He ordered a ride 15 minutes ago.

122
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,980
- To where? - It's close.

123
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,710
We could have him back before anyone knows he's gone.

124
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,480
- Are you insane? - You're right.

125
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,000
It's much better if we go back in there

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,960
and freak out two already-freaked-out parents,

127
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,510
and while you're at it, explain to Andrews

128
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,210
that you didn't do what he asked you to do.

129
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,530
Which emoji was it?

130
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,790
Just send it to me.

131
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,850
You told me I have to respond.

132
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,520
There is no response to...

133
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,040
Okay, I think Carly's saying she misses you

134
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,060
and wants to know that you miss her, too.

135
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,850
You know all of that from one fake face?

136
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,090
Just text her back something flirty, casual.

137
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,780
Say something like, "I can't stop thinking about you."

138
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,950
I have stopped thinking about her many times today.

139
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,590
Do not text Carly that.

140
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,570
I have to go.

142
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,060
Okay.

143
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,860
This popcorn is terrible.

144
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,120
We have to get you back

145
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,100
before your parents start to worry.

146
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,240
We're gonna be three years, five months too late.

147
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,190
The game is a blowout. So, we leave now

148
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,410
What's her name?

149
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,290
What?

150
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,620
I dunno.

151
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,460
The only words I've ever said to her are,

152
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,670
"Can I have a slushy?"

153
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,630
I just wanted to see her one last time.

154
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,670
- Go say hi. - Are you crazy?

155
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,550
I was asking her that earlier.

156
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,550
Tell her you think she's the most beautiful girl

157
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,710
you've ever laid eyes on,

158
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,090
and with your last few hours of sight,

159
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,110
you wanted to see her face one more time.

160
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,930
- As lovely as this is... - Don't ruin the moment.

161
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,790
The necrotic debris has completely encased

162
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,870
the visceral pleura.

163
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,870
Follow me with the camera. I don't want to spring a leak.

164
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,420
Tissue's fused her lungs to her chest wall.

165
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,810
I need the Kaiser Forceps.

166
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,570
Damn it. Tissue's too thick to fit through the ports.

167
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,260
We need to do a thoracotomy.

168
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,210
And we can't open her up in an air-tight chamber.

169
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,370
If we have to cauterize a bleed,

170
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,880
the whole thing could explode.

171
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,530
We have to take our Bubble Girl out of the bubble.

172
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,930
- We've been gone too long. - Calm down.

173
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,750
It'll take the kid 15 seconds to chicken out.

174
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,200
Or less.

175
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,950
I'm a wuss.

176
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,220
Most kids wouldn't have gone over at all. Good for you.

177
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,870
- Can I... - No.

178
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:03,880
- I'm just -- - No.

179
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,970
- It better be fast. - What?

180
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,650
We're giving a sad, nearly blind kid

181
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,140
a few more minutes in the sun.

182
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,630
We could get an award for this.

183
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,440
Change gloves every 20 minutes.

184
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,820
We need to be fast, but extremely careful.

185
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,170
Knife.

186
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,200
It's a Northern flying squirrel.

187
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,260
They don't fly so much as glide.

188
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,730
You're lucky it's not infected.

189
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,690
Well, it's a fascinating species.

190
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,090
They're uncommonly high-strung for a nocturnal rodent.

191
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,990
Is the squirrel in the bag?

192
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,700
Yes.

193
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,940
- Henry comes everywhere -- - No, no, no, no, no.

194
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,970
That's okay. I don't need to see him.

195
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,290
Okay.

196
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,620
Has he bitten you before?

197
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,580
It was my fault. I provoke him.

198
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,380
Henry's a good boy.

199
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,620
It's not your fault.

200
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,290
You can't take him from me.

201
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,540
He's not allowed to hurt you.

202
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,140
- It's 12:47. - Thank you.

203
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,810
You're 17 minutes late for your 12:30 --

204
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,580
Mrs. Pryce and I need to have a little talk.

205
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,120
It's okay. Henry and I are fine.

206
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,890
Who's Henry?

207
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,880
You hesitated before cutting her open.

208
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
We had to work fast once I made the incision.

209
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,530
I was running through the procedure in my head.

210
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,220
There's no shame in needing to process a tough loss.

211
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,440
You should talk to someone.

212
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,090
I'd prefer to focus on my current patient

213
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,530
rather than my last one.

214
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,770
Dr. Browne, where's my patient?

215
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,930
And before you say, "Imaging,"

216
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,290
I already know that's not true.

217
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,010
He's with me and Morgan.

218
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,780
He just needed to process a few things. Everything's --

219
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,650
Watch out!

220
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,970
What's going on?

221
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,760
Morgan just missed a turn. She's a terrible driver.

222
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,750
Uh, no, we're on our way back now.

223
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,180
- Hurry. - Okay.

224
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,250
How long was I out in the open?

225
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,860
13 minutes.

226
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,040
We got all of the infected tissue.

227
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,690
That's annoying.

228
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,650
It was necessary to save your life.

229
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,050
No, I meant your phone.

230
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,510
Oh. It is.

231
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,300
I bet it's your girlfriend.

232
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,230
How did you know?

233
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,280
Only annoying girlfriends text that much.

234
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,700
I used to text my boyfriend all the time.

235
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,780
It annoyed him, too.

236
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,590
I am supposed to flirt with her,

237
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,510
and I don't know how.

238
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,730
Did your boyfriend break up with you

239
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,090
because you were annoying?

240
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,450
No. He died.

241
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,770
That's the downside of outliving your prognosis.

242
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,430
You outlive everyone else's too.

243
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,570
That is a downside?

244
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,410
Get out your phone.

245
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,350
I'll tell you what to type.

246
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,720
I'm really good at phone sex.

247
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,040
It's the only kind of sex I can have.

248
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,840
We haven't had sex.

249
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,550
I'll stick to foreplay.

250
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,720
No, thank you.

251
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,510
Do you text your parents? Or are they dead too?

252
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,790
My parents are in Denver.

253
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,340
My dad's job transferred them there.

254
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,320
They always wanted to live near the snow.

255
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,640
They're outdoorsy, and I'm, you know, not.

256
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,420
I am not close to my parents either.

257
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,670
I have autism, and they don't.

258
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,090
I need to listen to your lungs.

259
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,730
I just got really dizzy.

260
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,490
What's going on?

261
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,700
You have an infection.

262
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,330
Temperature is 103.6. BP is 80/50.

263
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,210
She's showing early signs of sepsis.

264
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,410
Start her on a course of IV immunoglobulin therapy,

265
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,980
ADA-enzyme

266
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,050
replacement and GM-CSF.

267
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,040
Okay.

268
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,250
I think we can do more than treat her infection...

269
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,760
Gene replacement therapy.

270
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,660
We harvest her stem cells and use a retroviral vector

271
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,460
to transduce her DNA with the modified ADA gene.

272
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,380
If it works, she's cured.

273
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,790
And if it doesn't work, she dies.

274
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,010
There's a 50% chance

275
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,700
her body will have an acute toxic reaction.

276
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,010
We're going to treat the infection.

277
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,840
She'll get another infection. And another, and another,

278
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,070
and eventually, one of them will kill her.

279
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,870
You don't know that. She's already beaten the odds.

280
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,670
By cutting herself off from the world.

281
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,920
Traditional treatment is the safer course.

282
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,860
He's blowing off steam.

283
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,360
He's with the doctors. He's safe.

284
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,950
He's scared and overwhelmed,

285
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,080
and obviously he felt like he couldn't tell us --

286
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,710
Because you've been keeping him under lock and key.

287
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,160
I'm protecting him.

288
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,200
We have to stay strong.

289
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,320
I think Charlie knows you're strong.

290
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,020
And he knows you love him.

291
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,830
But the moment you all heard the word "Cancer,"

292
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,410
everything in Charlie's life changed.

293
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,820
And I think he needs to know that, at some point,

294
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,920
it's going to start to feel like his life again.

295
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,360
My mom and dad used to do these things called

296
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,850
spontaneous family adventure days...

297
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,180
SFADs.

298
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,320
They were pretty lame. But they let me skip school.

299
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,160
Got to go to baseball games,

300
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,680
drive around with blaring music.

301
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,910
I got to eat food that was inorganic

302
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,760
and genetically modified.

303
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,820
Sometimes I even got to stay up past midnight.

304
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,170
Now we go to doctor's appointments.

305
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,570
And my mom makes lists. And cries.

306
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,680
And my dad's...quiet.

307
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,650
Just one more quick stop.

308
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,600
Morgan, Andrews is expecting us to --

309
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,080
Please, just 20 more minutes.

310
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,050
15.

311
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,360
Park told me you rejected his gene therapy idea.

312
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,330
We can't dismiss plausible treatment options out of fear.

313
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,810
It's not fear.

314
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,350
It's a reasonable degree of caution.

315
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,550
Since when are you cautious?

316
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,420
The benefit of the cure may be worth the risk.

317
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,650
Let Park take it to her.

318
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,820
No. It's not worth it.

319
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,900
The cure is riskier in the short term,

320
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,760
but the long-term upside is much greater.

321
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,690
We can give you the chance

322
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,440
to live a long, healthy, normal life.

323
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,760
No, you can't.

324
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,400
I've been a freak my whole life.

325
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,020
And curing my disease,

326
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,950
letting me take a breath of fresh air,

327
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,890
it's not gonna make me normal.

328
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,720
Increase the oxygen to 15 liters.

329
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,280
Start her on the IVIG.

330
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,810
We need to let her rest.

331
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,650
I'm a freak, too.

332
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,080
People have called me that

333
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,600
because I am not neurotypical.

334
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,870
And I used to be alone,

335
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,470
like you.

336
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,390
Sometimes that was easier.

337
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,280
Because it is hard to be around people

338
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,190
when you're not like them.

339
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,790
But now I have Dr. Glassman,

340
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,160
and a roommate who is a girl,

341
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,120
and a girlfriend who is only annoying some of the time.

342
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,070
And I think it is better than being alone.

343
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,690
If you're...cured,

344
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,740
you can be..."outdoorsy"

345
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,410
like your parents.

346
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,780
Or you can stay inside and have phone sex.

347
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,940
It will be your choice.

348
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,410
The next time you go over my head will be the last.

349
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,830
Prep her for the gene replacement.

350
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,870
Nice work, Shaun.

351
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,260
No. No way.

352
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,730
He's going blind.

353
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,240
It's his last chance to see a naked woman.

354
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,500
You're a woman.

355
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,920
I bet under those clothes, you're a naked one.

356
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,120
I'm his sister.

357
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,980
I'll slip you 50 bucks.

359
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,810
My budget proposal, for your approval.

361
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,650
Surgical cases, for your review.

362
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,540
Before the board meeting tomorrow night.

364
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,810
The pregnant woman...?

365
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,950
How's Neil taking it?

366
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,600
Five minutes, please. I'm with Dr. Lim.

367
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,440
I see there's a new member on the clinic team.

368
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,070
How's that going?

369
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,990
Well, it's been half-a-day. We're working out the kinks.

370
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,130
Well, if it's still smooth-sailing by close of business,

371
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,580
let me know your secret.

372
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,950
I guess that answers my initial question.

373
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,620
He keeps telling me he's fine.

374
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,170
You're the last person he'd tell if he weren't.

375
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,000
I'd be the second to last.

376
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,510
I'm almost done.

377
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,260
You're the President.

378
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,680
He has to listen when you talk. Or, pretend to.

379
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,240
Hey, the four-year-old with the ear infection

380
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,500
has been here half an hour,

381
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,210
his mother just pulled out fingerpaints.

382
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,320
You need to go. 

383
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,490
Debbie, this is Dr. Lim, Chief of Surgery.

384
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,200
I know. It's very impressive.

385
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,120
Come back if you get an ear infection.

386
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,290
- One more. - No.

387
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,080
We're done.

388
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,980
The surgery can't start without me.

389
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,420
Where are we going next?

390
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,850
Yosemite? The Great Wall? The top of Everest?

391
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,690
- It's never gonna be enough. - Claire, stop.

392
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,390
You can't pack a lifetime of things you're gonna miss into one day.

393
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,070
Your situation sucks, and it is unfair.

394
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,520
But you know what, life sucks, and it's unfair,

395
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,640
and things end before we're ready.

396
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,190
We are going back. Now.

397
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,450
No.

398
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,870
I'm not gonna have the surgery.

399
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,900
How long before I know

400
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,850
if I've let you talk me into something really stupid?

401
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,240
You could have an acute toxic reaction and die

402
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,750
in the next 24 hours.

403
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,040
But we hope to see some positive sign

404
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,610
your body is responding soon.

405
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,820
Okay.

406
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,630
Your transfusion is done.

407
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,530
We'll check on you in a half-hour.

408
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,870
Dr. Murphy.

409
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,910
Would you... sit with me?

410
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,390
What do you want to know?

411
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,650
Nothing. I...

412
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,030
I just want someone to be here.

413
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,160
In case I croak.

414
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,000
It's probably all your annoying girlfriend wants, too.

415
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,250
Just to know you're there.

416
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,420
Carly's in good health and unlikely to die soon.

417
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,470
Some girls have all the luck.

419
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,360
Debbie!

420
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,860
You bellowed?

421
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,050
This thing is broken.

422
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,460
Can you call someone from I.T. and send them over, please?

423
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,410
Oh, I meant to tell you that I, um, upgraded our software.

424
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,430
It's gonna be faster, more efficient.

425
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,160
Not if I don't know how to use it.

426
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,520
You can't just change my entire software system without asking me.

427
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,060
I didn't change it. I upgraded it. There.

428
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,350
Or kick out my Chief of Surgery.

429
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,730
Or interrupt my appointments.

430
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,190
You'll be here 20 hours a day

431
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,900
if you don't stick to a schedule.

432
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,010
It's my call.

433
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,240
I'm not here to slap on Band-Aids

434
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,060
or to write prescriptions.

435
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,990
That woman had serious issues we needed to discuss.

436
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,250
The one with the rodent in her purse?

437
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,750
It's a squirrel. It's a Northern flying squirrel.

438
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,620
You weren't gonna fix whatever issues she has

439
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,920
- with an extra five minutes. - It's my clinic, okay? !

440
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,280
I decide how it runs!

441
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,450
Okay.

442
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,200
I thought that you wanted me to be a part of it.

443
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,120
You know, to actually help and to...

444
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,060
make changes, have opinions.

445
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,400
But if that's not what you want,

446
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,050
then I -- I should do what I promised...

447
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,680
I quit.

448
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,350
You're out of sutures.

449
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,660
I'm sorry.

450
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,290
I -- I shouldn't have said any of that.

451
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,420
I lost somebody recently.

452
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,050
And it hurts.

453
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,430
A lot.

454
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,140
And I took it out on you, and that is unfair.

455
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,520
But if you don't have this surgery,

456
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:51,300
you won't ever drink another slushy at a baseball game.

457
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,870
Or feel the wind in your hair when you speed down the road.

458
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,620
Or...

459
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,370
Or touch a naked woman.

460
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,800
Now, this sucks. It really, really sucks.

461
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,800
But it will get less sucky.

462
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:19,160
And the part that hurts so much right now

463
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,180
will start to hurt less.

464
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,790
And life goes on,

465
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,170
and you will have wonderful moments,

466
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,190
sucky moments.

467
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,240
And it will be your life.

468
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,410
And it'll be a good life, Charlie.

469
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,960
I suspect it might even be a great life.

470
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,970
Oh, thank God. 

471
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,590
Sorry it took a while.

472
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,300
Car trouble.

473
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,030
Welcome back, Charlie.

474
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,100
You had some good people very worried.

475
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,940
I'm really sorry.

476
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,900
You guys can ground me forever for this, but I just...

477
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,570
I just wanted to have one last day of fun.

478
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,160
We can be fun, too. Again.

479
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,200
I was thinking

480
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,500
it might be time to reintroduce the SFADs.

481
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,880
Baseball games, concerts, staying up late.

482
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,880
That sounds pretty lame.

483
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,630
We're running a little late,

484
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,550
and we need to get you prepped.

485
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,890
I'm sorry. I need some 5-0 nylon sutures.

486
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,110
And apparently we need to talk.

487
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,610
You can report back to the Chief of Surgery that I'm fine.

488
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,470
You don't have to talk to me. You don't have to talk to her.

489
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,120
But you need to talk to someone.

490
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,310
I'm not a med student, Aaron. I've lost patients before.

491
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,210
But you never lost someone who should have lived.

492
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,090
No one would be fine. I wouldn't be.

493
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,340
You're not fine.

494
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,220
If for no other reason than your boss doesn't think so.

495
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,940
And the bigger problem

496
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,840
is your girlfriend agrees with her.

497
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,950
We'll be right there as soon as you wake up.

498
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,560
We love you so much.

499
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,820
I love you, too.

500
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,590
We'll take good care of him.

501
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,010
Thank you.

502
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,520
You ready?

503
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,150
Yeah.

504
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,290
I forgot to take his vitals.

505
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,160
I'm sorry.

506
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,120
Go ahead, I'll -- I'll bring him out.

507
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,570
I-I thought you already took my --

508
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,430
Shut up.

509
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,650
We're bringing the patient down now.

510
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,000
Vitals okay?

511
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,480
Temp might be a little up, but he's ready now.

512
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,120
I just need you to count back from 10.

513
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,210
10...

514
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,290
9...

515
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,540
8...

516
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,800
7...

517
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:01,970
6...

518
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,130
5...

519
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,690
You were right.

520
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,820
I'm not fine.

521
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,080
It's okay not to be fine.

522
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,600
You can't blame yourself.

523
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,670
I was the one holding the knife. The blame lies with me.

524
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:50,050
But the responsibility is ours.

525
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,520
Yours and...mine?

526
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,770
Yes.

527
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,060
You're not objective about me...

528
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,570
because of our relationship.

529
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,130
If we weren't together,

530
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,950
I'm not sure you would've agreed to let me do that surgery.

531
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,760
You honestly believe I approved a procedure

532
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,930
that I didn't think you could do

533
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,550
because we're sleeping together?

534
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,140
No. You thought I could do it.

535
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,500
That's the problem.

536
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,690
I think your personal feelings

537
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,220
may have led you to overestimate me.

538
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,800
You came to me.

539
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,450
You sold me the surgery,

540
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,270
told me that you could pull it off.

541
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:41,540
And now I'm at fault because I believed that you --

542
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,150
It's not about fault.

543
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,000
It's about being aware

544
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,900
so that this doesn't happen again.

545
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,360
It will happen again.

546
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,910
I will make decisions. You will have bad outcomes.

547
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,540
That doesn't mean either of us was wrong.

548
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,250
My approval had nothing to do with our relationship.

549
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,210
We can't know that for sure.

550
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,510
If we weren't dating, that woman might still be alive.

551
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,310
And we both have to live with that.

552
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,070
Mom?

553
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,690
Dad?

554
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,380
We're here, honey.

555
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,400
We're right here.

556
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,920
You did so good.

557
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,450
We're so proud of you, buddy.

558
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,500
Charlie.

559
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,960
It's Dr. Reznick. How are you feeling?

560
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,670
Not awesome.

561
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,670
Are you in any pain?

562
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,010
No.

563
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,800
No, I'm okay.

564
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,510
I'll let you rest.

565
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,470
Wait, Dr. Reznick.

566
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,270
Yes?

567
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,810
Thank you so much.

568
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,110
For everything.

569
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,480
You're welcome.

570
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,030
And Dr. Browne?

571
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,570
Dr. Browne, are you here?

572
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,180
Your T-cell count has increased.

573
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,390
And your fever dropped to 99.3.

574
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,040
Your body's fighting the infection.

575
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,810
So, what does that mean? I'm cured?

576
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,060
It's too early to use that word exactly.

577
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,210
We'll need to keep you in isolation for a few more weeks

578
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,010
to make sure that your immune system is developing on pace.

579
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,760
And there is still a 5% to 7% chance of a toxic reaction.

580
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,560
But yes, the cure appears to be working.

581
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,100
You should tell your parents the good news.

582
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,190
What are they gonna do? Feed me juice through a straw?

583
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,320
They could just be here.

584
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:52,990
I'm fine.

585
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,510
Let us know if you need anything.

586
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,950
I'll check in on you in the morning.

587
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,040
Thank you.

588
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,670
For not killing me.

589
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,290
You're welcome.

590
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,900
Oh, there is still a 5% to 7% chance of a --

591
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,880
Shaun. She knows.

Aaron, you -- you do not owe me a gift.

I owe you an apology.

600
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:45,320
I was out of line today. I was pushing way too hard.

601
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,600
It's not a gift.

602
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,110
Is it punishment?

603
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,650
Nurses swear by them.

604
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,780
The arch supports are supposed to be spectacular.

It was a bad idea, terribly executed.

Two of the smartest women I know --

608
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,770
my wife and my new office manager --

609
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,890
think that I need to make some changes.

610
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,280
You wanted to help, you wanted to be a part of my life,

611
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,220
I fought it.

612
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,640
I proposed, and then I freaked out.

613
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,740
We got married --

614
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,370
- You freaked out again. - Yes, I did.

615
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,500
But for a legitimate reason.

616
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,820
There was a gun in the house, but that's not the point.

617
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,240
The point is that, in the midst of all of this...

618
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,300
I took on not one,

619
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,130
but two jobs at the hospital.

620
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,260
Yeah, which you love.

621
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,540
Not more than you.

622
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,210
Come back to the clinic.

623
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,300
Do I get to boss you around?

624
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,970
A little.
