How to get
your medical license back

698
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,423
So you could start
your practice up again,

699
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,959
Or, if you wanted, come work
with us at s.T.A.R. Labs.

700
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,195
I don't know.
I mean--

701
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,898
What's wrong? You okay?
- Yeah, it's a party.

702
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,233
Come on, we can talk about
all this tomorrow.

703
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:30,840
- Talk about what?
- Barry...

704
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:35,478
- Are you not planning
on sticking around?

705
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,447
- Okay.

706
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,583
Okay, do you think--

707
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:46,823
Can you be all that
you are becoming...

708
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,393
With me here?

709
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:51,561
- [chuckles]

710
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:59,101
You're the only family
that i have left.

711
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,007
- Well, that's not
really true, is it?

712
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,044
Don't you have another
family in this room?

713
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,781
They need
your help too, barry.

714
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:15,151
When you need me,
i will be here,

715
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,919
But right now,
central city doesn't need you

716
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,721
To be henry allen's son.

717
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:23,259
It needs you to be
the flash.

718
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,496
My kid.

719
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,868
The superhero.

720
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,973
[sighs]

721
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:41,210
I have to go.

722
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:50,486
I need you to tell me
that it's okay.

723
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,154
- Yeah.

Gideon showed us.

00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:08,464
I was thinking, you know,

744
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,466
You shouldn't fear the future
anymore, right?

745
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,369
- No, and it'll be here
faster than we think.

Increased security

The man asked you
a question.

Who the hell are you?
