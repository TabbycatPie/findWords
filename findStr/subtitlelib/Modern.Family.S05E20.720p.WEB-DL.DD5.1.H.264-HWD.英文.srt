1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,630
Are you getting this?

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,450
I'm getting the shot.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,400
I'm just not getting what you're trying to do.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,290
We're in Australia -- it's on the bottom of the globe,

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,440
so everyone here but me is upside-down.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,150
It's geography.

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,380
It's a good time to tell you --

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,560
I dropped Luke on his head when he was 1.

9
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay, I'm up.

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,520
Did you drop him, too?

11
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,880
Grab my leg, buddy.

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,880
Here we go.

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,750
I come from the land down under.

14
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,300
He doesn't.

15
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,130
I was conceived in Australia on my parents' honeymoon.

16
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,710
It was a romantic summer night -- their summer --

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,150
on a blanket in the park.

18
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,690
I still have that blanket.

19
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,050
Phil's mom left us money for a trip there,

20
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,570
and when the rest of the family found out,

21
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,080
they all just jumped on board.

22
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,830
My mom's grandfather was Australian,

23
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,990
and she'd spend her summers

24
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,180
-- their winters -- visiting him.

25
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,990
It was a very special place for her.

26
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,760
She always wanted me to see it.

27
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,540
Wait -- you still have that blanket?

28
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,520
Yeah, silly. It's the one on our bed.

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,030
You sure you don't want some of this vegemite, Gloria?

30
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,290
You don't know what you're missing.

31
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,790
Ay, I don't eat anything unless I know what's in it.

32
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,570
I've seen this woman scarf down a pig's nose.

33
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,850
Sometimes, one must travel halfway across the globe

34
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,990
to get the clearest view of home.

35
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,380
This was my whole flight.

36
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,440
What's she talking about?

37
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,960
My college-application essay.

38
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,420
They want students who are worldly.

39
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,060
Oh, why don't you write about our trip to Hawaii

40
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,890
when you drank straight from a coconut?

41
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,970
I feel like Harvard's gonna get

42
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,370
a lot of those, so...

43
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,700
Hey, guys, I just wanted to say thanks

44
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,820
for being a part of this pilgrimage to majestic Australia,

45
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,580
which was once a penal colony.

46
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,280
Grow up.

47
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,190
This place was really special to my mom.

48
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,660
She actually left me a list of things

49
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,690
that she thought we should do --

50
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,380
Visit the great Barrier Reef,

51
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,600
See the bush...

52
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,490
Really?

53
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,380
...and climb the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

54
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,860
what do you say, mates?

55
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,750
I'm sorry, honey,

56
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,710
but you know how I am with heights.

57
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,570
Ah. Is that why you never wear high heels?

58
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,250
You guys are with me, right?

59
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,950
- Absolutely not. - Nah, I'm not doing that.

60
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,480
- Really? - No.

61
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,490
No worries.

62
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,550
That's Australian.

63
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,550
I'll, uh, I'll do that one on my own if I have to.

64
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,450
I'm just so excited we're all here together.

65
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,850
- Actually, we have to go. - Yeah, so...

66
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,640
Back in the day, we knew this guy from Australia.

67
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,070
- New Zealand. - Same thing.

68
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,960
He didn't have a lot of friends, and we felt sorry for him,

69
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,100
but the truth is, he was kind of annoying.

70
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,190
He was one of those guys that was always on.

71
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,640
Big relief when his visa ran out.

72
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,090
Anyway, through no fault of my own --

73
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,710
Wait, no, wait --

74
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,960
you announced on Facebook

75
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,390
that we were going to Australia, which is where he lives.

76
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,110
Fergus invited us to lunch. I couldn't say no.

77
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,770
I could have said no.

78
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,180
Which is why you have 12 friends on Facebook.

79
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,980
Claire, honey, I got to tell you,

80
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,250
you really knocked it out of the park on the Hanover deal.

81
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,870
Oh, come on, dad. That was all you.

82
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,790
No, it was you.

83
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,100
No, it was you!

84
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,180
It was you. It was your baby.

85
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,300
This was my whole flight.

86
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,420
Claire took the lead on her first project at the company

87
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,300
and scored a big one.

88
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,800
Best part is, she beat out that arrogant gasbag Earl Norton

89
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,000
over at Closets, Closets, Closets, Closets.

90
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,010
I wish I could see the look

91
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,070
on his stupid face, face, face, face.

92
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,380
So, what's first?

93
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,530
I think Manny wants to see the Opera House.

94
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,320
Actually, it was a long flight.

95
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,010
I was thinking maybe just... Hang out on Bondi beach.

96
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,040
That's a great idea, Manny.

97
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,240
Bondi beach is topless.

98
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,130
Thank you, TripAdvisor.

99
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,000
Beach it is.

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,510
Let's get this Aussie party started!

101
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,870
Oh, my god. What's wrong with your mouth?

102
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,590
Ay! Your lips are huge!

103
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,930
I think you're allergic to the ve-he-mi-te.

104
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,990
No worries.

105
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,950
I'd be a little worried.

My mom said that Joe is fine,

111
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,940
he ate, he slept, he woke up, and then he ate again.

112
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,320
Classic Joe.

113
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,310
So, uh, Luke and I are gonna take a break from the sun.

114
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,080
Yeah. We're kind of tired.

115
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,940
Tired of not seeing boobs.

116
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,730
Watching the natives take nourishment from their land

117
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,950
has made me acutely aware of the fact

118
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,890
that I am just saying words now.

119
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,720
What is wrong with me?

120
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,160
I'm totally blocked.

121
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,970
So am I. Scooch.

122
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,090
How's it going?

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,450

He's totally gorgeous.

125
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,750
This country's number-one export is hot surfers.

126
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,370
I'm not gonna buy the first one I see.

127
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,880
I'm still browsing.

128
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,090
Ooh! Kangaroos! I'm going to buy one.

129
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,790
Lily, what did I just say?

130
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,160
I don't know. Something about shoes, probably?

131
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,310
Your dad gave you enough money for one souvenir.

132
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,690
Don't buy the first thing you see.

133
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,400
You'll regret it your whole trip.

134
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,350
You're right.

135
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,030
I have enough regret.

136
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,320
You got to be kidding me.

137
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,830
We got outbid!

138
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,770
What? By whom?

139
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,390
I'll give you four guesses.

140
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,050
Damn it.

141
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,160
Wait a second.

142
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,290
They're giving us 48 hours to submit a new bid.

143
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,350
We can do that.

144
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,130
We can totally do that.

145
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,570
Let's go back to the hotel and figure it out.

146
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,280
Can it wait?

147
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,380
Yeah, we're on vacation.

148
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,960
Oh, sorry, guys. We have to do this.

149
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,190
This is my baby.

150
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,880
Jay.

151
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,310
- Dad! - Claire.

152
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,380
Gloria.

153
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,320
Fine! You two go back to work.

154
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,070
Phil and I, we're going to walk to the ocean,

155
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,660
and we're going to have more fun without you.

156
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,850
Yeah, we will.

157
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,290
No, we won't. Not at all.

158
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,060
Why would you guys even say that?

159
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,610
So, after sitting there for 40 minutes,

160
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,540
I tell the waitress,

161
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,710
"I'm actually in a hurry.

162
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,670
Any chance of getting the eggs

163
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,450
before they turn into chickens?"

164
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,840
You know? And she's a total bogan.

165
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,090
She's like, "I've got five tables!"

166
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,090
You know how they have the tray?

167
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,930
She's sashaying with the legs.

168
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,720
"Oh, who's got the waffles?!

169
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,770
Who-- who's got the waffles?!"

170
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,000
All right, we get it. We get it.

171
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,040
People are looking.

172
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,360
Oh, nothing I can do to stop that.

173
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,760
Well, I can think of one thing.

174
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,430
- Well, listen, Fergus, it has been great catching up, - Yes.

175
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,700
but we really have to spend some time with our family today.

176
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,970
I'm -- I'm so sorry. Um, Mr. Anderson?

177
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,550
We are huge fans.

178
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,650
Could we get a picture?

179
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,510
Of course. Come on.

180
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,480
Bring it in.

181
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,100
Sit down there. There you go.

182
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,200
I won't get up.

183
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,820
What's happening?

184
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,780
I don't know. Google him.

185
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,650
I didn't spring for an international data plan.

186
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,520
Thank you so much.

187
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,880
You like that? All right.

188
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,130
Oh, my god!

189
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,830
Hey, remember your old downstairs neighbor

190
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,950
that could put his entire fist in his mouth?

191
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,930
Cam.

192
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,480
I think my fist got bigger.

193
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,070
Wait. Fergus,

194
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,400
you have your own show?

195
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,280
Yeah. It's just a little talk show.

196
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,110
No big deal.

197
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,650
It's a big deal here, I suppose,

198
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,490
but yeah.

199
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,120
It's a shame you guys have got to leave so soon.

200
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,660
Oh, well, you know,

201
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,850
we could stay for a little bit longer.

202
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,150
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's fine.

203
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,430
You never finished the story about the waitress and the...

204
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,540
Yeah, with the...

205
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,820
"Who had the waffles?!"

206
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,690
- Waffles?! - Waffles?!

207
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,370
I just feel bad that Claire and Jay

208
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,070
are missing such a beautiful day in this gorgeous country,

209
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,750
which is also a continent.

210
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,410
You have a lot of facts.

211
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,640
I think this spiritual journey of yours is a wonderful thing.

212
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,060
I think it's gonna make you feel closer to your mother.

213
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,130
I hope so.

214
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,320
I miss her.

215
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,050
It's the biggest reason I came here -- to connect.

216
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,030
Is that weird?

217
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,120
Not at all.

218
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,790
I talk to my late grandmother all the time.

219
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,770
She would have loved this place.

220
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,290
I wonder if she's here with me now.

221
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,910
No, she doesn't like to fly.

222
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,220
Isn't it wild that my mom and dad made footprints

223
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,220
in this very sa-- aah!

224
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,250
What?!

225
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,480
Something bit me!

226
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,820
Jellyfish!

227
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,610
What is this?

228
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,790
Not one topless woman.

229
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,710
Calm down.

230
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,360
You're gonna spook the boobs.

231
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,140
Uh, wait -- 2:00.

232
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,580
Hey, Luke!

233
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,710
Luke! How deep is it?!

234
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,960
Be cool! We don't want to look like idiots!

235
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,240
I lost my bathing suit!

236
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,920
Manny, help me find it!

237
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,260
I don't have my nose plug!

238
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,830
Little boy, are you okay?

239
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,870
Manny, say something!

240
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,160
Miss! Miss! He lost his bathing suit!

241
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,120
Oh, honey, I can help you find it. It's okay.

242
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,090
I'm fine!

243
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,950
The water's really clear.

244
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,730
I love your limo!

245
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,780
You don't think it draws too much attention to me?

246
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,650
What are you talking abo-o-o-o-o-ut?!

247
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,810
No.

248
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,720
We ended up spending a little more time with Fergus

249
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,500
than we planned.

250
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,650
Which, honestly, felt like growth to us,

251
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,140
- Yes. - Because I think

252
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,020
sometimes we judge people before we get to know them.

253
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,690
I cannot believe they let us in here.

254
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,000
How famous are you?

255
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,460
Well, sometimes, I feel like I'm the one in the zoo.

256
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,620
Only difference between me and this guy

257
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,930
is I won't pee on you.

258
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:40,930
Right?

259
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,470
Seriously, they will pee on you.

260
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,520
Oh, for real? He will pee on us?

261
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,650
- Okay. - Is that so?

262
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,280
Turns out, we have a lot in common.

263
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,110
For example, we all hate standing in lines.

264
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,650
Make sure I get copies of those.

265
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,910
Isn't he funny?

266
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,850
We're with him, so we're just gonna...

267
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,770
Come on. Through you go.

268
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,260
Sorry. Classic Fergus,

269
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,770
getting us in like this.

270
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,370
Cam.

271
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,330
Where's the next gift shop?

272
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,460
I cannot look at another souvenir, Lily.

273
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,160
You did this.

274
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,920
Lily, relax.

275
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,350
You'll find the perfect one.

276
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,090
I want to believe you,

277
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,520
but that lifeguard was the cutest boy I've ever seen.

278
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,630
I know.

279
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,840
Hey, guys!

280
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,120
Found 'em in the business center.

281
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,220
Come on. We got to catch the bus to the bush.

282
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,620
What time did you wake up?

283
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,290
5:00 A.M. Claire has an incredible work ethic.

284
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,850
She's like a young me.

285
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,520
Yung-mi was our accountant from Korea.

286
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,850
Died at her desk.

287
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,150
Okay, enough work.

288
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,850
- It's time to enjoy our vacation. - Yeah.

289
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,130
Yeah, we just got to finish up a few quick, little thi--

290
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,200
No, you're done.

291
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,700
- Done. We're done. - Let's go.

292
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,100
Jay, I miss you.

293
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,220
And besides, I don't know that I can keep Phil safe anymore.

294
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,980
I think he's going to die here.

295
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,750
Oh, it's Fergus.

296
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,550
What? Why did he text you and not me?

297
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,690
He invited us to a party today on Hugh Jackman's yacht.

298
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,880
What?! Not today! No!

299
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,990
I want to meet Hugh Jackman!

300
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,120
I do, too. I do, too.

301
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,840
But, you know, w-we can't bail on my family again.

302
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,050
That makes us complete star you-know-what-ers.

303
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,820
Plus, Cam, this will be fun, too.

304
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,540
Everybody have their sunscreen and bug spray?

305
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,020
I got the snakebite kit.

306
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,240
Hey, guys, we just got some really bad news.

307
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,520
Yeah, so...

308
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,050
Walking the paths once trod by the first Australians

309
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,320
has made me...what?

310
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,550
Unbearable?

311
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,850
Now, if we're lucky,

312
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,590
we'll see some of Australia's more famous indigenous species --

313
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,640
kangaroo, dingoes, koala.

314
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,320
Quick question.

315
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,550
Oh, good -- another one.

316
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,270
Isn't it true that baby kangaroos, or -- or joeys,

317
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,740
are born without hind legs?

318
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,570
Yes.

319
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,590
Once again, you've correctly answered your own question.

320
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,140
I just got a text from earl at Closets, Closets, Closets --

321
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,820
I know what it's called, dad.

322
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,580
Listen to this -- "Better luck next time. Ha ha."

323
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,950
He always knows what to say to get my goat.

324
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm waiting for a quote from the lumber supplier,

325
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,640
but this hike is three hours -- I'm gonna lose signal.

326
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,450
Let's go back.

327
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,680
Dad, we can't just up and leave without a plausible reason wh--

328
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,830
Claire's hurt!

329
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,570
What happened?

330
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,180
Well, you know what a klutz she is.

331
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,210
Honey, are you okay?

332
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:00,990
Not really.

333
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,320
Yeah, well, I -- let me get her back to camp.

334
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,370
We're just gonna slow you down.

335
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,500
- Come on, sweetheart. -Yeah, you guys have fun.

336
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,720
How dumb do they think we are?

337
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,650
Sometimes, claire leaves me pictures of food

338
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,250
instead of a shopping list.

339
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,950
I'm so nervous.

340
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,830
Are we gonna see Hugh Jackman in a bathing suit?

341
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,730
What do we say to hugh jackman in a bathing suit?

342
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,370
Oh, my god. It's so big.

343
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,120
That's a bit direct, but, you know, he might be flattered.

344
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,640
Oh, you're talking about the boat.

345
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,320
Fergus!

346
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,260
Fergus!

347
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,820
Oh, guys. Thank god you're here.

348
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,600
Just had the worst fight with Hugh.

349
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,920
Oh, no. What happened?

350
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,870
I took a shot at Russell Crowe in "Les Mis."

351
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,990
Hugh took offense.

352
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,250
Oh, well, he has to know

353
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,240
- Russell was horribly miscast. - He has to know.

354
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,020
Horribly miscasted.

355
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,460
- It's not his fault. - It's not his fault.

356
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,720
He was -- the acting was fine, but --

357
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay, let's get on this boat and fix this.

358
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,140
Yep. Fix it.Come on.

359
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,410
That's not the boat.

360
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,720
They've already gone.

361
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,850
Hugh was standing on his deck in a skimpy, little bathing suit,

362
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,180
disappointed look on his face.

363
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,610
Wait. I'm s-- wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Skimpy?

364
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,950
I'm sorry -- standing on his what?

365
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,950
On his deck.

366
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,010
Of the boat. Got it. Okay.

367
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,210
You know what?

368
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,550
We don't need them.

369
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,180
I'll hire a boat. We'll have our own party!

370
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,560
This is the life, eh, boys?

371
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,090
Oh, s-- so we're not taking this to a bigger boat?

372
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,860
A bigger boat!

373
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,080
Have a meat pie.

374
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,350
No, thank you. No.

375
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,820
No, thanks.

376
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,190
Are you okay, Phil?

377
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,320
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

378
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,340
I just wish Claire was here to see all this.

379
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,470
Plus, my foot's twice its normal size,

380
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,080
and the mosquitoes are really going after my jellyfish bites.

381
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,510
Look! A sign!

382
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,360
What?

383
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,530
You wanted to see a kangaroo, and now you see one.

384
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,490
I think this is your mother trying to tell you

385
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,630
that the rest of the trip is going to be magical, Phil.

386
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,350
That is so my mom,

387
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,290
to say it with a kangaroo.

388
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,400
Look.

389
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,840
So beautiful.

390
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,000
Okay, but be careful. You're gonna scare him.

391
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,620
G'day, mate.

392
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,600
Hey, aren't you gor--

393
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,770
This one.

394
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,840
No, this one!

395
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,050
No, this one!

396
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,170
I can't breathe!

397
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,530
Shopping with Lily is the best birth control in the world.

398
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,470
Yeah.

399
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,710
But you know it's not, right?

400
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,080
Ooh! This one!

401
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,380
Thank god. Hurry up and buy it.

402
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,250
Wait. What if there's a better one later?

403
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,050
Let's keep looking.

404
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,670
No, no, no! You are buying that.

405
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,890
You're never gonna find anything better.

406
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,510
I never found a hotter lifeguard, okay?

407
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,460
This is perfect, and it is right in front of you.

408
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,130
Here. Thanks.

409
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,120
I really love your accent.

410
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,130
Wow. Thank you.

411
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,350
I would like to return this.

412
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,920
Penny for your thoughts?

413
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,120
Boobs.

414
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,140
Me too!

415
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,330
What's our problem?

416
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,190
I freaked out when those things came at us.

417
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,330
I think I could've handled one,

418
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,800
but they ganged up on me.

419
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,930
Hey, boys.

420
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,700
How would you like to participate

421
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,220
in an aboriginal walkabout?

422
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,760
No, thanks. Why don't you ask those girls over there?

423
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,230
This walkabout's for men only.

424
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,840
Trust me -- we're not men.

425
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,560
Sounds like you need this more than anyone.

426
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,810
Quick -- come here.

427
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,510
Perfect. Now we're wearing makeup.

428
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,790
You have got to be kidding me.

429
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,590
Okay, can we walk to the bush?

430
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,600
Nah. Dispatch is sending a cab in an hour.

431
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,740
- An hour. - What?!

432
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,450
No, Cam, we deserve this.

433
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,010
We deserted our family, we abandoned our daughter,

434
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,230
and for what?

435
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,110
We're not just star you-know-what-ers.

436
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,530
We're you-know-what-holes!

437
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,300
You know Lily's not here, right?

438
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,080
Oh, my god.

439
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,560
Please be cool.

440
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,100
I'm always cool.

441
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,700
Hello!

442
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,420
There's some pretty fancy shoes.

443
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,800
Thank you...?

444
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,870
So, listen, we don't want any trouble,

445
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,510
uh, but my -- my friend and I --

446
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,560
"Friend"? Really?

447
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,660
Yeah.

448
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,870
Our cab broke down,

449
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,910
and we are trying to get to our daughter --

450
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,850
The daughter my friend and I have together.

451
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,320
Well, that ain't right.

452
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,010
Daddies should be with their little girls.

453
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,440
Seriously, where can I get a pair of them shoes?

454
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,470
He wants your shoes. Give him your shoes.

455
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,270
What? All right.

456
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,760
I don't want your shoes. I want to get me own.

457
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,800
He doesn't want your shoes. Put your shoes on.

458
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,360
I knew it!

459
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,400
Gloria, don't be mad.

460
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,050
Too late!

461
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,910
I know this looks really bad,

462
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,820
but you have to understand that this is my --

463
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,980
Your baby?! I know.

464
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,010
And you should be ashamed of yourself!

465
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,620
You have a husband who is on a spiritual journey

466
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,530
and was punched by a kangaroo!

467
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,500
What?!

468
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,130
Gloria!

469
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,770
Honey, I just heard.

470
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,410
How did you get punched by a kangaroo?

471
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,480
Really hard.

472
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,550
In the face.

473
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,270
Oh. I'm sorry.

474
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,430
Oh, boy.

475
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,820
Is there anything I can do?

476
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,200
Could you stop working and sit with me for a while?

477
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,720
- Yes, of course I can. - Thank you.

478
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,220
Okay. Be -- be soft.

479
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,030
Okay. Thank you. Aw, baby.

480
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,490
Oh, my god. Phil.

481
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,710
Honey!

482
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,840
Phil! A wild dog took my laptop!

483
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,750
Seems like a missed opportunity.

484
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,930
Honey, if you want to work, just say so.

485
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,950
No! It happened! It just happened!

486
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,130
I didn't see anything.

487
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,760
I didn't see you get hit in the face by a kangaroo,

488
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,580
but I believe you.

489
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,730
Come on! Help me get it!

490
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,250
No! You're on your own!

491
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,260
Like I've been this whole trip!

492
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,280
For god's sakes!

493
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,150
Gloria, stop! Let me explain!

494
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,130
Fine -- but the explanation better not be

495
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,580
that this is an important account and you're on a deadline

496
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,800
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

497
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,400
Oh. Well, I'm gonna need a minute to think.

498
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,650
I did not leave Joe, fly across the world,

499
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,580
to see you spend all your time working!

500
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,380
You're missing the whole vacation!

501
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,380
Not the first wife to tell me that.

502
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,950
So how many wives need to say it before you listen?

503
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,790
What's that?

504
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,110
I'm not gonna tell you.

505
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,760
If you were here, you would know what that is.

506
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,960
I don't know what that was.

507
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,810
But I was not going to give him the satisfaction.

508
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,400
Damn it!

509
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,560
Why, Australia?! Why?!

510
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,080
Hey, mate.

511
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,550
How's...it going?!

512
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,790
Everything okay here?

513
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,880
Not really.

514
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,600
You don't mind me saying, you look a bit beaten up.

515
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,550
Yeah.

516
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,780
I love your country,

517
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,740
but your country doesn't love me back.

518
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,060
Australia's rejected me.

519
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,100
You see this right here?

520
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,440
That's from a croc bite.

521
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,400
This one here on my back --

522
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,540
I was hit by a tram in Melbourne.

523
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,250
This right here --

524
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,380
That's an irregular mole.

525
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,490
Should probably get that checked out.

526
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,860
Point is -- Australia is nice to tourists,

527
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,050
but it's tough on its own people.

528
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,140
Congratulations, mate.

529
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,220
You're one of us.

530
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,600
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

531
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,550
I think I am.

532
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,260
I'm Crocodile Dunphy?

533
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,160
That's...not what I was saying at all.

534
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,750
Is that a kookaburra, which are born blind, or --

535
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,070
Mom?

536
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,190
There you are.

537
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,350
Dad, the laptop is gone.

538
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,880
We've got to get back to the hotel right now.

539
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,820
It's still fresh in my mind.

540
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,590
I think I can just piece it together --

541
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,570
Claire.

542
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,330
Let it go.

543
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,950
What? No!

544
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,450
I-I poured my heart into this.

545
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,240
And don't you want to stick it to Earl?

546
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,400
Doesn't matter.

547
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,280
Go be with your family.

548
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,060
Remember when you were a kid?

549
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,680
We'd take the family trips?

550
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,550
I'd disappear for days to work.

551
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,600
Don't be me.

552
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,540
I feel like I'm letting you down.

553
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,700
What are you talking about?

554
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,780
I finally get to spend a little vacation time with my daughter.

555
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,980
Yeah.

556
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,920
What is that?

557
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,940
Lily! We're here!

558
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,740
Daddies love you!

559
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,970
Daddies!

560
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,290
Oh, my gosh!

561
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,450
Oh, this place is beautiful!

562
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,000
That's our bus! Time to go!

563
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,330
What do you mean?

564
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,640
- Who are these guys? - Who's this guy?

565
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,940
Honey, I am so sorry.

566
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,900
From now on, I am all yours.

567
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,800
I promise -- whatever you want to do.

568
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,920
Phil, this is not what I had in mind.

569
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,500
You're doing great, honey.

570
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,920
What is a bridge?

571
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,520
It's a connecter, a supporter,

572
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,630
and sometimes, it's a metaphor for the love --

573
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,660
- Oh, my gosh! Stop!! - Come on!

574
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,710
Hello, from the Great Barrier Reef!

575
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,270
That was awesome!

576
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,320
Yes!

577
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,100
Thank you for choosing to fly Qantas

578
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,240
on our nonstop flight from Australia to Los Angeles.

579
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,290
I feel a little guilty sitting up here without the family.

580
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,980
- I don't. - Me, either.

581
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,040
Don't you think it's a little rude

582
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,120
that they're sitting up there?

583
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,600
I would never do that.

584
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,290
Boy, you tense up fast after a vacation.

585
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,690
I swear, that's Hugh Jackman up there.

586
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,900
I saw him when we boarded.

587
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,310
I don't think it's him.

588
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,610
Oh, well, I'm gonna go find out.

589
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,280
Cam, no. Cam, come on.

590
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,990
Let him go, or none of us will get any sleep.

591
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,030
Hey, guys. Just saying hi.

592
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,640
'scuse me.

593
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,720
I don't think he belongs up here.
