1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,641
Now I remember a lot of stories from back in the days before I met your mother.

2
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:19,847
But there's one story I don't remember.

3
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:23,454
Uncle Marshall still refers to it as "The Pineapple Incident."

4
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,741
The night started like any other.

5
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:27,388
We were downstairs at the bar.

6
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:28,665
On the house.

7
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:31,191
It's my own concoction.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,697
I call it the Red Dragon.

9
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,432
- Wow! Thanks!
- That was really sweet.

10
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,851
- We're not really doing shotre we?
- I Hope not.

11
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:40,796
These look kind of like blood.

12
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:45,171
Okay, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before.

13
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:47,781
But is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?

14
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,208
No, you guys, I'm serious. Think about it.

15
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,432
He always wears black.

16
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:54,930
We never see him in the daylight, only after dark.

17
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:56,084
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,168
That does describe a vampire...

19
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:00,616
or, you know, a bartender.

20
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:03,558
I should go get dressed.

21
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:05,121
Where you going, buddy? Hot date?

22
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:07,746
I'll say. She's going out with a billionaire.

23
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:09,666
Lily, I told you not to call him that.

24
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:11,270
Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,314
He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred-millionaire.

26
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:15,104
Why do people always round up?

27
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:18,323
So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?

28
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:19,206
A charity dinner.

29
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:21,269
Yeah, $2,000 a plate.

30
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,560
$1,500. Stop rounding up.

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,252
And it's for Third World hunger.

32
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:26,481
You gonna put out?

33
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:27,976
What?

34
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:29,816
There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner,

35
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:33,233
and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills.

36
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:37,520
I think my soul just threw up a little bit.

37
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,309
Well, I'm gonna be late.

38
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,361
You guys have fun.

39
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:41,481
- Bye.
- See ya.

40
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:42,483
- Bye.
- See ya.

41
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,368
You okay?

42
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:45,639
Sure. Why?

43
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:46,948
Oh, I don't know.

44
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:49,468
Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.

45
00:01:49,548 --> 00:01:52,215
Okay, first of all, hundred-millionaire.

46
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:55,595
And second, she's not the girl of my dreams.

47
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:56,838
We're just friends.

48
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:58,640
Look, it would not be smart if we got together.

49
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,588
I mean, I'm looking to settle down, she's looking for...

50
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,948
Wha...? You done? Great.

51
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:09,126
Check out table number four.

52
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:11,438
See that little hottie on the end?

53
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:16,052
She's short, but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's, like, half boob.

54
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:17,049
Let's go.

55
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:19,779
Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?

56
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,604
I... uh...

57
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:23,524
Daddy's home.

58
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:28,633
Daddy's home? Okay, you want us to go over there right now

59
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:31,528
and say to those girls, "Daddy's home"?

60
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:33,688
Really think about that, Barney.

61
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,717
Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.

62
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:39,286
Okay, think about this.

63
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:43,069
Is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it?

64
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:45,070
Garlic fries.

65
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:46,968
Okay, well, I'll get back to you.

66
00:02:48,054 --> 00:02:50,383
Oh, Daddy's back.

67
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,689
See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...

68
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,913
Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Date Card from Amy.

69
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:00,220
That worked?

70
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:01,218
I hate the world.

71
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,953
Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think.

72
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:06,188
I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.

73
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,075
- Doo-doo.
- Totally.

74
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,654
So I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.

75
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:14,440
Oh, yes, it can.

76
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:16,877
Interesting.

77
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:19,433
Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason.

78
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:22,683
It's like the universe was saying, "Hey, Barney, there's this dude-- he's pretty cool--

79
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:25,265
but it's your job to make him awesome."

80
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:27,874
Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way.

81
00:03:27,952 --> 00:03:30,453
It happened with Robin, it happened with Half Boob,

82
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,998
and it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inibriation style.

83
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:39,655
So, what, you want me to do a shot?

84
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,733
Oh, no.

85
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,919
I want you to do five shots.

86
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,312
More interesting.

87
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:47,977
Barney, I think you've officially...

88
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:50,286
No, don't think. Do.

89
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:52,783
Ted, he's right: you overthink.

90
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:55,082
Maybe you should overdrink.

91
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,037
- Drink, drink...
- Drink, drink, drink...

92
00:03:58,117 --> 00:04:00,272
Uh, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?

93
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:04,761
Guys, you are being immature and moronic, and drink, drink...

94
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:08,728
Drink, drink, drink...

95
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,219
Yeah!

96
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,114
Drink, drink, drink...

97
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,683
Let me tell you something about this dream, okay?

98
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:16,415
Drink!

99
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:19,271
Pure alcohol cannot stop this brain.

100
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:20,620
Drink, drink, drink...

101
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,026
I love it! I love it! I love it!

102
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,251
This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.

103
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,060
Drink, drink, drink...

104
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:28,978
This is a super brain.

105
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,650
Drink, drink, drink...

106
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:33,120
This brain is unstoppable.

107
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,313
This brain...

108
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:36,009
And that's all I remember.

109
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:38,628
Except for a few hazy memories.

110
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,828
But really, the next thing I remember was waking up the following morning.

111
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:13,787
So there were some unanswered questions.

112
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,423
How much did I drink?

113
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,066
How did I sprain my ankle?

114
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,228
And who was this girl in my bed?

115
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,486
There's our rock star.

116
00:05:26,588 --> 00:05:29,518
Okay, uh... What the hell happened last night?

117
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:32,231
You really don't remember, Superbrain?

118
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:35,381
So Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lilly filled me in.

119
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:37,547
And how did you guys like the shots?

120
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:40,039
I drank all five, bitch.

121
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:42,936
I love Drunk Ted.

122
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:44,833
Marshall thinks you're a vampire.

123
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:51,035
If he pukes, one of you guys cleans it up.

124
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,698
No dibs.

125
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:54,634
No d... Damn it!

126
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,725
How quickly you all forget.

127
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,208
I haven't puked since high school.

128
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:01,043
I am vomit-free since '93.

129
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:03,374
Vomit-free since '93.

130
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:05,623
That's funny. I'm funny!

131
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:06,729
Who are you calling?

132
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:07,448
Robin.

133
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,063
Oh, bad idea jeans.

134
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:11,930
No, no, it's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk.

135
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:14,300
You do things you'd never do if you were sober.

136
00:06:14,383 --> 00:06:16,755
Says every girl you've ever slept with.

137
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:18,191
Say what?

138
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:21,923
Hello, Robin. It's Ted.

139
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:23,030
Oh, hi, Ted.

140
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:24,894
Hello, Robin. It's Ted.

141
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:26,479
Hi, Ted.

142
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:27,971
Sounds like you're having fun.

143
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:32,706
Robin, have I ever told you that I am vomit-free since '93?

144
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:35,768
Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right...

145
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,191
'93?

146
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:39,127
Dude, that's impressive.

147
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:43,356
Robin, I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter.

148
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:45,276
You should be on 60 Minutes.

149
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,590
You should be one of the minutes.

150
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,713
That's sweet... and odd.

151
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,167
But I'm kind of on a date right now.

152
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:53,902
Yeah, and I disagree with Barney.

153
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:57,641
Just 'cause this guy's spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out.

154
00:06:57,726 --> 00:07:01,178
Take it slow, Robin. Take it slow.

155
00:07:01,772 --> 00:07:03,293
Slow...

156
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:04,449
Bye, Ted.

157
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,273
Slow...

158
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:09,583
Wow, right. That's why we don't do shots.

159
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,143
Friends don't let friends drink and dial.

160
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:13,271
I need that phone back.

161
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:15,412
You'll get this back at the end of class.

162
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:19,294
Ding. Class dismissed. Here you go, kid. You call whoever you want.

163
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:20,622
Thank you, kind sir.

164
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:24,774
At least someone appreciates the fact that I am doing and not thinking.

165
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,165
And now, I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom.

166
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:33,944
Was that necessary? He is not making smart decisions.

167
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:37,974
Exactly. It's like, what's he gonna do next? I don't know, but I want to find out.

168
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:44,013
Cheap Trick?

169
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:45,979
Oh, Ted.

170
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:50,174
Hello again, Ted.

171
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:54,219
# Hey, it's me again #

172
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:58,790
# Plain to see again #

173
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:05,611
# Please, can I see you every day #

174
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:07,815
I love everyone in this bar!

175
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:10,138
We love you, Drunk Ted!

176
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:14,545
# I'm a fool again #

177
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,124
# I fell in lo... #

178
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:19,946
Ted?

179
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:22,123
Well, that explains the ankle.

180
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:24,477
Then we brought you home and put you to bed.

181
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:27,168
Was there anyone else in there with me?

182
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,979
- There's a girl in there!
- I know.

183
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:42,945
- And a pineapple.
- I know.

184
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:45,014
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

185
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:49,249
What the hell happened to my jacket?

186
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:50,541
Whoa.

187
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:54,123
That girl in there is alive, right?

188
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:57,913
I should call Barney. Maybe he knows what happened.

189
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,832
Hello.

190
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:19,608
Why are you sleeping in our tub?

191
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:22,339
Uh, the porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.

192
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:27,082
Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?

193
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,067
Don't worry. I slept through it.

194
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:32,055
I totally didn't sleep through it.

195
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:36,044
Oh, and wow, for a little girl, you got a big tank.

196
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,208
How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around 1:00.

197
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:42,704
Oh, you put Ted to bed, all right.

198
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:45,067
You guys take care of me.

199
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:46,877
You guys are the best.

200
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:49,200
I love you guys so much.

201
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,944
Good night, Ted.

202
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,262
Love you, too, buddy.

203
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:57,132
I'm back, baby doll!

204
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:59,283
Hey! Hey! Hey!

205
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,918
He rallies!

206
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:02,924
And the night begins now!

207
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:06,043
All right. Game face on. Carl, two more.

208
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,255
All right, what do we think of this one?

209
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:12,166
- I think she...
- Trick question. No thinking.

210
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:16,770
You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride. Bring it!

211
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,020
Hi.

212
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:21,713
Have you met Ted?

213
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,414
Excuse me.

214
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,651
You're calling Robin.

215
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:32,064
I'm calling Robin.

216
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:36,631
Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.

217
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:37,918
Oh, yeah?

218
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:39,547
What you gonna do?

219
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,021
If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire.

220
00:10:46,264 --> 00:10:47,621
You're bluffing.

221
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:52,001
Hello, Robin. It's Ted.

222
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:54,830
- Ted, for the last time, stop...
- Ow!

223
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:57,139
Ted?

224
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:59,676
You set me on fire.

225
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:01,741
Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast.

226
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:03,332
You got robbed. This is a blend.

227
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:07,462
You set me on fire.

228
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:09,802
And who's the girl in my bed?

229
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,053
There's a girl in your bed.

230
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:26,461
And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?

231
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:27,770
Who is she?

232
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,330
I have no idea.

233
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,556
Nice.

234
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,533
You really don't know who that is?

235
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,684
No. After I hosed you down with the beverage gun, I brought you back here.

236
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:37,492
I better not have gotten burned.

237
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,949
Did any of you write that?

238
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:46,709
"Hi. I'm Ted. If lost, please call..."

239
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,747
Whose number is that?

240
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:50,927
I don't know.

241
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:53,359
Dude, call it.

242
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,255
Ooh, hold on, I'm gonna make some popcorn.

243
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:00,334
Ooh. Okay, you can call now.

244
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,698
God, this is intense. I love it.

245
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:06,892
Hello?

246
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:09,416
Uh... hi. Who's this?

247
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:11,187
You called me. Who's this?

248
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:13,277
It's Ted.

249
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:15,298
It's Carl from the bar.

250
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,695
And then Carl filled us in.

251
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:19,989
Barney, you've always taken care of me.

252
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,569
You are a gentlemen and a scholar.

253
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:25,540
Go into my stable and take my finest stallion.

254
00:12:25,598 --> 00:12:28,345
He's yours. His name is Windjammer.

255
00:12:29,654 --> 00:12:31,140
Sleep it off, bro.

256
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:36,152
- I'm back, baby doll!
- Yeah.

257
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,593
And I... am gonna throw up.

258
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:44,511
I threw up?

259
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:46,215
Oh, my streak is over.

260
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,059
Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good.

261
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,305
Sorry, Carl. Go on.

262
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:58,765
Carl... did you know the word "karaoke" is Japanese for "empty orchestra"?

263
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:01,214
Isn't that hauntingly beautiful?

264
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:03,844
Are you a vampire?

265
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:06,040
All right, I'm cutting you off.

266
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,733
Go home and get some sleep, Ted.

267
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:10,155
Yeah, the sun's gonna come up soon.

268
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,794
Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we?

269
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:16,337
Hey, how easy do you think it would be to sneak into the zoo?

270
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:18,746
I have to see some penguins, like, right now.

271
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:20,329
All right, give me your arm.

272
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay.

273
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:25,423
This way, if you pass out in the gutter...

274
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:27,016
It tickles.

275
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:31,139
...someone will call me, and I will come get you.

276
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:32,468
Thanks, Carl.

277
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:36,370
We can't just be friends. We're attracted to each other, and we both know it.

278
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:37,646
Excuse me?

279
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:40,617
Me and Robin, me and Robin.

280
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:42,134
I have to make one more call.

281
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:44,084
Yeah, this'll go good.

282
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,414
Hey, it's me again.

283
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:52,921
Look, who are we kidding?

284
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:54,758
You and I are both attracted to each other.

285
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,256
We're young, we're drunk-- half of us anyway-- and we only get one life.

286
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,634
So, why don't you come over to my apartment right now,

287
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,293
and we'll think of something stupid to do together?

288
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:05,556
Really?

289
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,539
Great.

290
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,904
Wait. Really?

291
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:09,552
Great.

292
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:11,417
Thanks, Carl.

293
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:13,824
It's Robin.

294
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,966
That's Robin in there.

295
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:18,874
Did you guys...?

296
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:26,731
Oh, come on. You've got to give me this one.

297
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,848
Those five shots got you further with Robin than your brain ever did.

298
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,405
See what happens when you don't think?

299
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:35,548
You do. More importantly, you do Robin.

300
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:37,260
Come on.

301
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:40,514
All right, right over here.

302
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:43,817
But, uh, still, what does this mean?

303
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,008
Are we dating now?

304
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,577
I-I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but...

305
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:49,582
maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...

306
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,073
Someone get him a shot. He's thinking again.

307
00:14:52,362 --> 00:14:56,110
You know what? Hold on, man. Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one.

308
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,975
You and Robin went down this road before. You got dinged up really bad.

309
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,586
You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin?

310
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:04,608
Robin.

311
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:06,105
Go wake her up.

312
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:08,025
Wake her up and say what?

313
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,681
Daddy's home.

314
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:15,076
Good luck, buddy.

315
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:24,192
Hello.

316
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,682
Ted, it's Robin.

317
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:31,285
Are you sure?

318
00:15:36,654 --> 00:15:40,269
Hey, Robin, how are you?

319
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:44,023
Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night.

320
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:46,613
- Do you mind if I swing by?
- Ask her about the pineapple.

321
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:48,518
- Uh, yeah, sure, come on over.
- Thanks.

322
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,282
No. Wait, d-d-don't come...

323
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:52,515
She's coming over. Crap!

324
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:56,777
Wait. This is killing me. We have to find out who that girl is.

325
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:58,351
Trudy.

326
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:02,078
My name is Trudy.

327
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,698
And then, Trudy filled us in.

328
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,190
I'm just surprised you didn't dump him sooner.

329
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:13,680
I know. It's two years of my life I'm never getting back.

330
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:18,190
A little part of me wants to just jump the bones of the next guy I see.

331
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:20,714
Daddy's home.

332
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:23,277
Or the one after that.

333
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,959
Okay, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so,

334
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:31,817
you just gave me your number... and your name is Amy.

335
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:33,126
Ladies.

336
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,096
I love everyone in this bar!

337
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,705
Look at that idiot go.

338
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:41,308
He's kind of cute.

339
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:50,778
What are you doing in the men's room?

340
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:53,689
What am I doing in the ladies' room?

341
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,353
All right, I came in here, 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.

342
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,384
Did you?

343
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:01,770
I did not.

344
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:06,181
And the streak continues-- vomit-free since '93.

345
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,946
I'm sorry, Trudy. Go on.

346
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:11,950
I liked your performance.

347
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,629
What, the karaoke?

348
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,105
Domo arigato.

349
00:17:16,373 --> 00:17:17,765
I wish I had your guts.

350
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:20,614
Getting up and making a complete idiot of myself.

351
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,065
So, do it.

352
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:23,403
I don't know.

353
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,542
Still, I've had a pretty serious week.

354
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:28,999
I could sure stand to do something stupid.

355
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:31,087
I'm something stupid. Do me.

356
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,091
You're funny.

357
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:35,226
Hey, can I call you sometime?

358
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:36,504
Okay.

359
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,640
Here, let me.

360
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:43,279
Why do they call it karaoke, anyhow?

361
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:46,108
Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okey?

362
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:48,754
These are the kinds of things I think about.

363
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:53,274
Karaoke is Japanese for "empty orchestra."

364
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:57,390
That's hauntingly beautiful.

365
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:01,868
Hey, it works.

366
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:03,972
Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.

367
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:08,616
I got to make one more call.

368
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,121
Hello?

369
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:13,240
Hey, it's me again.

370
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,038
Hey.

371
00:18:14,122 --> 00:18:15,805
Look, who are we kidding?

372
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:17,638
You and I are both attracted to each other.

373
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,524
We're-We're young, we're drunk--

374
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,303
half of us, anyway-- and we only get one life.

375
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:24,708
So, I came over here.

376
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,190
And now, I'm really, really embarrassed.

377
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:31,791
Damn it, Trudy! What about the pineapple?

378
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:33,774
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry!

379
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,604
Ah, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.

380
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:42,707
Why? Is that your girlfriend?

381
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,837
Ah, no, that's not my girlfriend. Um, look, it's complicated.

382
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,007
Oh, you're married. Yeah, I know. I can't believe I did this.

383
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:51,839
No, no, no, I-I'm not married. Um... I'll explain after you hide.

384
00:18:58,754 --> 00:18:59,586
Hey.

385
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:00,355
Hi, guys.

386
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,876
- Hey, Robin, top of the morning.
- Hi, Robin. Good sweater.

387
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:07,924
Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was pretty drunk.

388
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,140
Uh, no kidding.

389
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,263
Those calls were really weird.

390
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,929
Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.

391
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:16,865
- Let's go get a snack.
- I love to snack.

392
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:18,030
I'm good.

393
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,632
Come on, those calls weren't that weird.

394
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:33,792
Robin! Come hang out!

395
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:36,085
Okay, I'm gonna make this sound till you come hang out.

396
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:44,922
That goes on for three and a half minutes.

397
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,363
Without a breath?

398
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:48,307
That's got to be some kind of record.

399
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:51,361
Oh, Ted, you can't do this. Please.

400
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,038
We agreed to be friends, and now you're making it all confusing.

401
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:57,546
No, I'm not. Look, I-I just turned off my brain for the night.

402
00:19:57,644 --> 00:20:00,038
Nothing's changed. You've moved on. I've moved on.

403
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:02,348
Really? You've moved on?

404
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,492
Yes. What, you don't believe me?

405
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:07,338
Oh. Uh, okay.

406
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:10,247
Trudy, come on out.

407
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,967
You are gonna laugh.

408
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:13,848
Wait. You were with someone last night?

409
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:16,273
Yeah, Trudy. She's cool.

410
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,072
Trudy, come on out.

411
00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:21,203
Yeah, seriously, it's okay.

412
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,910
This is so Trudy.

413
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,276
She's really shy...

414
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:27,579
I think.

415
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:29,637
Trudy?

416
00:20:35,707 --> 00:20:39,126
Hi, Trudy. I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you.

417
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,732
You're right. She is shy.

418
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:45,007
I'm not making this up. She-she must have climbed out the fire escape.

419
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:48,905
Whatever. Whatever! I-I don't care what you think.

420
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,288
Then why'd you hide her from me?

421
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,234
Wow. You're good.

422
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:56,637
Anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?

423
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:59,051
Yes. You did... last night.

424
00:20:59,144 --> 00:21:00,326
Really?

425
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:04,880
Get some sleep, Ted.

426
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,258
You had a long night.

427
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,137
And don't feel bad.

428
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:10,245
I've woken up with worse.

429
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:19,953
I left Trudy a message, but she never called me back.

430
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:22,408
That's just how life works sometimes.

431
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:24,149
You turn off your brain for a night,

432
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,075
and all your left with the next day is a bad hangover,

433
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:28,664
a sprained ankle...

434
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:33,375
Oh, we never found out where that pineapple came from,

435
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:35,085
but it was delicious.

436
