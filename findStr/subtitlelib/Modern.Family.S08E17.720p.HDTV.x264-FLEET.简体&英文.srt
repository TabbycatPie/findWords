兄弟
Hey, buddy.

29
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,470
没干什么
Nothing!

30
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,000
不好意思  习惯了
Sorry. Habit.

31
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,460
我还真没做什么不该做的
I'm not actually doing anything wrong.

32
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,600
只是在看亚利桑那州立大学有没有录取我
Just checking to see if I got into A.S.U.

33
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,670
怎么不叫我们一起
Without us?!

34
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,750
大伙  快过来
Guys, get in here!

35
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,680
就是现在
It's happening!

36
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,570
菲尔在网上看了个视频

37
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,410
全家人一起庆祝孩子被大学录取的一刻
of families celebrating the moment their kid got into college.

38
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,350
纯粹的戏剧性  当全家人紧张的期待
For pure drama, you can't beat that thing

39
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,560
变成无比的喜悦爆发出来
when an entire family's nervous anticipation

40
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,670
简直无与伦比
turns into an explosion of utter joy.

41
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,490
-来吧  -来吧  纽约大学
- Come on! - Come on, N-Y...

42
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,360
圣母大学
Notre...

43
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,580
靠
...Damn.

44
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,890
好了  开始吧
All righty, here we go.

45
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,530
开始录像
And record and...

46
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,470
"欢迎进入亚利桑那州"
"Welcome to Arizona State"...

47
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,820
-真的录取了  -我的天啊
- It's happening! - ‭Oh, my God!

48
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,460
"欢迎进入亚利桑那州立大学招生门户
"Welcome to Arizona State's admissions portal.

49
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,870
我们很遗憾地通知您"
"We regret to inform you"...

50
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,960
伙计
Aww, pal...

51
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,070
别搞悬念了
Well, don't leave us in suspense.

52
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,370
到底被录取没有
What did they say?

53
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,520
我刚刚看了一眼莉莉
Hey, I just peeked in on Lily,

54
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,430
你猜是谁蜷在她床上陪她睡觉
and guess who she was curled up with on her bed?

55
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,530
如果不是咱家的猫  我会因为你拿
If it's not the cat, I'm gonna be really upset about

56
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,550
这件事开玩笑而感到十分担忧
how you're teasing this out.

57
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,960
她能有只亲近的宠物我很开心
I love that she has a pet that she's close to

58
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,180
就像当初我和我的宠物猪莉莉一样
like I was with my pet pig Lily.

59
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,340
骗我给咱女儿取了培根的名字
Still no guilt, I see, after tricking me into

60
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,670
看来你至今仍不觉得内疚
naming our daughter after bacon.

61
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,490
我和那只宠物猪很亲近的
I was very close to that pig.

62
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,080
无论如何
For heaven's sakes,

63
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,550
我至今还把她的骨灰放在车库里
I still have her ashes in the garage.

64
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,340
是啊
True.

65
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,620
我最近开始在车库里健身
I recently started exercising in the garage,

66
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,100
在第一天  我
and on the first day, I, uh --

67
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,100
我就"掉"了好几斤
I dropped a couple of pounds.

68
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,610
我早知道米奇尔在骗我
I knew Mitchell was lying.

69
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,620
我只是给他个机会向我坦白
I was just giving him the opportunity to come clean.

70
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,290
我早就发现骨灰瓮空了
I had discovered the urn was empty.

71
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,830
莉莉
Lily?

72
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,200
你知道吗  我在想
You know, I was thinking tonight

73
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,360
今晚从你爸那回来后
maybe we could bury the ashes in the back yard

74
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,850
或许我们能把骨灰在后院下葬
after we get back from your dad's.

75
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,780
今晚悼念她再合适不过了
It's a perfect night to pay tribute.

76
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,720
-为什么  -今晚是猪月
- W-Why? ‭- The Pig Moon.

77
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,810
不好意思  再说一次
I'm sorry? One more time.

78
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,820
猪月
The Pig Moon.

79
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,950
每隔十八年  月亮会发出肉粉色的光晕
Every 18 years, the moon takes on a pink hue,

80
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,640
并与猎户座连成一线
and it aligns with Orion.

81
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,050
在我们老家是件大事
Oh. ‭It's a huge deal back home.

82
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,890
我们会办庆祝活动
There's a festival,

83
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,380
所有监狱都会大赦  以示善意
they empty out all the jails as a sign of goodwill.

84
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,130
所以我们今晚要办个仪式之类的吗
So, we're having, like, a ceremony tonight?

85
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,120
是的  宝贝
Yes, sweetie.

86
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,530
但我们不是要去爷爷家吗
But don't we have grandpa's?

87
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,090
没关系的
Well, you know what?

88
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,400
反正我们总是在找可信的借口好早点离开
We're always looking for a credible reason to leave early.

89
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,610
那到时我们该怎么说
So, what are we supposed to say?

90
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,630
"我们不吃甜点了  得早点回家
"No -- no dessert for us. We got to get home.

91
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,190
我们得把一头德国名种老母猪
We got to bury the 25-year-old ashes

92
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,640
25年的陈年骨灰埋了"
of a Brunswick King sow."

93
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,190
态度真不错
Wow. Nice attitude.

94
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,190
就像你故意想让猪月约翰老人
It's almost like you want Pig Moon John

95
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,850
在你的狩猎靴里装满煤块似的
to fill your hunting boot with coal.

96
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,850
这也太慢了
This is so slow!

97
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,660
如果你在浏览普里契特衣柜的网页
If you're on the Pritchett's Closets website,

98
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,110
我们已经知道加载速度慢的事了
we're aware of the slowdown.

99
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,380
要么是被黑客黑了
It's either a hack by the Chinese

100
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,890
要么是我雇来改善网页的坑货[黑客]搞的
or that Chinese hack I hired to fix the website.

101
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,320
不是  我是在买格洛丽亚·埃斯特凡
No, I'm trying to get tickets

102
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,770
{\an8}美国知名女歌手  出生于古巴
是她将拉丁音乐打进美国市场

103
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,770
今晚演唱会的门票
for tonight's Gloria Estefan concert.

104
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,760
这有点太巧了吧
That's a little on the nose.

105
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,230
妈  又变成这样啦
Mom, it happened again!

106
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,920
杰  你坐在这仔细盯着
Jay, sit down here and pay attention.

107
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,780
等轮到你的时候必须迅速出手
Ugh! You have to move fast when it's your turn,

108
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,050
不然他们就转到下一个人了
or they'll move to the next person.

109
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,570
乔  这就是为什么我们要等到你6岁
Joe, this is exactly why we're not giving you a knife

110
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,270
才让你玩刀
until you turn 6 years old.

111
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,920
我真怀念那些
I missed the days

112
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,460
人们得实际去排队的日子
when people stood in actual lines.

113
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,110
如果你不愿意在下雨天站着苦等
If you weren't willing to stand in the rain,

114
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,890
你就没资格去看加里·帕克特与联盟峡
you didn't get to see Gary Puckett & the Union Gap.

115
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,890
{\an8}六十年代的流行摇滚乐队

116
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,110
我靠
Ow! Damn it!

117
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,730
什么  我才溜号一秒
What? It was one second!

118
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,010
好了  给我吧
Okay, give it back to me.

119
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,270
不用了  我买完了
No need. I got 'em.

120
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,420
真的吗  你付完款了吗
Oh, really? And you paid?

121
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,500
付了  用浏览器
Yeah, you got your browser

122
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,420
填一下信用卡信息
filling out your credit card info.

123
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,330
其实这样不太安全
It's not super secure,

124
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,620
不过不论卡被谁偷了
but, whoever steals them

125
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,870
他可能都没你花得多
will probably spend less than you.

126
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,030
多波美丽的早上啊
Oh, what a B-U-tiful morning.

127
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,230
开个玩笑  因为我被波士顿大学录取了
I joke because I've been accepted to B.U.

128
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,780
曼尼  我真为你骄傲
Oh, Manny, I'm so proud of you!

129
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,990
目前六所学校都录取我了
I'm six for six.

130
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,330
这么多追求者  真不知道该选谁
So many suitors -- not sure which to choose from.

131
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,440
我觉得自己就像
I feel like Lady Mary

132
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,040
上一季《唐顿庄园》里的大小姐玛丽
in the last season of "Downton Abbey."

133
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,760
我要是你就不选以美式足球闻名的学校
I'd avoid the big football schools.

134
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,630
今晚我们要去庆祝一下
And tonight we're going to celebrate.

135
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,540
我们要去看演唱会
We're going to a concert.

136
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,690
我在网上买好票了
I got the tickets online.

137
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,790
网上是比去会场买方便些吧
Easier than buying them at the venue, I guess.

138
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,810
会场在哪啊  随口一问
What is the venue, uh, by the way?

139
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,260
不能去会场门口买的
You can't buy them at the door.

140
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,140
是私人演唱会
It's a private concert.

141
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,500
只有粉丝俱乐部的人才能买票
It's just for the fan club.

142
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,610
我还记得我们第一次去
I remember our first

143
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,220
格洛丽亚·埃斯特凡的演唱会
Gloria Estefan concert.

144
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,800
那时你还那么小
You were so little,

145
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,390
坐在我的肩膀上  举着打火机
sitting on my shoulders, holding the lighter.

146
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,500
我要走了
I'm gonna leave.

147
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,700
是啊  一转眼就要离我而去了
Yes, before I know it.

148
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,700
不  是现在要出门
No, right now.

149
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,550
我需要买件新衣服今晚穿
I obviously need something to wear tonight.

150
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,570
好  我和你一起去
Oh, okay. I'll go with you.

151
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,700
多好的主意  去吧  好好玩一天
What a great idea. Go! Make a day of it.

152
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,830
不行  等一下
No, wait, wait, wait --

153
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,020
我不能穿在家穿的高跟鞋去商场
I can't go to the mall wearing my house heels.

154
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,300
那不正是买新鞋的好理由吗
What a good excuse to buy a nice pair of new ones.

155
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,210
这就是为什么我这么爱你
That's why I love you.

156
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,250
什么时候都别忘了这点
Always remember that.

157
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,270
太感谢您了  派太太
Thank you so much, Mrs. Pasternak.

158
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,350
我想您肯定很好奇我为什么向您要骨灰吧
I'm sure you're wondering why I want these ashes.

159
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,270
并没有
Not really,

160
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,950
但你得把骨灰瓮还给我
but I'm gonna need the urn back.

161
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,550
我要把它改造成台灯
I'm gonna turn it into a lamp.

162
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,070
-你好啊  米奇尔  -天啊
- Hello, Mitchell. - Oh, God!

163
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,980
你没事吧
Is everything okay?

164
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,990
你看起来"灰"头土脸的
You're looking a little ashen.

165
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,200
我没事  我不小心把猪莉莉的骨灰弄撒了
I'm fine. I-I-I accidentally spilled pig Lily's ashes,

166
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,580
我本来打算
and I-I thought that I would --

167
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,260
你打算用派先生的骨灰偷梁换柱
You would just replace them with Morris Pasternak's?

168
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,990
你怎么知道
How'd you know?

169
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,730
他的毕业戒指就在你脚边
His class ring is by your foot.

170
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,060
那只宠物猪曾是我最好的朋友
Oh, yeah. ‭That pig was my best friend.

171
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,390
她妈不是被你吃掉的吗
Didn't you eat her mother?

172
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,510
你根本毫不尊重那些对我重要的事物
You know, you have no respect for anything that's important to me.

173
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,340
我的整个成长过程对你而言就是个大笑话
My whole upbringing is just a big joke to you.

174
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,160
大爸  我刚刚在想今晚的猪月葬礼
Dad, I was thinking about the Pig Moon funeral tonight

175
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,050
还有猪莉莉对你有多重要
and how important Lily was to you.

176
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,270
你太贴心了
Aww, that is so sweet.

177
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,760
你绝对继承了她的同情心
You definitely inherited her compassion.

178
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,690
你记得我画的那幅猪莉莉的手指画吗
Remember that finger painting that I made of her,

179
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,850
你说够格在博物馆展出的那幅
the one that you said that was museum quality?

180
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,950
能把画和骨灰一起下葬吗
Can we bury it with her?

181
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,210
我清楚记得画在哪
I know exactly where it is.

182
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,490
我清楚记得画本来在哪
I know exactly where it was.

183
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,220
是我母校给卢克发来的电邮
It's an e-mail for Luke from my alma mater.

184
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,480
-快把他叫来  -先别
- Let's get him! - ‭Oh, no, no!

185
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,660
别叫  万一是坏消息呢
No, what if it's more bad news?

186
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,440
或许你该先读一下
Maybe you should read it first.

187
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,270
克莱尔  我和你一样等不及想知道
Claire, I am as anxious as you are

188
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,160
他会不会和他爸一样成为斗牛犬的一员
to find out if he's gonna be a Bulldog like his old man,

189
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,000
但我们不能侵犯他对我们的信任
but we can't violate his trust.

190
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,370
虽然我们可以重新标记为未读来湮灭证据
Sure, we could mark it as unread to cover our tracks,

191
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,290
但我们心知肚明...
but we'd know --

192
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,250
他没被录取
He didn't get in.

193
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,620
什么  他比别人都强
What?! He's a legacy!

194
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,540
斗牛犬对他垂涎三尺
Bulldog drool courses through his jowls!

195
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,740
我知道  而且这是他第七次被拒了
I know, and it's his seventh rejection.

196
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,630
他会特别失望的
He's gonna be so disappointed.

197
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,760
也会难堪  我们今晚在杰家聚餐
And embarrassed. We have that dinner at Jay's tonight.

198
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,240
我打赌曼尼被所有学校录取了
I bet Manny got in everywhere.

199
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,390
老天
Oh, God.

200
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,030
到此为止了吗
Is this it?

201
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,850
卢克上不成大学了吗
I mean, is Luke not going to college?

202
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,870
还没完
It's not over.

203
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,460
删除
Delete.

204
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,130
你要做什么
What are you doing?

205
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,150
我要开车去那里  告诉他们这是错误的决定
I'm driving up there to tell them they made a mistake.

206
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,020
收一个像卢克这样的学生是他们走运
They'd be lucky to have a kid like Luke.

207
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,460
应该坏不到哪里去
Well, I guess it -- it can't hurt.

208
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,740
他们又不能"超级"拒收
I mean, it's not like they can super reject him.

209
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,210
虽然密歇根大学的确用了这词
Although, Michigan did use that exact term.

210
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,420
这里是96.3潮流台  我们是迪亚哥与傻驴
You're on Caliente 96.3 with Diego and The Donkey.

211
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,580
你好  太棒了
Hello! Yes!

212
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,990
我打来是想获得格洛丽亚·埃斯特凡的票
I'm calling about the Gloria Estefan tickets.

213
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,990
只要你能接上下面的歌词  票就归你了
And they're all yours if you can complete this lyric --

214
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,490
扭转"啥啥"
"Turn the blank around."

215
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,020
她在90年代最火的歌之一
One of her biggest hits from the '90s.

216
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,320
我们今早一直在放
We've been playing it all morning.

217
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,720
-"扭转车..."  -不对  还有两次机会
- "Turn the car around." - Nope. Two more guesses.

218
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,650
"扭转船"
"Turn the boat around."

219
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,110
再试一次
Try again.

220
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,950
"扭转经济"
"Turn the economy around"!

221
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,510
你个蠢驴
You're an ass.

222
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:49,940
靠
Damn it!

223
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,910
我被密歇根大学"超级录取"了
I just got super accepted to Michigan.

224
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,500
他是迪尔加多家族第二个上大学的人
He's the second Delgado to go to college.

225
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,970
我表哥去了哥伦比亚最好的医学院
My cousin went to the best medical school in Colombia.

226
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,030
那里可不是什么尸体都收的
They would not just accept any cadaver.

227
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,020
行了  妈  我们走
Okay, Mom, let's go.

228
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,910
好  不过先等下
Oh, yeah, but wait.

229
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,010
还记得你脑袋这么小的时候吗
You remember when your head was this tiny?

230
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,470
行了  妈  我已经挑好帽子了
Okay. Mom, Mom, I think I'm set for hats.

231
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,830
女人想大哭时  我看得出来
I know when a female's about to burst into tears.

232
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,500
我看过够多次了
I've seen it enough times.

233
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,670
我得让我妈远离
I had to keep my mom away

234
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,050
任何会让她想到我要离开的东西
from anything that reminded her I was moving away

235
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,300
也让我自己远离厨房用品店
and keep myself away from Williams Sonoma.

236
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,660
我可能会耗掉整个下午在里面
I could lose an afternoon.

237
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,910
宠物店  又萌又有趣
A pet store. These are fun.

238
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,450
我觉得它想妈妈了
I think he misses his mommy.

239
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,400
我们走到车边时它估计就忘掉妈妈吗
He'll forget about her by the time we get to the car.

240
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,910
再一想  我们去看电影吧
On second thought, let's catch a movie.

241
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,900
电影总能让人忘了烦恼
They always help keep your mind off of things.

242
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,980
{\an8}噗  我娶了我妈

243
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,580
等等  警官  不要
Wait, Officer -- No!

244
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,680
我的车停在这里是因为我是负责任的人
My car is only here because I was being responsible!

245
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,950
我负责照看我舅乔
I was babysitting my uncle Joe

246
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,650
结果喝得太醉不能开车回家了
and got too drunk to drive home!

247
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,520
这是什么鬼东西
What is this thing?!

248
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,590
挡风玻璃锁
The Barnacle.

249
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,480
没交停车罚单  警察就把它贴你车上
They stick it on your car when you have unpaid parking tickets.

250
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,740
我不能让爸妈看到
I couldn't let my parents see it,

251
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,110
因为我知道他们会小题大做
because I knew they'd just overreact

252
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,230
给我讲一堆要负责的大道理
and lecture me about being irresponsible,

253
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,370
我也不能付罚单移除这东西
and I couldn't pay to remove it

254
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,690
因为我刚刷爆了信用卡
because I just maxed out my credit card

255
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,210
买了副超贵的太阳镜
on these insanely expensive pair of sunglasses.

256
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,920
我也不想
I don't love 'em.

257
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,090
我只要重新画一张莉莉的猪莉莉画
I just had to re-create Lily's painting of Pig Lily,

258
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,950
她就不会知道那件事
and she'd be none the wiser.

259
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,200
天  就像用香肠画画似的
Oh, it's like painting with sausages.

260
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,300
抱歉  小卡  这里没有莉莉画的小猪画
Sorry, Cam, no pig painting by Lily here.

261
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,430
不过有一些涂鸦
I do have some random scribbles

262
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,980
是卢克还小的时候画...
that Luke made when he was...

263
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,510
好像是比我希望的岁数还大些时画的
Huh, that's a little later than I'd hoped.

264
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,620
好  这事绝不能告诉米奇尔
Fine. Not a word of this to Mitchell.

265
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,010
我知道你好奇原因
I'm sure you're curious why.

266
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,900
你又错了
Wrong again.

267
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,870
你是第一个到的
Hi. You're the first one here.

268
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,920
别担心  我们不必闲聊的
Don't worry. We don't have to make conversation.

269
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,030
剪贴簿
Ooh! A scrapbook!

270
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,690
瞧瞧
Aww, look at this.

271
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,730
我们小时候的学校作业都在
All of our old school projects --

272
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,730
我和克莱尔画的画
paintings by me and Claire.

273
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,040
你就是个豆腐心啊
Aww! You're just a big softie, aren't 'cha?

274
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,960
我律师的秘书整的
My lawyer's secretary put that together

275
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,780
为了我在离婚法庭上的形象
for my image at the divorce trial.

276
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,520
还是原来强硬的熊爸
There's the old bear. Grr!

277
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,400
这是我八岁生日时照的
Oh, this is from my 8th birthday.

278
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,410
我让妈给我办了场农场主题的派对
I made Mom throw a party with a whole farm theme.

279
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,570
猜怎么着  我需要这张照片
You know what? I need this.

280
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,300
小卡觉得我看不起他的农场生活
Cam thinks I look down on his farm life.

281
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,770
-这能证明给他看...  -停停停
- This'll prove to him that... - Bup, bup, bup.

282
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,750
要照片得付出代价
This comes with a price.

283
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,640
你能给我弄到格洛丽亚·埃斯特凡的票吧
You can get me Gloria Estefan tickets, right?

284
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
爸  这话有点冒犯人
Dad, that is offensive.

285
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,840
不是所有同性恋都跟她有交情
Not every gay person is connected to Gloria Estefan.

286
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,860
但你有  对吧
But you are, right?

287
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,420
情况很复杂
It's complicated.

288
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,780
小卡曾和格洛丽亚·埃斯特凡的
Cam briefly dated a member

289
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,410
迈阿密之音乐队的一员约过会
of Gloria Estefan's band, The Miami Sound Machine.

290
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,110
他不常提起
He doesn't talk about it much.

291
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,010
也就有人提到她或迈阿密就说吧
Just whenever someone mentions her or Miami.

292
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,570
还有湿度
Or humidity.

293
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,770
就这样
Well...

294
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,070
一手给票  一手给照片
when I get the tickets, you get the picture.

295
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,420
小气
Mean!

296
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,570
你愿不愿意请小卡动用他的关系
Um, how would you feel about asking Cam to use his connections

297
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,640
弄到两张今晚看格洛丽亚·埃斯特凡的票
to get two Gloria Estefan tickets for tonight

298
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,080
然后偷偷给我
and then secretly giving them to me?

299
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,840
我愿意做
I'll do it,

300
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,340
但你要先帮我办车的事
but I need you to help me with my car first.

301
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,650
我可以找我爸妈  但...
I'd ask my parents, but --

302
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,230
他们不会理解  这不是你的错
They wouldn't understand. It's not your fault.

303
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,390
行  我们快去
Yeah. Okay. Let's go.

304
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,580
你确定这是最好的办法吗
Are we sure this is the best way to do this?

305
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,430
我们只需要确保我爸妈不会看到它
All we have to do is make sure that my parents don't see it

306
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,410
我们往前开点就行了
by moving it down the street.

307
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,950
-懂吗  抓好  -我就是你的眼
- Okay? Hold on. - I'm your eyes.

308
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,900
沿着路边
Hug the curb.

309
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,540
海莉...  好吧  直着开
Haley, just -- all right. Straighten out.

310
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,770
开启危险警告灯
T-Turn on your hazards.

311
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,850
-那是雨刷  -你踩到我腿了  挪开
- That's the windshield wiper! - You're on my leg! Move!

312
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,310
天啊  有棵树...
Oh, God! There's a tree.

313
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,400
好吧
All right.

314
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,360
我们先喘口气  等一下
Let's just breathe, let's take a moment...

315
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,400
你能从我腿上挪开吗
Can you just get off my leg, please?

316
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,690
对不...  我没有...
I'm not -- I'm s-- I'm not --

317
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,600
-我们在往后吗  -你挂了倒车档
- Are we going backwards? - You put us in reverse.

318
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,680
踩刹车
Okay, hit the brake.

319
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,240
那是油门
That is the gas!

320
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,990
你驾照是怎么考的啊
How do you have a license?!

321
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,240
我动不了  你压到我腿了
I can't move! You're on my leg!

322
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,290
好了  第一次尝试还不错
Okay. Good first try.

323
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,290
不敢相信你不来杯斗牛犬冰沙
Can't believe you didn't treat yourself to a Bulldog Blast.

324
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,890
那不就是糖  冰
Isn't that basically just sugar, ice,

325
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,230
还有用来涂蓝人乐队的蓝油漆吗
and the stuff they you use to cover the Blue Man Group?

326
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,680
我们来见招生办主任
We're here to see the Dean of Admissions.

327
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,090
我们来过电话  邓菲家
We called. We're the Dunphys.

328
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,770
我会告诉欣登主任你们到了
Ah. I'll tell Dean Hinden you're here.

329
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,270
欣登吗
Um, eh -- Hinden?

330
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,100
是的  鲁道夫·欣登主任
Yes. Dean Rudolf Hinden.

331
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,860
我有不好的感觉
I have a bad feeling.

332
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,420
亲爱的  你的确刚喝了那像防冻剂的饮料
Well, honey, you did just have two of those antifreezes.

333
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,320
不是啦
No.

334
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,450
鲁迪·欣登  我们曾是同学
Rudy Hinden -- We were classmates.

335
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,900
超烦人  总是很亢奋
Super annoying -- always "on."

336
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,140
我们都是拉拉队的  一起玩蹦床
We cheered together, we -- we tumbled together,

337
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,440
一起四处玩
we rolled around together,

338
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,970
但我们关系从不亲密
but we were never close.

339
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,590
我说斗牛  你说犬
When I say "Bull," you say "Dog"!

340
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,750
-斗牛  -犬
- Bull! - ‭Dog!

341
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,660
-斗牛  -犬
- Bull! - ‭Dog!

342
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,440
你好  鲁迪
‭Hey, Rudy!

343
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,260
这位是我太太克莱尔
This is my wife Claire.

344
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,360
-你好  -很荣幸
- Hi. - ‭Pleasure.

345
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,820
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

346
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,700
快请进吧
Well, please come on in.

347
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,580
-蹦床不错啊  -谢谢
- Oh! Great trampoline. - ‭Thanks.

348
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,890
我习惯每天跳至少20分钟
I like to bounce at least 20 minutes a day.

349
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,370
-我的好点子都是在蹦跳中产生的  -好吧
- It's where I get my best ideas. - ‭Okay.

350
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,370
真是个怪人啊
How quirky.

351
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:04,900
对了  菲尔
Oh, hey, Phil,

352
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,190
当年的高年级比赛在哪里举行
where were Nationals senior year?

353
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,700
克利夫兰  俄"嗨"俄州
Cleveland, Oh-- Hi-o!

354
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,160
你能想象忍受这种怪胎
Can you imagine putting up with this

355
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,100
-很多年的心情吗  -的确很难
- for years on end? - It's hard.

356
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,820
这样吧  我去跳一会找灵感
Tell you what, I'll give it some bounce time

357
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,590
回头给你答复
and hit you back with an answer.

358
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,880
你好像挺忙的
Listen, you seem busy.

359
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,810
那我就直说了
I'll get straight to it.

360
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,220
我们儿子卢克申请了这里  但没被录取
Our son Luke applied and didn't get in,

361
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,330
我觉得你可以再考虑一下
and I think it's worth reconsidering.

362
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,640
他是个好孩子  只是大器晚成
He's a great kid. He's just a late bloomer.

363
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,080
好的  我应该能帮你儿子搞定这事
Okay. I think we can make something happen for your boy.

364
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,410
真的吗
Really?

365
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,840
是啊  比他更糟糕的学生我们也录取过了
Yeah, we've let in way worse applicants than him.

366
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,820
-鲁迪  -什...
- Rudy! - Wha--

367
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,960
-太谢谢了  你最木奉棒了  -是啊
- Thank you! You're the B-E-S-T best! - ‭Yeah.

368
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,670
不客气
No problemo.

369
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,800
我只要...
I'll just, uh...

370
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,120
对了
Hey.

371
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,840
既然你都来了
While you're here,

372
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,690
有件事我一直想问你
I've always wanted to ask you something.

373
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,370
你还记得以前你常表演的那个魔术吗
You remember that magic trick you used to do

374
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,730
就是你蒙着眼从紧身服里挣脱出来那个
where you got out of a straitjacket blindfolded?

375
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,550
巴纳姆骗局
Barnum's Humbug.

376
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,230
对  就是那个
Yeah. That one.

377
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,870
你是怎么做到的
How'd you do it?

378
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,640
用魔法  我觉得应该...
Magic. I-I feel like --

379
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,270
不不不  说真的
No, no, no, really --

380
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,700
我已经试图破解这个魔术好几年了
I've been trying to figure it out for years.

381
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,340
很抱歉
Um, I'm sorry.

382
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,690
按照惯例
It's -- It's not customary

383
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,000
魔术师不可以透露自己的手法
for a magician to reveal his secrets.

384
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,600
按照惯例  招生办主任也不应该
It's also not "customary" for a Dean of Admissions

385
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,110
修改申请人的录取状态  所以...
to alter an applicant's status, so...

386
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,410
我去护士那里拿紧身服过来
I'll go get the straitjacket from the nurse.

387
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,830
你会照做的吧
You're gonna do it, right?

388
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,150
我不知道
I don't know.

389
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,290
让我蹦一会想想
Let me bounce on it.

390
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,080
菲尔
Phil.

391
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:20,970
亲爱的
Sweetheart?

392
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,630
菲尔  亲爱的  这件事情
Phil. Honey, Phil, you can't possibly

393
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,780
你还有什么好挣扎的
be struggling with this decision.

394
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,000
你知道透露魔术手法的魔术师
Do you know what happens to magicians

395
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,640
会有什么下场吗  克莱尔
who reveal their secrets, Claire?

396
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,420
会被唾弃  会被孤立
They're shunned.

397
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,960
现实不已经是这样了吗
Doesn't that happen already?

398
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,060
我掌握的知识
Listen, I possess knowledge

399
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,950
可是由古埃及巫师
passed down from the ancient Egyptian conjurers

400
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,550
传给黑暗时代的变戏法人
to the prestidigitators of the Dark Ages

401
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,420
再传到今天的业余魔术师手上
to the amateur illusionists of today.

402
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,660
我担心的是另一个戏法
I am worried about another trick.

403
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,450
我正努力把我们儿子"变"到
I am trying to make our son disappear

404
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,970
一所勉强合格的四年制大学里
to a barely accredited four-year college.

405
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,220
-他来了  -好了  我拿来了
- There he is. - Okay, here we are.

406
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,910
你快点穿上吧
Why don't you go ahead and put these on.

407
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,390
不不不  就在这里穿
No, no, no. In here.

408
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,940
我想确保我能学会
I want to make sure I get this.

409
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,630
我要看到一切细节
I want to see everything.

410
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,580
好吧
‭Okay.

411
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,600
好  我帮你拿着
Okay, I got it.

412
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,000
我当时还没意识到我叫菲尔做的事有多严重
I didn't quite grasp what I was asking Phil to do,

413
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,710
不过...
but, um...

414
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,060
后来越变越怪了
it got weird.

415
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,170
好了
Okay.

416
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,370
好  你准备好就随时可以开始
All right. Whenever you're ready.

417
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,270
等等  这不会被放到网上吧
Wait, th-this isn't going on the Internet, is it?

418
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,430
不会  我自己看而已
No, it's just for me.

419
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,660
这套逃脱术的诀窍是
The challenge with this escape

420
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,470
按正确顺序解开锁链
is, uh, releasing the shackles in the correct order

421
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,550
再慢慢从中挣脱出来
baring yourself gradually.

422
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,440
-再欢乐一点  要说台词  -什么
- Okay, more upbeat. Do the patter. - What?

423
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,810
我想听以前那套台词
I want to hear the old patter.

424
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,430
蒙住他的眼睛
Blindfold him.

425
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,710
-拿着  -是  长官
- Take it. - ‭Yes...sir.

426
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,650
菲尔
Phil.

427
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,340
亲爱的  你不必这么做
Honey, you don't have to do this.

428
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,530
大不了卢克可以去参军
Luke can join the army.

429
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,350
没关系
It's okay.

430
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,740
肉体虽被困住  但我心是自由的
I may be locked up, but my mind is free.

431
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,700
好了
Okay.

432
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,610
想象你正在一个博物馆里
Imagine yourself in a museum

433
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,810
里面摆满了来自世界各地的奇异之物
filled with the world's oddities.

434
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,080
不不不  慢一点说
No, no, no, no. Slow down.

435
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,140
享受过程
Enjoy it.

436
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,100
转过去
And turn around

437
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,910
我要看清楚背面
so I can get a good look at the back.

438
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,520
让我看背面
Let me see the back.

439
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,360
屏息以待
Behold the freak

440
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,880
奇事即将发生
for all to see.

441
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,550
帮我拿到门票
Go get my tickets.

442
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,480
我头发是不是很塌
Is my hair a mess?

443
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,520
今天外面好潮湿
It's so humid out.

444
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,370
你想讨论湿度吗
You want to talk about humidity?

445
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,860
我曾经跟迈阿密之音乐队的
I once spent a steamy weekend

446
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,240
一位成员共度了一个很"湿"的周末
with a certain member of the Miami Sound Machine.

447
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,540
太巧了吧
‭That's crazy!

448
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,400
-你知道他们今晚就在城里吗  -什么
- Do you know that they're in town tonight? - What?

449
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,970
你能帮我弄两张票吗
Can you get me two tickets?

450
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,130
天啊
Oh, my God.

451
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,010
这双玉手
These hands --

452
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,800
如此精致小巧  像孩子的手一样
they're so small and delicate like a child.

453
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,730
我知道
I know.

454
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,580
这块手表本来是芭比娃娃戴的
This watch came from an American Girl doll.

455
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,340
-你到底能不能帮我搞到票  -可以
- Are you gonna hook me up or what? - ‭Yes, yes.

456
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,560
但你得先用那双小手
Just as soon as you and your tiny little hands

457
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,140
帮我重画一幅画
re-create a painting for me.

458
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,270
这边请
This way.

459
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,310
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

460
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,820
我追求的是阴暗神秘高冷风
I was going for dark and mysterious,

461
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,250
但恐怕还是回到了
but I'm afraid I circled right back

462
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,590
可爱亲切暖男风
to cute and approachable.

463
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,560
她真幸运
Oh, she's so lucky.

464
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,910
他永远都会是她的小宝贝
He's always gonna be her little boy.

465
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,830
妈  你把自己的心情投射到假人身上了
Mom, you're projecting on these mannequins.

466
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,410
说不定他是个侏儒
For all we know, he's a little person,

467
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,890
而这位是他的老婆  有足够成熟的心
and that's his wife who's evolved enough

468
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,490
能看到他内心有多么高大
to see how big he is on the inside.

469
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,200
曼尼  我知道你这一整天
Manny, I know what you've been

470
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,280
都在打什么主意
trying to do the whole day.

471
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,890
我不会因为你要去上大学
I am not about to have a breakdown

472
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,290
就精神崩溃
because you're going to college.

473
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,460
你昨晚帮我梳头的时候  我其实没睡着
I was awake last night when you were brushing my hair.

474
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,030
好吧  我的确是会很难受
Okay, yes, it's going to be hard

475
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,560
因为你要去很远的地方
because you're gonna be far away,

476
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,160
我就不能常常见到你了
so I'm not gonna get to see you all the time.

477
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,710
但我们还是会打电话啊
But we'll still talk on the phone.

478
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,730
一开始会
Yeah, at the beginning,

479
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,760
但接着你就会忙学业
but then you're gonna get busy,

480
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,740
我也有自己的事要忙
and then I am going to get busy.

481
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,350
你会忙到接不了我的电话吗
Too busy to take my calls?

482
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,650
我已经想通了
I have made peace with it.

483
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,770
你的童年时期已经结束了
Your childhood days are over.

484
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,670
吉列尔莫  回来
Guillermo, come back here!

485
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,280
你在做什么
What are you doing?

486
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,800
不要从你母亲身边跑走
Don't run away from your mother.

487
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,170
很快生活就会迫使你们分别
Life is going to tear you apart soon enough.

488
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,120
我想去坐旋转木马
I want to go on the merry-go-round.

489
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,160
你的人生就是走马灯
Oh, you're on it.

490
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,400
你和她只剩下十年的相处时间了
You've got 10 years left with that woman.

491
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,930
珍惜这段时间  珍惜她
Cherish them. Cherish her.

492
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,370
谢谢
Thanks?

493
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,400
似乎我才是因为要上大学而慌张的那个人
I think maybe I'm freaking out about going to school.

494
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,330
我看到了
I see that.

495
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,300
但我们会没事的
But we're gonna be okay.

496
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,100
我们的分离只会让每个夜晚像今晚一样精彩
Being apart is just gonna make nights like tonight,

497
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,150
去看演唱会  或者有更特别的安排
going to a concert, even more special.

498
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,030
-不  -吉列尔莫
- No! ‭- Guillermo!

499
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,180
我不想去
I don't want to!

500
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,590
这死小孩只是没家教罢了
Okay, now it's just bad parenting.

501
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,660
这活儿太好了
This is excellent work.

502
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,660
-太棒了  -真的吗
- Excellent work. - ‭Really?

503
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,570
好不习惯听到这话啊
I'm not used to hearing that.

504
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,950
终于懂别人做事为何会努力了
I get why people try now.

505
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,100
那是我的画吗
Is that my painting?

506
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,140
为什么在这里
Why is it here?

507
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,310
因为之前被借走了
Um, oh, well, because it was on loan

508
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,370
你祖父祖母借去摆了
to your grandma and grandpa

509
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,890
他们也这么借真艺术品
just like they do with real art.

510
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,500
比这家里大多数的艺术品强多了
Better than most of the stuff in this house.

511
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,590
给我去弄格洛丽亚·埃斯特巴的票
Now get me those Gloria Esteban tickets.

512
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,960
是埃斯特凡
It's Estefan.

513
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,530
我就是这么说的啊  我可是脑残粉
That's what I said. I'm a huge fan.

514
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,310
好吧
Okay.

515
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,310
卡洛斯  卡洛斯
Carlos, Carlos.

516
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,180
你好  卡洛斯
Hey -- hey, Carlos.

517
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,260
我是卡梅隆·塔克
Um, this, uh, Cameron Tucker.

518
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,560
我也不确定你还记不记得我
I don't know if you remember me or not.

519
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,190
你...  你记得啊
Oh, you -- you do.

520
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,240
好久不见啊
Okay, hi.

521
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,760
我能不能麻烦你帮我弄几张
Yeah, wondering if I could get a couple tickets

522
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,150
今晚演出的票
for the show tonight.

523
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,450
格洛丽亚·埃斯特凡
Gloria Estefan.

524
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,880
因为你是迈阿密之音乐队的成员啊  傻子
Because you're in the Miami Sound Machine, silly.

525
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,270
什么
What?

526
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,140
我遇到卡洛斯的那晚  酒吧很吵
It was loud in the bar the night I met Carlos,

527
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,880
结果发现他并不是
and it turns out he is not a member

528
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,270
那个传奇乐队  迈阿密之音的成员
of the legendary band, the Miami Sound Machine.

529
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,550
他有一个狗狗美容车的生意
He owns a mobile dog grooming business

530
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,780
名叫"迈阿狗之净"
called Miami's Hound Machine.

531
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,330
现在一看  我当时不该因他拥有
In retrospect, I didn't need to be as alarmed

532
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,270
这么多绳索与颈圈而起戒心
with his collection of leashes and collars.

533
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,290
大伙们聚过来
Okay, everybody, gather round.

534
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,140
卢克还有一家大学的回复没看
Luke has one more college to hear from,

535
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,000
我感觉这家挺有戏呢
and I got a good feeling about this one.

536
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,730
对啊
Yeah.

537
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,100
妈  我们能别在这里看吗
Mom, can we not do this here?

538
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,650
没事啦  要有点信心
Oh, come on, have a little faith.

539
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,930
礼炮已备好  开始录制
Okay, cannon's ready. And record.

随时开始  小家伙
Any time, buddy.

542
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,680
好啦各位
All right, everyone,

543
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,790
准备好安慰我天生我材必有用
get ready to tell me how I'm my own kind of smart

544
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,680
老天爷自有安排
and how everyone takes their own path.

545
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,840
天生我材必有用  老天...
You're a different kind of smart, and everyone...

546
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,470
必有用  老天爷自有安排
Kind of smart. Everybody takes their own path.

547
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,320
我被录取啦
I got in?

548
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,520
什么  他进啦
What?! He got in!

549
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,820
他进啦
He got in!

550
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,460
你进啦  这玩意什么毛病
You got in! ‭What is wrong with this thing?

551
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,510
等等  这不科学啊
Wait, this doesn't make any sense.

552
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,510
我都被更差的学校拒绝过了
I got rejected by worse schools than this.

553
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,580
他们为什么会要收我啊
Why would they want me?

554
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,850
人家为什么会不要你
Why wouldn't they want you?

555
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,370
宝贝  不只是学术成绩重要啊
Honey, it's not all about grades.

556
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,140
你还参加了很多...
I mean, you were involved in -- in...

557
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,420
你们跟学校谈过了吗
Did you talk to them?

558
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,280
你说什么  没听清
I'm sorry, what?

559
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,520
舌头伸出来给我看
Show me your tongue.

560
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,280
我伸舌头又能证明什么呢
I don't know what that would prove.

561
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,460
这感觉是个尴尬的家庭时刻  
This kind of seems like an embarrassing family moment. 

562
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
已经在录了
I know, I'm on it.

563
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,220

去过那学校的人
You can't go to that campus

565
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,370
肯定都尝过他们的斗牛犬冰沙
without getting a Bulldog Blast.

566
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,200
我们是去告诉他们  不录取你是错误
We went up there to tell them they made a mistake.

567
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,360
他们并没有犯错误
They didn't make a mistake,

568
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,960
其他不要我的学校也没有做错
and neither did the other schools.

569
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,780
我不会去上的
I'm not going.

570
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,350
宝贝  这是你最后的机会了
Honey, it's your last chance.

571
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,800
那我就明年再去上

572
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,510
-要去  就得是正大光明进去  -这话我服

573
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,810
没人让你提供意见  谢谢
Nobody asked for your opinion, thank you.

574
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,570
你必须得去上
You're going.

575
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,990
你完全不知道你爸爸费了多大功夫
You have no idea what your father went through

576
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,090
才为你弄到这机会
to get you this opportunity.

577

以你无法想象到的方式牺牲自己人格
He debased himself in ways you can't imagine.

578
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,900
你不是说没多严重吗
You said it wasn't that bad.

579
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,340
你在看什么
What are you watching?

580
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,830
我们的邻居发给我个视频
Our neighbor sent me a video.

581
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,110
是海莉跟米奇尔
It's of Haley and Mitchell.

582
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,430
不是  那是...  不需要放出...
Oh. No, that's -- okay, we don't need to...

583
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:16,980
太久了吧
It's taking forever.

584
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,390
我已经用全身力气推了
I'm pushing as hard as I can. 

585
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,150
你的挡风玻璃被人安上那东西了吗
You have one of those things on your windshield?

586
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,470
你收到了多少张停车罚单啊
How many parking tickets do you have?

587
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,450
我觉得现在焦点不应该在我啊
I think we're focused on the wrong thing here.

588
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,130
卢克不去上大学了呢
Luke's not going to college.

589
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,410
你的手指为什么是粉色的
Why is your finger pink?

590
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,450
这不是我画的
This isn't mine.

591
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,990
我就觉得作图视角怪怪的
I knew the perspective was off.

592
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,830
是小卡的错
It's Cam's fault.

593
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,490
他让我看着照片做出来的
He made me copy it from a photo.

594
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,760
是这样的  我不小心毁了原件
You know what? I accidentally destroyed the original,

595
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,770
我心里又过意不去
and I couldn't live without it.

596
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,680
米奇尔·普里契特  我代表"育儿杂志"提问

伪造孩子的画就有比用派太太亡夫骨灰
How is forging a child's painting any less egregious

598
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,870
来替换猪的骨灰强到哪里去吗

599
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,790
没有
It's not.

600
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,840
我就是个伪君子  我的一生充满谎言

601
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,750
卡洛斯并不是迈阿密之音的团员
Carlos isn't really in the Miami Sound Machine.

602
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,660
他只是个...  普通的狗狗美容师

603
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,690
把钱省下来吧  我不能帮你弄到票
Save your money. I couldn't get you your tickets.

604
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,860
你花钱去买票
You're spending money on tickets

605
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,440
而不是花钱去付掉罚票[单]吗...
when you should be spending money on ticket --

606
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,580
你懂我的意思
you know what I mean.

607

演唱会的票是帮米奇尔弄的
The concert tickets were for Mitchell.

608
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,970
-所以你没帮我搞来门票吗  -没有
- So you didn't get my tickets? - ‭No.

609
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,670
-你没帮我买到票啊  -那网站像神经病
- So you didn't get my tickets. - The website was insane.

610
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,420
没有猫鼬般的反应速度根本抢不到
You'd need the reflexes of a mongoose.

611
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,630
你骗了我
You lied to me.

612
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,720
看看大家  谁都在说谎
Well, look around! Everybody's lying.

613
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,330
伪造画作  盲眼开车
Forging paintings, driving blind,

614
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,500
偷换骨灰
swapping ashes.

615
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,630
我不想毁了你的猪月嘛
I didn't want to ruin the Pig Moon.

616
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,590
没有什么猪月好吗
There is no Pig Moon.

617
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,240
你是觉得我密苏里老家有多落后啊
How backwards do you think Grasshopper, Missouri is?

618
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,350
大家听我说  我能解决
Guys, guys. I've got this.

619
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,230
各位
Guys.

620
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,860
我打给塔格法官了
I talked to Judge Tager.

621
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,910
他同意撤销你的罚单
He'll make your parking tickets disappear

622
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,110
代价是给他来俩上好古巴雪茄
in return for a couple of Cubans.

623
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,300
你拿了三根
You took three.

624
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,970
另一根是给俱乐部的保安的
The other one is for the security guard at the club.

625
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,070
他今晚在埃斯特凡的演唱会兼职保安
He moonlights where Estefan's playing tonight.

626
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,720
你们到时候入口见
He'll meet you by the stage door.

627
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,400
谢谢你帮杰圆了谎
Thank you for fixing Jay's lies.

628
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,560
我们都对说出实话感到棘手
We all struggle with the truth.

629
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,070
就像上周四我帮你把杰拖在俱乐部
like last Thursday when I stalled Jay at the club

630
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,950
好让你有时间把乔弄出狗门
so you could get Joe out of the doggy door.

631
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,100
她不小心把我俩锁门外了  而瓦斯炉又没关
She locked us out, and the stove was on.

632
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,700
-至于你们两个  -你有认识人能帮忙吗
- And you two. - You know a guy at a club that can help us?

633
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,640
没有  你们多谈谈就行了
No. Just talk more.

634
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,280
你们9成的问题
90% of your problems would be solved

635
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,980
都只需要多谈谈就能解决
if you just discussed things.

636
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,490
家里的范德考夫沙发是山寨货
The Vanderkoff is a knock-off.

637
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,740
我不小心把山寨货烫出了个洞
I burnt a hole in the knock-off,

638
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,090
所以买了个新的真品替换
and I had replaced it with a real one.

639
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,790
好了  所有问题都解决了
Okay, everything's settled here.

640
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,030
我觉得牛排好了  我们去吃饭吧
I think the steaks are ready. Let's go eat.

641
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,610
看来我们的儿子

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,420
今年是不会去上大学了
isn't going to college this year.

643
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,610
是啊  而我们本来应该很担心他
I know, and I know we're supposed to be worried about him.

644
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,360
但你看到他刚才做的了吗
But do you see what he just did,

645
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,760
他怎么帮大家解决问题
how he solved everybody's problems like that?

646
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,170
还挺厉害的吧
It's pretty incredible, right?

647
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,790
他是个邓菲家的好男儿啊  克莱尔
That's a Dunphy man, Claire --

648

足智多谋  临危不乱

649
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,420
以及恰到好处的随机应变力

650
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,190
我...  我们厨房见
I'll, uh -- I'll see you in the kitchen.

651
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,100
所以这是真的范德考夫沙发啊
So this is a real Vanderkoff.

652
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,070
对啊  从这秘密中解放出来太爽了
Yeah, yeah. Feels good to finally be free of that secret.

653
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,680
对啊  把事情都摊开来说感觉太好了
Yeah, it's just... great to have everything out in the open.

654
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,560
是啊
Yeah.

655
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,230
那边你买来送我的名贵油画
That expensive painting you bought me over there, 

656
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,210
我移动他是为了挡墙上我弄出来的洞
I moved it to cover up a hope I made in the wall.

657
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,370
我是在人家二手拍卖的时候花2毛5买的
I only paid 25 cents for that painting at a garage sale.

658
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,890
剩下的钱我拿去买鞋了
I used the rest of the money on shoes

659
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,030
我有做电流除毛  不然我胡子会长到这
I get electrolysis. My beard grows up to here.

660
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,030
我其实不会跳排舞
I don't really know how to line dance, 

661
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,180
所以我教你的时候  那些牛仔都在笑你
and that's why those cowboys laught at you when I taught you.

662
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,040
-那不是拉里  -那不是拉里
- That's not Larry - That's not Larry.
