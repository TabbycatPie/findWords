34
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,850
Good morning.

35
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,990
What time is it?

36
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,670
6:28.

37
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,920
You should be asleep, but I'm glad you're not.

38
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,300
Your post-op pathology and MRI results are finally in, and...

39
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,420
they're good.

40
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,670
Very good.

41
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,620
Was the pause for dramatic effect?

42
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,550
Yes.

43
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,530
The surgery was a success.

44
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,610
The only thing you need now is rest.

45
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,740
And chemo and radiation.

46
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,260
Have you been here all night?

47
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,300
I slept in a chair in the lab.

48
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,170
Well, you should go home and go to sleep.

49
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,870
I can't go home.

50
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,380
My next shift starts in 31 minutes.

51
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,700
The surgery was a success.

{\an7}BGM: Walking On Sunshine by Katrina And The Waves

53
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,870
{\an9}* I used to think maybe you loved me *

54
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,910
{\an9}* Now, baby, I'm sure *

55
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,890
{\an9}* And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door *

56
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,720
{\an9}* Now I'm walking on sunshine *

57
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,400
{\an9}* I'm walking on sunshine *

58
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,870
{\an9}* I'm walking on sunshine *

59
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,040
{\an9}* And don't it feel good? *

60
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,070
{\an9}* Hey, all right, now *

61
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,910
{\an9}* And don't it feel good? *

64
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,550
The surgery was a success.

65
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,440
All Dr. Glassman needs now is rest.

66
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,550
That's great news.

67
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,390
And chemo and radiation.

68
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,040
How are you?

69
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,930
I don't need rest.

70
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,060
I fell asleep in a comfortable chair.

71
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,650
Good. Someone screwed up the on-call schedule

72
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,240
and left the ER short-staffed.

73
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,550
I need two volunteers to fill in.

74
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,510
Good news is you won't have me breathing down your neck.

75
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,850
Bad news is it's a 36-hour shift.

76
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,500
This new flex-time policy is ridiculous.

77
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,700
Aren't our salaries low enough already?

78
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,980
It's not about the money.

79
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,650
Andrews believes that surgeons need to be at their best

80
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,140
even when they're exhausted.

81
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,450
The only way for residents to learn it is to do it.

82
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,970
You got to practice like you play.

83
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,160
And you can't do either without sleep.

84
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,310
You're free to take it up with Andrews any time.

85
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,800
Pick a number between one and five.

86
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,450
2.5
2.5.

87
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,690
- One. - That's not between...

88
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,110
- Five. - Three.

89
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,750
Aw, damn it.

90
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,190
Good news.

91
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,680
Dr. Melendez won't be breathing down our necks.

93
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,510
{\an8}You're second-year residents.

94
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,900
{\an8}This is a great opportunity for you to prove

95
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,100
that you don't need a babysitter anymore.

96
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,380
And I have a ton of personal crap I got to take care of today,

97
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,530
so I'm on call,

98
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,610
but don't call me unless you absolutely need to,

99
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,540
but you better not need to.

100
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,020
You've got a M.I. in one and compound femur in two.

101
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,540
I'm gonna kill that bastard!

102
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,870
He's dead!

103
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,040
And a bleeding, angry drunk guy in five.

104
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,290
Get your hands off of me!

105
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,580
What the hell are you looking at?!

106
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,520
Excising the endometrial lesions should only take about an hour.

107
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,200
We'll be operating through a single incision in your belly button.

108
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,080
You won't even be able to see the scar.

109
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,720
How can you operate through such a small opening?

110
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,480
It's a new technique using a single port

111
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,880
divided into sections for the camera and our tools.

112
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,710
- New? - To them.

113
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,180
Don't worry. It isn't to me.

114
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,210
I'm confident that this will resolve your pain

115
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,600
and infertility issues.

116
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,760
Thank you, all of you.

117
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,750
Being a mother is all I've ever wanted.

118
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,360
On our first date,

119
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,030
she told me the baby's name she'd picked out.

120
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,650
We were 17.

121
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,650
So let's hear 'em.

122
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,560
Jackson for a boy and Cameron for a girl.

123
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,830
Very nice. I like them.

124
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,850
So do I.

125
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,870
And you are going to be an amazing mother very soon.

126
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,510
Let's get her prepped.

127
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,990
I thought it was just because she was so pretty and, uh,

128
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,230
it had been a while,

129
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,570
but after she left, it stayed.

130
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,900
You think she roofied me with Viagra?

131
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,690
Sure. That could have happened.

132
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,990
Or maybe it was the alcohol,

133
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,940
marijuana, and Molly you pre-gamed with.

134
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,080
A lot of different drugs can cause priapism.

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,240
Especially those cooked up in a garage.

136
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,810
Is it okay if I touch it?

137
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,950
Okay.

138
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,890
Rigid corpora cavernosa and flaccid glands.

139
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,470
What's that mean? What's she getting?

140
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,320
It's been over four hours.

141
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,660
You don't want necrosis to set in.

142
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,000
N-Necrosis? Are you saying that my... My penis could die?

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,250
It could, but it won't because we're going to move fast.

144
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,430
What the hell are you going to do with that?

145
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,450
We need to remove the deoxygenated blood to restore circulation.

146
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,900
You're going to feel a small pinch and then some pressure.

147
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,950
Is she lying?

148
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,290
I'm not sure.

149
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,200
Holy mother of God, that hurts!

150
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,970
I go out for a short walk so I can have one moment of peace,

151
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,720
and this is what I come home to.

152
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,990
What's the problem?

153
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,020
His mouth was obviously big enough to get it in.

154
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,440
He must have strained his masseter.

155
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,560
It's gone into spasm and caused lockjaw.

156
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,860
So give him a sedative and pry it open with a McIvor.

157
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,960
I tried. It won't budge.

158
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,980
And he said it hurt like a son of a...

159
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,930
Inez.

160
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,360
That's what he said.

161
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,540
I put in a bite block, but I don't know...

162
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,510
Call Lim.

163
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,080
We're supposed to be proving our independence.

164
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,260
I will try again with the McIvor.

165
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,010
You don't want to tear the masseter.

166
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,820
If the bite block slips and he gags,

167
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,030
he will have broken glass and vomit in his lungs.

168
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,770
I could put him under.

169
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,710
Then I can dislocate his jaw if I have to.

170
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,720
We definitely can't do that without calling Lim.

171
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,320
That's true.

172
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,110
I hope we don't interrupt anything important.

173
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,050
Don't worry. She's either sleeping or doing laundry.

174
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,320
There's nothing interesting going on in her life.

175
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,050
Not guilty.

176
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,280
Do you have something against traffic school, ma'am?

177
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,030
Your Honor, the defendant's not eligible for traffic school.

178
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,990
This is her third moving violation in the last year.

179
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,230
Alleged violation, thank you very much.

180
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,990
Traveling 100 miles per hour on a motorcycle?

181
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,200
Do you have a death wish?

182
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,110
I wasn't going anywhere near 100.

183
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,990
So how fast were you going?

184
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,930
Excellent question.

185
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,270
And one I assure you the officer who issued my ticket

186
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,420
will not be able to answer.

187
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,380
California State Vehicle Code mandates

188
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,390
that all LIDAR speed-measurement devices be calibrated...

189
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,890
at least once a...

190
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,000
Sorry, I need to get this.

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,950
No, you need to turn it off.

192
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,390
Your Honor, I'm a trauma surgeon at St. Bonaventure,

193
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,040
and I'm on call, so...

194
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,580
Five minutes.

195
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,030
The court is adjourned for a five-minute recess.

196
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,680
I thought I was clear.

197
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,090
I'm available to help with stuff you can't do on your own.

199
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,650
Uncle Fester Jr. does not qualify.

201
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,330
{\an8}I think the situation warrants putting him under a general an...

202
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,050
And dislocating his jaw? He's not a damn snake.

203
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,520
So, what should we do?

204
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,460
Prove to me you're as capable as I think you are.

205
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,950
It doesn't make any sense.

206
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,970
We are the only hospital on the West Coast

207
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,410
that hasn't adopted the ACGME mandate

208
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,620
on a 24-hour max shift length.

209
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,770
And numerous studies have shown the negative effects

210
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,290
that sleep deprivation has on critical thinking,

211
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,980
which can cause residents to make mistakes

212
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,470
that not only harm patients, but that waste money.

213
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,940
You've done your homework.

214
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,170
Um, it's something I've been thinking about for a long time.

215
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,340
I actually did a paper on it at med school.

216
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,090
Well, Dr. Browne, I've also thought about it.

217
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,330
In fact, when the new ACGME guidelines were released,

218
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,530
I joined a nationwide study analyzing a flextime schedule.

219
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,410
It found that as long as a weekly max of 80 hours is adhered to,

220
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,190
patient outcomes and resident satisfaction scores are better

221
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,350
than at hospitals with a daily max.

222
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,520
So we're just going to have to agree to disagree

223
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,810
about whether my foolish new policies "Make any sense."

224
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,880
No, I didn't say...

225
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,000
And I know I told you to be more assertive.

226
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,530
But you also need to make sure that you don't forsake

227
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,770
your normally excellent judgment in that effort.

228
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,620
- Whether... - Excuse me. Yeah, hi, I'm sorry.

229
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,130
- I'm back. - How wonderful.

230
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,260
Take a seat until your case is called.

231
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,510
Oh, my case was called.

232
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,370
You said I could have a five-minute break.

233
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,380
The court took a five-minute break.

234
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,780
Yours is going to be considerably longer.

235
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,670
Continue.

236
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,750
Make a stab incision with an 11 blade,

237
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,180
and I'll insert the Veress.

238
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,730
He'll get over it. Don't worry.

239
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,620
Andrews just likes to hammer a nail every now and then.

240
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,670
I didn't call him a fool.

241
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,800
I just said his policy didn't make sense.

242
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,420
Insufflation's complete.

243
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,630
Ready for the multi-port.

244
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,510
You said it didn't make sense,

245
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,150
and he explained that in his opinion it did.

246
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,890
What's the problem?

247
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,870
The problem is men who tell women to be assertive,

248
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,560
then as soon as we are, they criticize us for it.

249
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,230
We're the bitch.

250
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,780
You didn't call him a fool. He didn't call you a bitch.

251
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,270
Not to her face.

252
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,740
He just suggested she choose her words more carefully.

253
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,450
So, women have to be assertive but careful?

254
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,900
When you're talking to your boss, yes. Everyone does.

255
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,000
If you're all done debating,

256
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,600
this boss could use some help.

257
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,060
You see that?

258
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,330
There are lesions on her ovary.

259
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,540
That wasn't visible on the imaging.

260
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,720
It's small.

261
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,460
We can excise it without damaging the ovary, but...

262
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,030
there are others.

263
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,980
Her bowel, bladder, uterus.

264
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,850
No wonder she's been in so much pain.

265
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,930
We'll start with the Fallopian lesions

266
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,400
just go one by one.

267
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,890
Browne, I need you to scrub out and brief the husband.

268
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,070
Explain the endometriosis is way more severe than we thought.

269
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,630
Why me? Why not Park?

270
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,230
Because I think you're better at talking to anxious relatives.

271
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,210
Is there a problem?

272
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,570
No.

273
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,500
Retract that tissue.

274
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,310
Why is she so on edge today?

275
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,910
No idea.

276
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,650
Just one of those days.

277
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,230
I didn't mean one of "Those" days.

278
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,520
I just meant, people wake up on the wrong side of the bed sometimes.

279
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,150
Dr. Browne explained exactly why she was "On edge."

280
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,550
Did you forget already,

281
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,010
or were you just not listening to begin with?

282
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,030
Excuse me?

283
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,540
We should cut back on the conversation

284
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,050
and focus on the procedure.

285
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,280
I agree.

286
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,470
I want to see her.

287
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,690
I'm sorry. You can't go into the OR.

288
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,430
I'll just... I'll just look through the window, please.

289
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,910
Daniel, trust me.

290
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,300
Seeing your beautiful wife on the operating table

291
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,510
is not gonna make you less anxious.

292
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,310
Everything is under control.

293
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,640
The only thing that's changed

294
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,630
is how long the surgery's gonna take.

295
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,600
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

296
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,250
I... I... I don't mean to be a pain.

297
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,260
You're not a pain. You're just scared.

298
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,320
I would be, too.

299
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,770
She's getting the best care possible,

300
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,000
and as soon as we're done, we'll bring you to her.

301
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,060
Thank you.

302
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,300
Okay.

303
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,690
Y-you're... you're good at this.

305
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,820
Dr. Monteo to pre-op.

306
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,850
Dr. Monteo to pre-op.

307
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,450
Shouldn't you be in the ER?

308
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,620
Lea keeps calling me.

309
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,440
She wants to talk about why I told her to go back to Hershey.

310
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,710
You told Lea to go back to Hershey?

311
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,250
I thought it would solve the problem, but no.

312
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,560
No. It just made it worse.

313
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,420
Now she wants to talk about it more,

314
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,510
but there's no more to be said.

315
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,560
That's not the way it works, Shaun.

316
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,760
It can't just be one person who does the talking.

317
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,160
You have to listen, too.

318
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,550
I don't want to listen to her.

319
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,200
It's too...hard.

320
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,800
It's too hard.

321
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,130
Well, relationships aren't always easy.

322
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,920
They get complicated, messy.

323
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,100
Exactly.

324
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,590
That's why I don't want one.

325
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,920
Well, that's not true.

326
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,490
The reason that you left the ER to come talk to me

327
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,390
is because we have a relationship.

328
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,970
And we both benefit from it.

329
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,460
Lea's your friend.

330
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,650
You can't just wall yourself off from people

331
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,640
in the hope that you'll never get hurt.

332
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,760
We need to wall it off so he doesn't get hurt.

333
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,740
Stay calm, buddy.

334
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,340
Just relax your throat and breathe through your nose.

335
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,580
Clamp.

336
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,740
- Got it. - Cool!

337
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,040
Now bite down.

338
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,930
This is a surgical pouch.

339
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,250
It can't even be cut by a scalpel.

340
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,410
Come on, you can do it.

341
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,680
On the count of three.

342
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:50,690
One...

343
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,710
Two...

344
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,480
Three.

345
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,920
- Inez! - What? He was being a total wuss.

346
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,550
Callate la boca!

347
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,140
That was...amazing.

348
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,420
You want to create a plane between the outer serosa

349
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,370
and muscularis layer to avoid disrupting the lumen.

350
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,000
Everything go okay with the husband?

351
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,090
Yes. And, uh, I apologize.

352
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,020
I shouldn't have questioned your decision.

353
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,160
It's all good.

354
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,180
Two Fallopian lesions down, and one more to go.

355
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,620
You want to take the wheel on the next one?

356
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,480
Sure.

357
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,840
Figures.

358
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,040
Nurse Flores, do you have a problem

359
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,800
with Dr. Browne taking the lead?

360
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,420
No. I just find it interesting

361
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,340
that you only gave her the opportunity after she apologized.

362
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,230
You can scrub out.

363
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,370
No. I'll stay.

364
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,740
I'm not asking. I'm ordering. Scrub out.

365
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,890
No. I've done nothing wrong.

366
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,120
You're undermining my management of this procedure.

367
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,310
By answering a question you asked me?

368
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,160
By making snide comments questioning my judgment.

369
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,310
I'm not leaving my post,

370
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,570
so why don't we just get back to work?

371
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,430
You, me, and Andrews will be discussing this later.

372
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,740
I look forward to it.

374
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,510
Gonna need more saline now!

375
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,530
Hi, Daddy.

377
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,620
Have you eaten?

378
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,350
N-not yet.

379
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,020
I'll get lunch after I finish this.

380
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,770
Lunch? It's almost 5:00.

381
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,680
Then dinner.

382
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,030
Look, I'll go now. I'm starving.

383
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,140
I'll be back in 30.

384
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,440
Hey, your erection's back.

385
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,830
She's not talking about me.

386
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,200
30-day suspended sentence and a $700 fine.

387
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,650
Take all these documents to Room 306.

388
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,610
Mr. Alex Leon.

389
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,900
No way, Your Honor.

390
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,130
I've been waiting patiently.

391
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,310
We'll get to you.

392
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,130
When? At 4:59 so you can tell me you've run out of time

393
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,870
and make me come back to do this all over again?

394
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,180
Well, I guess we'll just have to see about that, won't we?

395
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,300
No, we won't. Take a seat, kid.

396
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,790
Your Honor, I am so sorry that my two-minute phone call

397
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,670
was such an incredible inconvenience,

398
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,220
but I went out of my way to be here today to have my case heard.

399
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,250
And that is exactly what I'm gonna do.

400
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,240
Now.

401
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,320
Can I have Dr. Lim's file, please?

402
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,410
Thank you.

403
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,770
And I promise this won't take long because,

404
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,330
as I started to explain...

405
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,260
Guilty.

406
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,800
$1,500 fine and license suspension for one year.

407
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,820
The bailiff will have some paperwork for you to sign

408
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,730
on the way out.

409
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,760
You can't do that.

410
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,250
I have a thick book in my office that says I can.

411
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,330
No. This is America.

412
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,030
I pay taxes, which pay your salary, by the way.

413
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,770
- I wouldn't go there. - Oh, I am definitely going there.

414
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,140
I strongly advise you don't say another word.

415
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,570
You can appeal this verdict to a different judge.

416
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,060
I don't want a different judge.

417
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,680
I want this one to do her damn job!

418
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,580
We keep the TP up front.

419
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,240
Just give a yell if you need some.

421
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,840
{\an3}Is it gonna die?

422
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,480
Just relax. Everything's under control.

423
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,430
That's not a "No."

424
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,480
We're gonna review your lab results and we'll be right back.

425
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,000
Excuse me.

426
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,310
We've already reviewed his labs.

427
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,780
There's no sign of a malignancy, sickle cell,

428
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,760
lymphoma, or leukemia.

429
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,650
I know. I just need a minute to think.

430
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,000
- I think we should... - No.

431
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,400
We're not calling Lim.

432
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,270
We got our asses chewed out last time,

433
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,930
and this is not life and death.

434
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,560
We can inject diluted phenylephrine

435
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,940
every five minutes for an hour.

436
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,530
That's a lot of injections in his penis.

437
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,370
I'll give him a lidocaine local.

438
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,430
Fine. A dorsal nerve block.

439
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,850
You guys are such wimps.

440
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,880
That much phenylephrine could also cause a hypertensive crisis.

441
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,400
Okay, Dr. No, what's your idea, then?

442
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,860
You already rejected it.

443
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,760
We are not calling Lim.

444
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,290
Are you awake?

445
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Yes.

446
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,530
If a patient has reoccurring low-flow priapism

447
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,720
but there's no sign of sickle cell,

448
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,310
blood dyscrasia, or Hodgkins...

449
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,030
Why are you asking me? I'm a neurosurgeon.

450
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,700
My work is up here, not down there.

451
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,270
Because Morgan won't let me ask...

452
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,690
Dr. Glassman, why do you insist

453
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,500
on ignoring Dr. Ko's medical advice?

454
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,560
I'm not.

455
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,610
Really? She advised you to do consults from your ICU bed?

456
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,450
I didn't ask him to come in here.

457
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,650
Go to sleep.

458
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,810
What do you think I've been trying to do for the last 14 hours

459
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,310
and... what time is it?

460
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,970
8:17.

461
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,390
...47 minutes?

462
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,620
I would like some more morphine, please, and an Ambien.

463
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,160
You know you can't have either.

464
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,190
Well, then how the hell am I supposed to fall asleep?

465
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,250
Every time I turn, I strangle myself.

466
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,050
You nurses come in here every 30 minutes

467
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,120
to steal my bodily fluids!

468
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,970
Have you tried easing yourself onto your side

469
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,430
and putting a pillow between your legs?

470
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,040
Of course, that's the problem.

471
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,410
I don't know how to use a pillow.

472
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
Try it.

473
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,330
And I will turn the light all the way off,

474
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,840
and Dr. Murphy will leave you alone.

475
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,670
Winter's procedure.

476
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,280
It's not the solution, but it'll buy you enough time

477
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,100
to maybe find another one.

478
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,770
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

479
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,480
Good night, Dr. Glassman.

480
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,110
Seems like for every lesion we excise, we find two more.

481
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,130
What time is it?

482
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,720
1:12 in the morning.

483
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,860
And my bladder is about to burst.

484
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,570
After I finish this one, I'm gonna take a break.

485
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,770
While I'm out, Park, you take over.

486
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,490
Start on the lesions I showed you on the bladder,

487
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,690
but be careful...

488
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,980
Her pressure's dropping.

489
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,000
She's bleeding out. I can't see anything.

490
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,090
We're taking out the scope.

491
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,400
We're gonna have to open her up.

492
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,170
I've got two units on the rapid infuser.

493
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,200
MAP is still hovering at 60.

494
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,630
Moving as fast as I can.

495
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Paint her with Chlorhexidine and don't make it a Picasso.

496
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,000
- It's a crash lap. - On it.

497
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,750
knife.

498
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,800
Uh, the bleeding's under control.

499
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,900
What about her bladder?

500
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,760
There's infiltrating lesions all over it.

501
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,060
Even the walls are involved.

502
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,610
We're gonna have to remove it.

503
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,210
And give her a urostomy bag?

504
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,500
There has to be another option.

505
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,700
If I had another option,

506
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,620
Nurse Flores, I would've suggested it.

507
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,460
What if we excise part of her bowel,

508
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,940
reconstruct a bladder?

509
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,480
That's a lot more dangerous than...

510
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Making a 28-year-old woman urinate through a hole

511
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,110
in her abdomen for the rest of her life?

512
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,780
I think the additional risk is worth it.

513
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,010
See if the husband agrees.

514
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,770
- Okay. I'll go. - No, Park will.

515
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,660
And while he does, I want everyone but J.L., Dr. Browne,

516
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,830
and Nurse Flores to clear the OR.

517
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,120
You, monitor the patient.

518
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,690
You two, we need to have a talk.

519
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,370
Do I have a choice?

520
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,290
Do you want to keep a fully functioning penis?

521
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,750
- Of course... - Then no.

522
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,790
That's even... Bigger than it was last time.

523
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,600
Winter's procedure requires an extra-large-gauge needle

524
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,970
to poke a hole big enough to restore blood flow.

525
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,920
We'll give you a lidocaine nerve block.

526
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,890
You won't feel a thing.

527
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,990
W-why wasn't I given that last time?

528
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,660
The risk wasn't worth it before.

529
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,270
Uh, trust me, it was worth it before, too.

531
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,310
Good choice. We'll be right back.

532
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,250
W... You said that we needed to do this right now!

533
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,530
We do. I just need to confer with my colleague for a moment.

535
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,410
You're talking to Lim behind my back?

536
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,700
No.

537
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,790
Don't lie. You're not good at it.

538
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,960
I saw you delete her text.

539
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,350
I knew Glassman didn't give you the Winter's idea.

540
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,960
The text wasn't from Dr. Lim. It was from Lea.

541
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,710
If it was from Lea, then why'd you delete it so fast?

542
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,030
Claire thinks I shouldn't push a good friend away,

543
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,400
but thinking about her...

544
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,640
I don't want to talk to her.

545
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,900
You shouldn't listen to them.

546
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,940
Either of them.

547
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,290
Lea and Claire are nice to you.

548
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:20,700
But...they're not your friends.

549
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:24,530
They want to take care of you, like a cute pet.

550
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,580
They take you seriously as a doctor but not as a man.

551
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,880
Lea kissed me.

552
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,010
After we sang karaoke.

553
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,220
Shaun, it was a pity kiss.

554
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,060
You've never even met Lea.

555
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,350
True.

556
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,430
But I know that she's not in middle school,

557
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,160
which means if she really thought of you as a man,

558
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,270
she wouldn't have settled for just one innocent peck.

559
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,620
I just...

560
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,920
What're you looking at?

565
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,190
Hey, Shaun.

566
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,460
What's going on? I thought I couldn't be released

567
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,550
until I was arraigned.

568
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,830
The judge decided nine hours was enough punishment.

569
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,580
She's the one who should be punished. I should sue her.

570
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,910
What you should do is learn to keep your mouth shut.

571
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,340
You're lucky I'm hungry.

572
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,900
{\an8}This stops now.

573
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,510
{\an8}We need to work together.

575
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,760
We are.

576
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,240
That's how we came up with the idea to rebuild her bladder.

577
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,320
There's a way to offer your input

578
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,560
without undermining my authority.

579
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,490
The only thing that undermines your authority

580
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,060
is your comments about Dr. Browne's supposed PMS.

581
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,370
- What? - I never said you had PMS.

582
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,040
I just asked Park if he knew

583
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,210
why you were more irritable than usual.

584
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,540
I'm not irritable, and I'm not a whiner!

585
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,170
I never said you were...

586
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,750
You told me to take it up with Andrews. This was your idea.

587
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,090
If anyone's a whiner, it's you.

588
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,360
That's enough.

589
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,590
You're 12 hours into an operation

590
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,880
you thought was gonna take one,

591
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:30,630
so I think it's safe to say

592
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,470
you're all more irritable than usual.

593
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,960
But you need to get a grip.

594
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,770
Dr. Melendez, maybe it's time you took a little break.

595
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,460
Get an energy bar and some juice.

596
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,810
I don't need a...

597
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,800
Do it anyway.

598
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,140
And when he gets back, I expect everyone in this OR

599
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,970
to conduct themselves with the utmost professionalism.

600
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,530
Can I get two brisket tacos, please?

601
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,060
{\an8}You know what? Actually, make it three.

603
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,270
Thank you.

604
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,860
You're out of order!

605
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,780
She's out of order!

606
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,530
This whole traffic court hearing is out of order!

607
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,740
Okay, very funny, smart-ass.

608
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,700
Actually, I gotta give you props.

609
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,050
You were right about the LIDAR calibration.

610
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,920
If your phone hadn't rung, you might've gotten off.

611
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,440
Next time, I will turn my phone off.

612
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,420
Next time? You're done.

613
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,960
Case closed.

614
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,900
You're gonna start having to work on upping your rideshare rating.

615
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,610
I'm obviously gonna appeal.

616
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,700
She was biased against me from the start.

617
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,470
I see it all the time... Women in power are worse than men.

618
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,680
No comment.

619
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,850
Order up. Brisket tacos.

620
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,610
Thanks.

621
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,280
Oh, thank you.

622
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,610
Want one?

623
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,670
I would love a beer. But I can't.

624
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,800
I'm on call for the next 17 hours.

625
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,910
You're still on call?

626
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,810
What would you have done if they needed you while you were locked up?

627
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,270
I would've had them phone my secondary coverage.

628
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,310
I didn't see the point in waking another doctor.

629
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,380
Or publicizing your predicament.

630
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,560
I'm competing for a promotion,

631
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,110
and I didn't feel the need to tell my boss I was locked up

632
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,840
unless I absolutely had to.

633
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,720
No harm, no foul.

634
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,750
Husband consented.

635
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,150
We're good to go whenever you are.

636
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,280
Scrub back in. I'll be right there.

637
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,960
Oh, I'm gonna kill them.

638
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,080
Oh, God. Oh.

639
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,210
- Sorry. - It's okay.

640
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,060
What?

641
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,030
{\an8}We had a patient come in this morning with low-flow priapism.

643
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,690
We thought it was drug-induced,

644
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,200
but then I noticed a foot drop...

645
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,530
Cut to the chase.

646
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,030
We found an epidural abscess with pelvic extension and...

647
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,950
Get him prepped. I'll be there in 15.

648
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,640
What?

649
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,860
- I gotta go. - No.

650
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,650
Is someone dying?

651
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,360
Not if I can get there in time.

652
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,110
Can you give me a ride?

653
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,540
Irrigate with diluted bacitracin.

654
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,680
Morgan, irrigation.

655
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,500
Sorry. It's been a long day.

656
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,550
And you only have another nine and a half hours to go.

657
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,240
Only 9 hours, 21 minutes.

658
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,220
Browne's right. This flextime schedule is absurd.

659
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,020
Yeah, it has its drawbacks.

660
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,790
But if this penis had been passed on to the next shift,

661
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,160
they would've assumed you missed something,

662
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,830
and they would've done a whole new work-up.

663
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,370
The delay could've paralyzed him.

664
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,830
Or maybe they wouldn't be so tired

665
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,300
and would've noticed the foot drop faster.

666
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,780
You guys are doing fine.

667
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,630
And you'll get used to the fatigue.

668
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,590
After a while, it won't even bother you.

669
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,640
That's easy for you to say.

670
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,960
You were on home-call chilling on your couch all day.

671
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,630
Good point.

672
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,240
Orthotopic neobladder is in place.

673
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,570
Let's make sure it drains properly before we move on.

674
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,510
Flow looks good.

675
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,470
Hold on, push it back again.

676
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,230
What's that? At the base of the uterus?

677
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,750
It looks dusky.

678
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,860
Can I get some more dye?

679
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,040
It's a polyploid mass.

680
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,660
It extends from the uterine to the ovarian artery.

681
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,380
All collateral blood supplies have been invaded.

682
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,840
We're gonna have to do a full hysterectomy.

683
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,150
What if we resect the mass

684
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,260
and graft a saphenous vein for bypass?

685
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,390
Risk of graft occlusion is too high. She'd go septic.

686
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,620
The last thing she told us was her lifelong dream

687
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,680
was to be a mother.

688
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,980
It's an innovative idea. But...

689
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,690
It's not our decision.

690
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,000
I'll scrub out and talk to the husband.

691
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,910
No, I'll do it.

692
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,010
No, I... I... I can't make that decision for my wife.

693
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,660
Yes, you can.

694
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,350
You've already done it once.

695
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,830
This is different.

696
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,310
But this is what Gina wants.

697
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,440
I... I... It's why she made you her proxy.

698
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,270
No. I'm... I'm her proxy because she didn't think

699
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,650
she should ask her mother and sisters

700
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,560
to fly from Maine for a minor surgery.

701
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,390
Look, you have to call them.

702
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,980
No, Gina chose you.

703
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,980
You are the one who knows her, who truly understands her.

704
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,570
What would she want us to do?

705
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,360
I don't... I don't know.

706
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,320
I mean, how... how can any man...

707
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,080
Please, just tell me what to do.

708
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,560
I met her yesterday. I barely know her.

709
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,470
So you can be objective. You... you can make the right call.

710
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,180
No, Gina didn't choose someone to be objective.

711
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,940
- She chose you. - Please, just tell me what to do.

712
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,630
- I can't. - You have to! Because I won't.

713
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,050
I can't do that to her.

714
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:23,050
Please. Just... just help me.

715
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,230
Whatever you say, that's... that's what I'll do.

716
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,350
Whatever you say.

717
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,440
Do you feel sorry for me?

718
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,490
Why would I?

720
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,970
{\an8}Morgan says Lea is only nice to me

721
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,040
because she feels sorry for me.

722
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,600
Does Morgan have a theory for why Morgan is so nice to you?

723
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm being honest, which is better than nice.

724
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,600
Cut this fibrinous tissue.

725
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,630
Bipolar.

726
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,230
Some women put a guy in the friend zone

727
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,800
and they end up treating him more like a pet than a person.

728
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,970
Morgan has a point. Some women do that.

729
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,140
But the only way to find out if Lea does that is to talk to her.

730
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:09,990
The wound is clean.

731
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,040
No more macroscopic signs of infection.

732
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,500
Any spinal nerve damage?

733
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,400
Won't be able to tell until he wakes up.

735
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,790
What'd he decide?

736
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,770
He didn't.

737
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,800
He refused to make a decision.

738
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,220
He, um, insisted that I do it for him.

739
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,160
She really wants to be a mom,

740
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,940
- so I think that we should try to... - No.

741
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,230
He chose me to make the decision.

742
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,290
Her life matters more than a dream.

743
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,580
Do a full hysterectomy.

744
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:26,970
You're right.

745
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,530
Let's go.

746
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,280
She's already been under for 22 hours

747
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,810
and we got a lot more work to do.

748
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,480
Metz and a forcep.

749
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,610
E uterosacral ligament.

750
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,200
Large pan.

751
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,000
- Time? - 4:10.

752
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,140
She's been under 26 hours, 10 minutes.

753
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,000
All right, let's close her up so we can wake her up.

754
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,300
I'll go tell the husband.

755
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,550
No. I'll do it.

756
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,550
Dr. Browne, you take lead on the close.

757
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,310
Wiggle your toes.

758
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,460
All 10 are going to market.

759
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,530
You're gonna be fine.

760
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,840
And, uh, w-what about my...

761
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,410
{\an8}He'll be fine, too.

763
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,510
Thank you.

764
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,430
Oh, don't thank me.

765
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,040
Those two are the ones who saved you.

766
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,660
All on their own...

767
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,710
Almost.

768
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,990
What happened?

769
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,390
The endometrial lesions were much more invasive

770
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,910
than we saw on the imaging.

771
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,680
In order to remove them all, we needed to reconstruct

772
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,300
a new bladder out of a section of your intestine.

773
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,130
And we had to remove your uterus.

774
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,060
Honey, I am so sorry.

775
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,570
It's gonna be okay.

776
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,450
I love you so much.

777
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,780
I love you, too.

778
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,500
Now that we've handled the surgical crisis,

779
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,800
it's time we deal with the unprofessional behavior.

780
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,640
The only question I have is, who exactly is to blame?

781
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,310
It was a 27-hour surgery.

782
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,270
There were some tense moments.

783
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,710
But I was very pleased with how everyone

784
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,570
ultimately worked together as a team.

785
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:33,010
I was especially impressed with how Dr. Browne

786
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,490
aggressively stood her ground and insisted

787
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,930
that I respect the husband's final decisions

788
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,830
regarding his wife's hysterectomy.

789
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,090
Is there anything the two of you would like to share?

790
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,760
No.

791
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:52,880
I'm good.

792
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,350
Well, I'd like to say...

793
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:07,770
I was very impressed with Dr. Melendez's openness

794
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,490
to hearing input from all of the surgical team.

795
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,590
It's definitely something all of us

796
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,030
on the nursing staff appreciate.

797
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,000
Very good.

798
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,330
Go home, get some rest.

800
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,900
You're here.

801
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,570
Yeah, I am.

802
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,130
I shouldn't have told you to go away.

803
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,550
It wasn't very nice and you've always been nice to me.

804
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,550
You've been a good friend.

805
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,770
If you want to talk, I will listen.

806
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,360
You're right. I have been a good friend.

807
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,840
Actually, I've been an awesome friend,

808
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,990
but you have been a total jerk!

809
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,910
You are so worried about me hurting you?

810
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,580
What about how you hurt me?

811
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,680
What? You think you're the only one who has feelings?

812
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,010
You think you're the only one who needs someone

813
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,810
who doesn't judge them, doesn't make them feel totally alone,

814
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,310
like there's not one person in the world

815
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,270
who actually gives a damn about them?

816
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,770
Okay. I'm sorry.

817
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:55,760
No, you're not!

818
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,440
You're... you're just uncomfortable

819
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,860
and you're trying to get me to shut up.

820
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,820
Which, don't worry, I will.

821
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,440
Just as soon as I finish telling you

822
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,530
that friendship is a two-way street, Shaun!

823
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,930
A two-way street, you jackass!

824
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,120
Guess I was wrong.

825
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,980
She does think of you like a real man.

827
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,960
Are you awake?

828
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,380
Hi, Daddy.

829
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,090
Maddie?

830
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,390
How are you feeling?

831
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,110
It's so good to see you.

832
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,480
You're dead.

833
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,740
Don't you think I know that?

834
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,070
Am I dead?

835
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,330
No, dummy. You're just tired.
