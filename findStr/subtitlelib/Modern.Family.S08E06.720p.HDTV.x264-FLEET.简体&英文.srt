我还喜欢这些人的霸气说话方式
I also like the way those guys talk.

48
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,980
原来有专门对挪威人的种族蔑称呢

00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,810
叫冰[哔]

你到底在这个酒吧做什么"工作"
What exactly do you do at this club?

64
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,130
对
Oh, right.

65
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,930
因为我是脱衣舞女  艾丽克斯
'Cause I'm a stripper, Alex.

66

- No. - No.

68
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,290

Okay, well, I'm off.

69
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,480
我要去社区大学
I'm signing up for some business classes

70
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,460
报名参加一些商务课
at community college.

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,140
商务课啊
Business class, huh?

72
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,340
看来有人受到了影响啊
Sounds like somebody's been influenced

73
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,890
因为她和一个行业巨头
by living under the same roof

74
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,410
住在同一个屋檐下
with a certain captain of industry.

75
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,900
谢谢你  亲爱的  但要不是
Thank you, honey, but none of my success

76
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,930
有你照顾家并支持我  我也不可能成功
would have been possible without your support as a homemaker.

77
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,600
亲爱的  你突然对商业感兴趣了
Sweetheart, while I'm very flattered

78
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,470
我真是觉得很荣幸
by your sudden interest in business,

79
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,900
但你还是别再上课了  而是找份工作吧
how about instead of another class, you get a job?

80
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,290
把手弄脏[亲自干活]吧
Get your hands a little dirty, huh?

81
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,610
她可以用手抓抓头发
She could run her hands through her hair.

82
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,690
-那就脏了  -我已经预注册了
- That would do it. - I've already pre-registered.

83
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,310
我还报名了今晚的签售会
Also, I signed us up for that book signing tonight.

86
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,590
我的书就在这
Got my book right here.

87
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,030
-想把这本书弄成你看过的样子吗  -外行
- Trying to make it look like you read it? - Amateur.

88
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,270
我的工作没有职称
So, I don't really have a job title

89
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,160
也没有固定的工作地点
or even a set place to work,

90
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,770
所以我就转来转去
so I kind of just float around

91
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,830
确保所有人得到了需要的东西
and make sure everyone has what they need.

92
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,360
四点了  法官大人
4:00, Your Honor.

你可以在这里积累永恒的人脉
You can make connections here that'll last forever.

96
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,180
也不行
Not really.

97
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,680
这里经常有人去世
We have a lot of turnover here.

98
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,580
从四月以来  外面就一直在降半旗
That flag outside has been at half-mast since April.

99
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,910
所以才有这个
That's why we have these.

100
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,500

天啊  我很乐意  但他们有规定
Gee, I'd like to, but they got rules

126
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,190
亲戚不能为新会员担保  所以

127
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,600
他们没有  我就这样做了

天啊  他们肯定是改规定了

我还有一个能浮起来的酒杯

就算我睡着了  也不会发生糟糕的事

142

别又来了

高中后我就没见过你了
I haven't seen you since high school!

161

-她为什么要贴着名牌啊  -我不知道
- Why was she wearing a name tag? - I don't know.

166
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,450
是你啊
Oh, there he is!

167
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,420
还记得我们玩乐队的时候
Remember that time in band

168
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,950
你把笛子掉进水沟那次吗
when you dropped your flute in the gutter?

169
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,980
抱歉  我从来没吹过长笛之类的
I'm sorry -- I never played the flute or anything --

170
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,240
老水沟吹笛手
Ha! Old gutter flute.

171
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,480
好吧  这到底怎么回事
Okay, what is going on?

172
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,730
为什么所有人都在跟我说话
Why is everyone talking to me?

173
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,980
-我猜他们只是表达善意  -小卡  天啊
- I think they're just being friendly. - Cam, oh, my God.

174
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,680
这是那种互动式剧院吗
Is -- is this one of those interactive theater experiences?

175
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,720
你是说那种观众参与其中的
Oh, do you mean where the audience participates

176
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,490
故意模糊表演者
and the line between performer and spectator

177
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,520
和观众之间的界限的表演吗
is delightfully blurred?

178
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,540
米奇尔  这是一个高中同学会
Mitchell, we're at a high-school reunion!

179
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,440
别装了  好吗  你已经骗到我了
Stop pretending, all right? You tricked me.

180
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,110
-我没有  -你老是骗我
- I did not. - You always trick me.

181
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,940
我们每次出门
Every time we leave the house,

182
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,470
都像是在跟诈欺师斗智斗勇
it's like a game of Three-card Monte.

183
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,460
互动式剧院很有意思
Interactive theater is fun.

184
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,750
没意思  一点意思都没有
It's not fun. It's never fun.

185
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,200
这是人类在和平时期所能遇到的
It's the worst thing that can happen to human

186
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,130
最糟糕的事
during peace time.

187
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:02,960
好吧  米奇尔
Okay, you know what, Mitchell?

188
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,370
拜托  我是管理层的人
Please, I'm on the board,

189
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,550
别人的亲密爱人都开心出席
and I couldn't not bring my husband

190
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,370
我怎么能不把我丈夫
while everyone else's significant other

191
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,770
带来呢
is happy to be here.

192
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,420
所以这是互动剧院吗
It's interactive?

193
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,980
你个贱逼
You son of a bitch.

194
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,550
那句可以上你们的宣传海报
There's a quote for your poster.

195
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,170
-前门开了  -不是吧
- Front door open. - Ay, no!

196
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,960
拜托  是谁  是谁
Please. Who?! Who?!

197
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,260
你到底还在这里干什么
Ay, what the hell are you doing here?

198
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,970
我刚经历了人生中最尴尬的事
I had the most humiliating experience of my entire life.

199
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,690
我可能永远都不要走出这个家了
I may never leave this house again.

200
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,480
好了  你只是累了
Okay, you're just tired.

201
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,350
我给你倒杯咖啡  你就可以再战了
I'm gonna make you an espresso, and you go back.

202
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,760
不  我不能再去了
No, I can't go back there.

203
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,530
你又因为调节灯光惹麻烦了吗
Did you get in trouble again for adjusting the lighting?

204
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,450
你还年轻
You're still young.

205
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,950
光线亮一点没关系
You can take a bright bulb.

206
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,260
我本来在逗艾娃·莫里斯开心
I was flirting with Ava Morris,

207
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,470
结果小腿胫骨狠狠地撞上了
and I walked into a coffee table

208
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,990
一张咖啡桌
and hit my shin really hard

209
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,230
然后在所有人面前哭出来了
and started crying in front of everyone.

210
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,540
已经够惨了吧  然后我发现
Bad enough -- but then I noticed

211
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,290
我不小心洒了点饮料在裤裆处
I spilled my drink on my crotch area,

212
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,450
那画面被人看见我就玩完了
creating a very incriminating stain.

213
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,730
所以我冲去洗手间想拿毛巾擦干
I ran to the bathroom and started drying it with a towel,

214
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,990
结果门开了
but the door swung open,

215
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,560
然后全班同学都看到了
and I was viewed by my classmates

216
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,440
我擦自己"腹部下方"的样子
vigorously attending to my groin.

217
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,740
我刚有提到艾娃祖母穿着比基尼滑水的照片
Oh, and did I mention the picture of Ava's grandmother

218
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,670
当时刚好挂在我眼前的方位吗
water skiing in a bikini that was directly in my eyeline?

219
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,430
这种事谁都碰到过
That happens to everyone sometimes.

220
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,850
只要你喝点咖啡就没...
You're gonna be fine once you drink --

221
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,550
不
Ay, no!

222
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,610
妈妈  妈妈  妈妈
Hi, Mama! Hi, Mama! Hi, Mama!

223
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,690
在工作场所  我们女性被要求
In the workplace, we women have been told

224
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,700
谦让  容忍  无视
to suppress it, contain it, ignore it.

225
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,130
你知道我怎么说吗
Well, you know what I say?

226
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,840
-抓住机会  -抓住机会
- Grab it! - Grab it.

227
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,100
艾丽克斯不是我们家最擅长表达的孩子
Alex is not my most expressive child,

228
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,610
但当她去上了一门商科课程
but when she enrolled in a business class

229
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,370
然后听了一系列名为
and then signed up for a lecture series

230
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,310
"直面女总裁"的讲座之后
called "Meet the She-E-O,"

231
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,030
我就很清楚地了解她的意思了
it was pretty clear to me what she was trying to say --

232
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,850
"我崇拜你  妈妈"
"I admire you, Mom."

233
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,640
-所以你怎么看  -安静
- So, what do you think? - Quiet.

234
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,100
-我觉得...  -别说话
- I think -- - Stop talking.

235
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,610
我知道  这很不容易
I mean, sure, it was tough --

236
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,780
养大三个孩子  还要兼顾事业
raising three kids and running a business.

237
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,500
不过当我有机会成为女总裁时
But when the chance to be She-E-O arose,

238
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,020
我只有一个想法
I had only one thought.

239
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,530
抓住机会  抓住机会  抓住机会
Grab it. Grab it. Grab it. Grab it.

240
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,870
我懂了  我抓住机会了
I get it. I grabbed it.

241
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,360
你再这样我换座位了
I will move my seat.

242
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,710
一个母亲知道怎样读出孩子的潜台词
A mother knows how to read between the lines.

243
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,400
艾丽克斯嘴里说着"你这样让我很尴尬"
Alex's mouth may have said, "You're embarrassing me."

244
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,980
但心里一定在说"你激励了我"
But her heart was saying, "You're inspiring me."

245
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,710
"让我自己待着"
"Leave me alone."

246
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,210
"请给我指引"
"Show me the way."

247
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,780
"你还没说完吗"
"Are you still talking?"

248
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,850
"请永远这么牛逼"
"Never stop rocking."

249
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,990
好吧  第一个问题
Okay, first question.

250
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,830
前面这位
Ah, right up front.

251
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,420
-你好  -你好
- Hi. - Hi.

252
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,720
你好  我是艾丽克斯
Hi, I'm Alex.

253
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,640
长期粉丝  但第一次抓住机会
Long-time reader, first-time grabber.

254
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,910
总之  我在加州理工读生化专业
Anyway, I'm a biochemistry major and CalTech,

255
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,780
但你的书让我对商科产生兴趣
but your book got me thinking about a business career.

256
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,790
所以我现在在考虑双专业
And now I'm considering double-majoring,

257
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,830
但这样是不是负担太重
but is that taking on a little too much?

258
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,280
艾丽克斯  看着我
Alex, look at me.

259
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,170
你能想到  就能抓到
If you can think it, you can grab it.

260
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,220
天哪
Aah! Oh, my God!

261
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,910
你是我的英雄  南希  谢谢
You're my hero, Nancy. Thank you.

262
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,590
下一位
Who's next?

263
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,700
-我有个...  -我就简单说一句
- I've got a -- - just a quick comment.

264
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,620
我也抚养了三个孩子
Um, I also raised three children,

265
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,330
同时是一间大公司的女总裁
and I am the She-E-O of a large company.

266
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,340
我得说
And I got to say,

267
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,980
看到你就像看我自己  南希
it's like looking a mirror, Nancy.

268
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,340
真棒  是哪间公司
That's great. What's the company?

269
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,470
普利切特衣橱及窗帘公司
Pritchett's Closets and Blinds.

270
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,720
你们卖橱柜和窗帘吗
You sell closets and blinds?

271
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,710
一般不是卖百叶窗和窗帘  或者橱柜和...
I could understand shutters and blinds or closets and...

272
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,600
我们公司生意很好  南希
We're good, Nancy.

273
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,300
我想说的是  在你书的第一页
What I wanted to talk about was how on page 1 of your book,

274
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,860
你为什么会说很难不把工作带回家做呢
you say you had hard time not bringing your work home.

275
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,270
那只是个玩笑
That was just a joke.

276
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,300
你应该记得  我的事业起始于我自己的车库
As you remember, my business was started in my garage.

277
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,670
所以你知道重要的不只是跟家人一起的时间
So, you know how it's not just family time that matters.

278
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,820
而是高质量的家人共处时光
It's quality family time.

279
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,600
我同意
I agree.

280
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,240
这就是我对孩子实施在家教育的原因
That's why I home-school all three of my children.

281
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,960
其实我们董事会的会议桌
The conference table in our boardroom

282
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,040
就在他们的游乐设施旁边
actually rests on their play structure.

283
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,260
我在说什么呢  站起来  孩子们
What am I saying? Stand up, kids?

284
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,430
仨个不同爸爸  是吗
So, three daddies?

285
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,360
你听上去像个疯子
You sound insane!

286
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,170
好啦
All right.

287
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,220
普里契特  那不是你的同性恋儿子么
Hey, Pritch, isn't that your gay son?

288
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,670
女婿
Son-in-law.

289
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,300
你的女婿也是同性恋吗
You've got a gay son-in-law, too?

290
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,990
我不要再随你们起舞了
I'm not doing this dance with you guys again.

291
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,880
我不知道自己在担心什么
I don't know what I was worried about.

292
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,950
我只需要让菲尔做自己就行
All I had to do was let Phil be Phil.

293
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,480
他不可能通过投票的
He'd never get past the vote.

294
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,270
幸运的是  即使是最高法院
Fortunately, clueless boobs are one group

295
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,110
也无法强迫我们让蠢蛋入会
the Supreme Court can't force us to let in.

296
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,850
跟我们说说你的事  菲尔
So, tell us about yourself, Phil.

297
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,160
事实上  我们有一些共同点
Well, uh, you and I have something in common, actually.

298
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,860
我们都是议员
We're both Congressmen.

299
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,320
继续说  菲尔
Go on, with that, Phil.

300
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,740
你在州议会
You're in the state congress,

301
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,600
而我曾参加过低年级翻筋斗大赛[议会]
and I was in the Junior Tumbling Congress.

302
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,190
我也参加过翻筋斗大赛
I was in Tumbling Congress.

303
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,510
你玩蹦床吗
You trampoline?

304
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,890
我一周有三晚都在玩蹦床
I'm on my tramp like three nights a week!

305
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,750
剩余的几晚  我都在陪我的娇妻
The rest of the time, I'm -- I'm with my wife.

306
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,320
我带着全现款且无额外条件的报价找到那卖家
So, I go back to the seller with an all-cash no-contingency offer

307
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,750
我的报价不仅够他还清房贷
that'd pay off both his mortgages

308
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,250
而且他的资本收益
and leave enough after capital gains

309
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,040
还足够付一间公寓的首付款
to put a down payment on a condo.

310
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,580
我给他一小时  否则我就撤回报价
I give him an hour or I'm pulling the offer.

311
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,600
我喜欢这故事  就像西部片一样
I love this story. It's like a western.

312
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,610
真是场噩梦
It was a nightmare.

313
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,570
翻筋斗往事  烂笑话  他们居然照单全收了
Tumbling stories, bad jokes, and they ate it up!

314
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,550
要我说他们只是客套一下
I'd say they were being polite,

315
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,270
但我曾亲眼看到其中两个狠人
but I've personally seen two of those guys

316
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,480
开车撞倒了行人时  减速都不减速呢
hit pedestrians and not even slow down!

317
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,810
不  真人真事  真人真事
No, true story! True story.

318
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,750
失陪一下
One second.

319
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,550
这些人赞爆了
These guys are great.

320
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,340
听着
Listen.

321
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,540
你还差一股劲把气氛炒到最热  而我在想
You need one more move to drive this home, and I'm thinking,

322
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,310
菲尔如何把派对炒热到前无古人后无来者
what does Phil bring to the party no else does?

323
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,400
魔术
Magic.

324
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,760
你确定吗  我有点生疏了
Are you sure? I'm a little rusty.

325
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,630
我看好你
My money's on you.

326
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,190
大秀一场  然后滚蛋
Go big, then go home.

327
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,710
-听上去像是你...  -大家注意下
- Sounded like you said -- - Hey, everybody!

328
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,710
菲尔要给你们表演几个魔术
Phil's gonna do a little magic trick for you.

329
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,810
好吧
Okay, uh...

330
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,290
这个魔术献给这里所有的律师
This one is for all of the lawyers in the room

331
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,380
因为你们可擅长将我们的钱...
because you're so good at making our money...

332
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,950
给变没了
disappear.

333
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,440
稍等
Oh, hold on.

334
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,260
莫里议员  别再提纳税了
Congressman Morley, enough with the taxes.

335
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,510
你也没见我们逼你
You don't see us making you pay...

336
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,220
付大钱[从鼻孔]
through the nose.

337
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,680
等等  大家别动  我能搞定
Okay, hold on. Nobody move, I got this!

338
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,740
我骗谁呢  我睡不着觉的
Who am I kidding? I can't fall asleep.

339
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,050
每声汽车警报  以及那窸窣的风声
Every car alarm, every whistle of the wind

340
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,620
听上去都像有人在嘲笑我
sounds like people laughing at me.

341
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,510
这些都是你的臆想
It's all in your imagination.

342
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,950
我只想付费电视上看看《极品老妈》
I just want to Netflix and Mom.

343
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,810
曼尼  你不明白
Manny, you don't understand.

344
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,110
一小时前  我放了一缸的完美的热水
An hour ago, I had made the perfect tub!

345
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,970
再次向你表示感谢  但没啥帮助
Yeah, thanks again for that, but it didn't help.

346
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,060
糖果  我爱糖果
Sugar! I love sugar!

347
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,600
好了  够了
Okay, that is it!

348
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,800
你小子不想去睡觉
You don't want to go to sleep!

349
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,560
而你小子不想去参加派对
And you don't want to go to the party!

350
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,830
-那我这就取消今晚的时光  -妈妈
- Then I'm canceling the nighttime! - Mom?

351
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,720
你听见了  已经到明天了
You heard me. It's tomorrow.

352
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,150
我们这就去学校  到车上等我
We're going to school. Wait for me in the car.

353
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,160
你好  杰
Hey, Jay.

354
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,320
如果你听到留言  求你快...
If you get this, please come --

355
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,630
现在没人能帮你了
No one can help you now!

356
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,910
看上去大家都来了
Yo, looks like everyone made it.

357
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,100
但弗拉德在哪
But where's Vlad?

358
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,230
那个拉脱维亚的交换生吗
The exchange student from Latvia?

359
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,350
我没见到他
I haven't seen him.

360
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,510
我真想再见见那个美男
I'd love to catch up with that dreamboat.

361
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,630
高中毕业后发生太多的事了
So much has happened since high school.

362
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,140
酗酒
Alcoholism.

363
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,790
我试图从酒瓶底寻找幸福
I tried to find happiness in the bottom of a bottle.

364
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,520
对人生苦痛惊天地泣鬼神的描述
A shattering depiction of human suffering.

365
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,250
但还不足以描述我的感受
But enough about how I felt.

366
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,560
我依旧记得我和弗拉德
I just keep remembering how Vlad and I

367
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,420
在高中共度的快乐时光
had the best time in high school.

368
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,180
对我们中某些人来说  却是最后的快乐时光
For some of us, that was the last best time.

369
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,330
越南战争
Vietnam.

370
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,410
这高中时代是发生在哪个年代啊
What time period was all this taking place?

371
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,690
完全说不通
It didn't make any sense.

372
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,880
我和弗拉德分手的那些事
The way things ended with me and Vlad,

373
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,230
至今令我心有余悸
it still haunts me.

374
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,360
很多事也都还令我心有余悸
A lot of things haunt me.

375
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,500
那是毕业舞会的夜晚
It was the night of the prom.

376
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,770
出车祸
Car accident.

377
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,600
路面上结满了冰
The roads were very icy.

378
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,740
-出车祸嘛  -不知道别瞎说
- Car accident. - You don't know.

379
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,700
透过迷雾  我看见了卡车的车头灯
Through the mist, I saw the truck's headlights.

380
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,520
当我醒来  医生告诉我我经历了一场惨烈的
When I came to, the doctor told me we'd been in a horrible

381
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,410
-车祸  -车祸
- car accident! - Car accident.

382
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,680
大姐你有没有搞错
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

383
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,810
米奇尔  这里是剧院  放尊重点
Mitchell, this is the theater. Have some respect.

384
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,030
你只需要乖乖坐着别出声
All you have to do is sit there and be quiet.

385
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,740
泰咪  你绝不会相信谁来了
Tammy, you are never gonna believe who's here.

386
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,410
-是谁  -弗拉德
- Who? - Vlad.

387
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,350
天啊  他在哪里
Oh, my God, where?

388
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,450
就在那
Out there.

389
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,090
就是他  他就是弗拉德
There he is. That's Vlad.

390
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,400
我发誓我不知道他们为啥选你
I swear I didn't know they were gonna pick you.

391
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,640
他们可能觉得你会比较逗
They probably assumed you were fun

392
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,380
因为你是和我一起的  他们太傻太天真
because you were with me. They didn't know.

393
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,540
弗拉德  快上台来
Vlad, come up here.

394
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,160
挪开你的乡下大屁股  我要走人了
Move your country ass. I'm -- I'm leaving.

395
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,080
不  不
No, no.

396
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,720
你就上台去拥抱一下泰咪
Just go up there, hug Tammy,

397
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,260
然后等着惊喜结局就好
and wait for the surprise ending.

398
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,360
我才不在乎什么惊喜结局
I don't care about the surprise ending!

399
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,290
你上去演弗拉德去
You go be Vlad.

400
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,750
我不能演弗拉德  因为我就是那个惊喜结局
I can't be Vlad because I am the surprise ending.

401
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,320
-什么  -那将是令观众掌声不断的表演
- What? - And it's a show-stopper.

402
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,350
我已经排练好几周了
I've been rehearsing for weeks.

403
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,590
你别这么自私了  快上台去吧
Now, just stop being selfish and get up there.

404
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,810
你就上去吧
Just do it!

405
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,400
我们都想快点完事走人
We all want to get out of here!

406
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,360
弗拉德
Vlad.

407
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,420
我也不知道是何时  用什么招
I didn't know how, I didn't know when,

408
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,830
但我知道此仇不报非君子
but I was gonna get him.

409
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,490
弗拉迪宝贝  亲爱的  你来了
Vladdie, sweetie, you're here.

410
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,120
你真的来了
Oh, you're really here.

411
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,660
自重
Not okay.

412
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,240
多圆满的结局啊
Oh, what a happy ending.

413
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,300
我也"圆满"了
I'll say.

414
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,550
行了行了
Okay, okay.

415
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,760
你的口香糖都跑我嘴里来了
That-That is your gum.

416
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,240
多棒的同学会啊
What a great reunion.

417
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,030
是啊  所有人都来了
Yeah, everybody made it.

418
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,960
几乎所有人
Almost everybody.

419
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,920
同学们好
Hello, students!

420
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,660
校工老乔
Janitor Joe!

421
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,360
或者我该说同学们永别了
Or should I say farewell?

422
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,580
突然间我有了复仇的灵感
All of a sudden, I knew how.

423
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,150
同学们  又见面了
Hello again, students.

424
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,420
或者我该说  永别了
Or should I say farewell?

425
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,660
此时不报  更待何时
And I knew when.

426
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,190
等等  大家都看到他的鬼魂了吗
Wait, wait, does-does anybody else see his ghost right now?

427
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:48,890
什么
What?

428
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,000
是啊  有谁能忘记
Yeah, who could forget

429
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,890
他鼓起勇气来参加我们25周年的同学会
how he courageously showed up to our 25th

430
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,720
然后死在我们所有人面前的情景
and then-and then died in front of all of us.

431
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,090
不  我现在刚要死
No, I'm about to die right now.

432
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,040
其实我还记得  他临死时
Mm-hmm, in fact, I-I remember his death

433
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,030
大概是这样的
went a little something like-like this.

434
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,990
我度过了漫长的一生
I've lived a long life.

435
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,720
米奇尔  你在干什么
Mitchell, what are you doing?

436
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,160
结交了那么多朋友
Many friends.

437
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,640
我美丽的妻子贝丝
Oh, my beautiful Bess.

438
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,220
甚至还去了华盛顿特区
Even took a trip to Washington, D.C.,

439
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,990
让我的照片跟议员大人合影
and had my picture made with the Congressman.

440
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,460
但当然我膝下无子
Never had any children, of course.

441
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,460
所以今晚来参加同学会对我如此重要
Which is why it was so important that I made it here tonight.

442
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,970
来见见你们所有人
To see each of you.

443
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,530
你们都是我的孩子
You are my children!

444
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,040
我想最后再留给你们这样一句诗
And I want to leave you with this one last thing.

445
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,180
-不要温和地  -不要温和地走进那个良夜
- Do not go gentle -- - Do not go gentle into that good night.

446
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,100
{\an8}英国诗人狄兰·托马斯的代表作

447
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,100
要怒斥
Rage!

448
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,610
怒斥光明的消逝
Rage against the dying of the light!

449
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,260
我也感觉身体不太舒服
And I don't feel good either.

450
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,250
救场救得"好"
Yeah, good save.

451
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,750
扒到那个"抓住机会"女士的丑事了吗
Find anything on "Grab It" lady?

452
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,130
"南希·德克尔法律纠纷"  无结果

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,620
"...在总裁喜剧之夜大杀四方"
"...at CEO comedy night."

456
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,670
你们好  我们来了
Hello, we're here.

457
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,380
歌洛莉亚
Gloria?

458
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,040
海莉  你还记得那天
Haley, you remember that day

459
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,630
你说无论什么时候我需要保姆
when you said that if I ever needed a nanny,

460
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,650
你都愿意帮我照看乔吗
you would love to take care of Joe?

461
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,040
-人给你  -不不
- Well, here you go. - No, no.

462
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,170
想留几年随便你
You can keep him for as long as you want.

463
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:16,970
谢了
Thank you.

464
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,270
不  那话听起来不像我说的
Uh, no, uh, that doesn't really sound like me,

465
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,010
再说我现在的工作是晚九朝五  再见
plus I have a 9-to-5 job now, so bye.

466
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,150
求你把我也带走吧
Please take me with you.

467
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,140
这是什么情况
What's going on?

468
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,040
妈妈疯了
Mama's crazy.

469
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,440
我才没疯
I am not crazy!

470
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,380
我不过是取消了这个夜晚
I just canceled the night.

471
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,400
曼尼  你给我解释一下吧
Manny, maybe you could help out here.

472
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,260
老妈发飙是因为乔不肯去睡觉
Mom's upset because Joe won't go to sleep

473
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,780
我又不肯回到某个派对上
and I won't go back to a party.

474
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,610
你不肯回到派对上  为什么
You won't go back to a party? Why?

475
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,550
我不幸遭遇了一连串尴尬事件
I suffered an unfortunate series of embarrassing incidents.

476
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,730
我只想喝点小酒泡个澡去睡觉
I just want a wine bath and to go to sleep.

477
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,520
听我说  曼尼
Listen up, Manny.

478
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,840
在经历了那个派对上发生的事以后
Of course you want to run away

479
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,310
也难怪你想逃跑
from whatever happened back that party.

480
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,510
任何人都会想逃
Anybody would.

481
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,920
但那样这些糗事就保证会跟着你到永远了
But that just guarantees that it sticks with you forever.

482
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,660
但如果你昂首阔步回到派对上
But if you march back in there

483
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,290
不以为耻反以为荣
and you own it,

484
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,580
你让那些乌合之众明白你比他们强
you let those people know that you're better than them,

485
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,870
你就会是传奇人物了
and you will be a legend.

486
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,340
-好  -没错
- Okay. - Yeah.

487
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,280
"好"
"Okay"?

488
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,680
你  躺沙发上睡觉去
You, get on the couch, go to sleep.

489
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,070
可我不困啊
But I'm not tired.

490
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,820
我才不管  5  4  3
Don't care. Five, four, three...

491
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,720
好吧  我去睡
Okay, I'm going!

492
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,910
-2  -"好吧  我去睡"
- Two... - "Okay, I'm going"?

493
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,120
我努力了好几个小时  而你上来就
I spend hours trying, and then you just come one --

494
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,090
我做的不过是不做他们的老妈
The only thing I did was not be their mother.

495
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,640
这其中的道理我也不懂  但出于某种原因
Look, I don't get it either, but for some reason...

496
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,620
孩子们都比较愿意听其他大人的话
the kids respond better to other adults.

497
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,370
是啊  但那太不公平了
Yeah, but that's not fair.

498
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,020
为人父母大部分时候都没有公平可言
Well, most of being a parent isn't fair.

499
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,280
现在艾丽克斯迷上了
Right now, Alex is obsessed

500
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,660
一个什么CEO商业女强人作家
with some CEO business woman author

501
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,800
她基本上就是个看起来老一点版本的我
who's basically an older-looking version of me.

502
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,080
顺带一提我和她同龄
We're the same age, by the way.

503
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,900
你知道艾丽克斯很崇拜你  对吧
You know that Alex look up to you, right?

504
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,470
从她对我说的话里还真听不出来
Not by anything she says, no.

505
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,170
他们从不说出口
Yeah, they never say it.

506
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,390
我猜他们认为
I guess they think

507
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,920
说出口会让父母有太多掌控权了
that they're giving the parents too much power.

508
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,840
他们像掉饼干渣一样用些小细节展示出来
They find little ways to express it.

509
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,040
当孩子妈就像当模特一样
Being a mom is like being a model.

510
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,710
得习惯舔着那一点饼干渣过日子
You have to learn how to live on crumbs.

511
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,400
宝贝你回来了
Hi, honey.

512
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,050
好吧
Right.

513
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,890
宝贝  我为我今晚的行为道歉
Honey, I'm so sorry about the way I was tonight.

514
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,970
没关系的
It's okay.

515
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,640
我还因此得到机会去后台见南希呢
I actually got to go backstage and meet Nancy.

516
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,480
她请我们几个去喝咖啡
She invited a few of us out for coffee.

517
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,600
挺好玩的
Oh, fun.

518
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,120
对  不  其实不好玩
Yeah, no, uh, not fun, actually.

519
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,470
她一直在那聊她自己
All she did was talk about herself.

520
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,440
好像她其实只是需要听众
It really just seemed like she wanted an audience.

521
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,580
当账单送过来的时候  你猜她没做什么
And when the check came, you know what she didn't do?

522
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,460
抓住它
Grab it.

523
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,410
对不起
Sorry.

524
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,460
乔在沙发上睡觉
Joe's sleeping in the couch.

525
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,790
他能待在这吗  好的  太感谢了
Can he stay here? Okay, thank you so much.

526
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,370
但今晚也不是完全没有收获
Well, I mean, the night wasn't a total waste.

527
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,750
她走了之后  我坐在那想
After she left, I sat there thinking,

528
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,410
"我为什么要选一门商务课"
"Why am I taking a business course anyway?"

529
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,900
世界那么大  我该去做点什么
I should go out in the world and do something.

530
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,390
所以我看到了咖啡馆里的招聘启示
So I saw a help-wanted sign in the coffee shop

531
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,180
然后得到了一份咖啡师的工作
and got a job as a barista.

532
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,050
真的吗
Really?

533
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,380
真的  明天开始
Yeah, I start tomorrow.

534
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,180
我很兴奋
I'm excited.

535
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,010
我刚还在想  为什么不出去
I just thought, why not get out there

536
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,560
把手弄脏[亲自干活]
and get my hands a little dirty, you know?

537
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,830
晚安
Good night.

538
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,250
晚安
Good night.

539
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,810
桑拿在这
Sauna over here.

540
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,430
浴缸在那里
Hot tub that way.

541
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,380
传说单人淋浴隔间
Legend has it that the holes 

542
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,200
里面的洞
in the individual shower partitions

543
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,240
是用来当雪茄架的
were cigar holders.

544
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,880
至少这是我们对外坚持的说法
At least that's the story we're sticking to.

545
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,880
{\an8}也可以是性交用的寻欢洞

546
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,010
跟我来  伙计们
Follow me, folks.

547
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,670
来过这吗  杰
Ever been in here, Jay?

548
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,310
这里看上去是个
This looks like a good place

549
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,280
吃完甜点后  出场大汗的减肥好地方
to sweat out some Peach Melba.

550
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,140
你干了什么
What did you do?

551
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,200
我卡住了
I'm stuck.

552
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,360
我觉得门缝里卡了一条湿毛巾
I think there's a wet towel wedged underneath the door.

553
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,240
你能把它拉出来吗
Could you pull on it?

554
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,560
以后要整天这样了吗
Is this gonna happen all the time now?

555
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,730
我是不是得无时无刻照看你
Me babysitting you every minute of the day?

556
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,400
它根本不动
It won't budge.

557
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,680
等等  我觉得我找到了紧急按钮
Oh, wait, I think I found the emergency button.

558
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,600
不不  好吧
No, no! Okay!

559
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,680
杰  我已经努力不发慌了
Jay, I'm trying not to panic.

560
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,820
后退  我要拿一块紧急安全石
Stand back -- I'm gonna throw

561
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,360
砸穿这块玻璃了
one of these emergency rocks through the glass!

562
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,360
好烫
That's hot!

563
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,800
我在给前台发短信
I'm texting the front desk.

564
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,300
听着  菲尔  我做不到
Listen, Phil, I can't do this.

565
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,230
你要离开我了吗
You're leaving me here?!

566
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,490
不  我不能忍受你在这个俱乐部
No, I can't have you at this club!

567
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,230
这是我的地盘  见鬼
This is my place, damn it.

568
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,570
不
No!

569
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,120
对不起  菲尔
I'm sorry, Phil.

570
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,590
你不能另找一个俱乐部吗
Can't you find another club?

571
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,810
看看我的生活
I mean, look at my life.

572
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,130
我建好了自己的房子
I mean, I built my house,

573
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,000
还没等我住进去  我就结婚了
and before I even lived in it, I got married.

574
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,160
是挺棒的
And that's fantastic.

575
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,100
然后我有了自己的书房
And then I have my study,

576
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,070
在那我可以关上门喝一杯苏格兰威士忌
where I can close the door and have a glass of Scotch.

577
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,310
而现在那是乔的房间  也挺好的
And now it's Joe's room, and that's fantastic.

578
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,250
但这里是我仅剩的唯一的
But this is the only place I have left

579
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,330
不用和家人分享的空间
that I don't have to share with my family.

580
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,170
我不想当打断你的白痴  但你发出信息了吗
I don't want to be that guy, but did you send that text yet?

581
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,600
唯一我觉得特别的地方
The one place I feel special --

582
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,900
他们喊我王牌或者杰哥或者普里契
they call me "Ace" and "Jay Boy" and "Pritch."

583
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,090
我在别的地方都没在这里痛快  好吗
I'm not comfortable other places, okay?

584
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,910
而你  你在哪都能融入
But you -- you fit in everywhere.

585
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,470
整个世界都是你的俱乐部
The whole world is your club!

586
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,230
但我只有这个地方
But I have this place!

587
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,770
你懂了吧
You get that, right?

588
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,900
维护人员一分钟后就到了
Maintenance arrived one minute later

589
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,740
用海鲜吧里的冰块把他包了起来
and packed him in ice from the seafood bar,

590
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,110
然后他就完好如初了
and he was as good as new.

591
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,810
你觉得怎么样
How you feeling?

592
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,420
好点了
Better.

593
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,300
杰  我在想你刚刚说的话
Jay, I was thinking about what you said before.

594
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,020
如此真诚  敏感
It was so honest and sensitive.

595
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,920
和脆弱
And vulnerable.

596
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
停
Hey.

597
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,820
这件事天知地知你知我知
No one needs to know about that.

598
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,800
不管怎样  这是你的俱乐部
Anyway, this is your club.

599
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,340
我退出吧
I'm -- I'm dropping out.

600
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,120
不  你和我一样理应享受这一切
Well, you deserve it just as much as I do.

601
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,210
没事的
It's fine.

602
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,030
我不能让你放弃这一切
I can't let you give all this up.

603
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,050
拜托  俱乐部里有
For God's sake, there's the club chair

604
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,660
胖子阿巴寇坐着焦急地等待裁决的椅子
Fatty Arbuckle anxiously awaited his verdict.

605
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,660
{\an8}阿巴寇是好莱坞默片时代喜剧明星  被指控强奸致人死亡  
审判三年后无罪释放

606
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,970
杰  我是真心的
Jay, I mean it.

607
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,310
好吧  至少让我送你些什么作为补偿
Well, at least let me give you something in return.

608
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,170
你说吧
You name it.

609
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,050
真的吗
Really?

610
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,070
-对  -那么
- Yeah. - Well...

611
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,540
我不喜欢你现在超级开心的样子
I don't like how happy you look right now.

612
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,270
这才是活着  不是吗
This is living, huh?

613
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,560
我们得在这待多久
How long do we have this thing for?

614
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,920
只有三个小时
Only three hours.

615
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,200
你看到标志了吗
You saw the sign.

616
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,880
每一跳都有价值
Every bounce counts!

617
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,800
太棒了
Yes!

618
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,950
跳起来  跳啊
Get you some! Get it!

619
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,040
我和弗拉德分手的那些事还令我心有余悸
The way things ended with me and Vlad, it always haunted me.

620
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,880
小卡没说错
Cam wasn't wrong about this.

621
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,810
我们买了全票
We paid for the whole seat,

622
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,280
但只看懂了它的边角
but we're only using the edge of it.

623
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,900
你知道吗  我只欠你这么多
You know, I only owe you so much.

624
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,120
我对你的补偿也是有限的
You don't get an unlimited number of these.

625
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,950
泰咪  你绝不会相信谁在这里
Tammy, you are never gonna believe who's here.

626
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,260
-谁  -弗拉德
- Who? - Vlad.

627
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,200
我的天  在哪
Oh, my God, where?

628
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,390
在那里
Out there.

629
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,360
我觉得我得早点溜了
I think might duck out early.

630
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,110
他在那  他就是弗拉德
There he is. That's Vlad.

631
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,360
太幸运了
Lucky!

632
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,730
弗拉德  弗拉德  弗拉德
Vlad! Vlad! Vlad! Vlad! Vlad!
