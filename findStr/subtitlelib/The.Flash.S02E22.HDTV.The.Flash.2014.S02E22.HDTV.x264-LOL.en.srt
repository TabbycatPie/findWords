1
00:00:01,576 --> 00:00:03,230
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,231 --> 00:00:06,700
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,701 --> 00:00:09,747
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.

4
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:12,782
But secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:16,052
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:18,087
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:21,958
but in doing so I opened up
our world to new threats.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,328
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,297
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:29,840
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:31,135
Welcome to Earth2.

12
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:33,236
I met your doppelganger.
She's a cold-hearted

13
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:34,905
ice queen named Killer Frost.

14
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:37,007
- The name is Vibe.
- Reverb.

15
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:39,776
My brothers and sisters,

16
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:42,712
I've brought us to this new world,

17
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:45,048
ours for the taking!

18
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,050
Whose world is this?!

19
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:50,286
Our world! Our world! Our world!

20
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:53,156
Our world, our world!

21
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,306
Reloading!

22
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:17,647
David!

23
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:19,783
Back door! Captain's down.

24
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:22,052
Go, go, go, go, go!

25
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:30,159
Down, down! Down, get down!

26
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:49,634
Some people are calling
it the metapocalypse,

27
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:52,215
the days when Central City
was overrun by an army

28
00:01:52,217 --> 00:01:54,684
with powers beyond imagination.

29
00:01:56,488 --> 00:01:58,187
- METAPOCALYPSE CITY IN CRISIS
- But in these dark times,

30
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,124
we must never forget our own strength,

31
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:04,260
our own power to fight back.

32
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,299
That it is only in the
blackest of nights

33
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:13,670
that we can truly see the light...

34
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:17,040
and know for sure we are not alone.

35
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:21,244
We are never... ever... alone.

36
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:24,606


37
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:25,806
STAR LABORATORIES
LEVEL 600

38
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:30,755
We usually take these guys down
one at a time, not 100 at a time.

39
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:32,822
And yet, you don't seem overwhelmed.

40
00:02:32,824 --> 00:02:34,658
I know we can do it.

41
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,493
Guys. You have to come see this.

42
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:40,229
Cisco, what are you...

43
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:41,564
Caitlin?

44
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:44,267
She's in shock.

45
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:47,203
A little... dehydrated and malnourished,

46
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:49,338
but I think she'll be fine.

47
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:51,474
I'm okay.

48
00:02:51,476 --> 00:02:53,543
What happened? How did you get away?

49
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:57,047
He... let me go.

50
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:59,515
I didn't think he would;
I thought it was a trap.

51
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:02,752
But... he told me you were dead.

52
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,487
I'm not. I'm right here.

53
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:07,824
We're all here, together.

54
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:09,425
Snow.

55
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:10,694
Jay's not here.

56
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:12,762
You're safe.

57
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:15,865
He's gonna overrun the city.
You can't stop him.

58
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:17,433
Yes, we can.

59
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:19,535
Listen to me, he's not going to succeed.

60
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:21,404
We've got this. This is our Earth.

61
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:22,605
You don't know that.

62
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:23,840
You don't know what he is capable of.

63
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:26,275
I know from being in the Speed Force

64
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:29,212
that the universe is with us, not Zoom.

65
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:32,048
And if the universe is with us,
how could we possibly lose?

66
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,549
Right, guys?

67
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:35,118
Yeah, yeah, right.

68
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:38,688
You've been through a lot.

69
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,156
You should get some rest, come on.

70
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:43,392
You were in the Speed Force?

71
00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:45,294
I... when you were gone.

72
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:48,264
It's hard to explain, but we
tried to get my powers back

73
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,633
and when the dark matter lightning...

74
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,501
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

75
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:56,106
We don't think he's
being just a little too...

76
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:57,540
Overconfident?

77
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,609
Yeah, maybe it was his
time in the Speed Force.

78
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:02,378
I mean, he's acting like he's
invincible now or something.

79
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,313
Yeah, like nothing fazes
him anymore, which isn't...

80
00:04:04,315 --> 00:04:06,049
Realistic, no.

81
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:08,818
Somebody needs to talk to him
before letting his guard down

82
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,620
gets him hurt or worse.

83
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:12,688
He did bring me out of my coma.

84
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,125
That's bound to make someone
a little overly chipper.

85
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:18,928
Well, like I said, somebody
needs to talk to him.

86
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:21,264
Amazing job, Anupam.

87
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,633
This is exactly the kind
of groundbreaking thinking

88
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:25,769
I built this company for.

89
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:27,203
Well done.

90
00:04:56,868 --> 00:04:59,435
Everyone, evacuate! Now!

91
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:02,371
Hurry!

92
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,783
Hey.

93
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:15,885
She's out like a light?

94
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:17,253
Yeah.

95
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:19,189
Jay really did a number on her.

96
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:20,756
It's not like he

97
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:25,028
exactly used kid gloves
on the rest of us.

98
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,530
She'll be okay. She just needs time.

99
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,899
And for us to finally bring Zoom down.

100
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:31,734
Which we will.

101
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:35,872
Yeah, because the
universe is with us, right?

102
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:38,374
Listen, man...

103
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,392
Cisco?

104
00:05:56,394 --> 00:05:58,328
Hey. You okay?

105
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,929
- You just vibe?
- Yeah.

106
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:02,165
What'd you see?

107
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:05,034
I saw a bird.

108
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:06,736
Like, a dead bird.

109
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,844
Mercury Labs.

110
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:16,060
It's under attack.

111
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:17,546
All right.

112
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,500
Thank you, Mr. Allen.

113
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:14,737
I'm not stupid.

114
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:22,011
Boom.

115
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:30,430
So how did you know?

116
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:31,932
- Your real identity?
- Yeah.

117
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,232
Come on, Barry, I'm a scientist.

118
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:34,634
We're paid to be perceptive.

119
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:36,836
And you're always a
little too well informed

120
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:39,439
when things go pear-shaped in this city.

121
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,907
But I don't believe
we've ever met before.

122
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,341
Dr. Christina McGee.

123
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:43,543
Doctor Henry Allen.

124
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:44,978
I'm Barry's father.

125
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,245
Okay, now that the
cat's out of the bag,

126
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:47,513
did you happen to see who it was

127
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:49,115
that cause your building to collapse?

128
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:51,084
I didn't see anything.
It happened so fast.

129
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:53,386
Maybe the security
cameras caught something?

130
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:55,288
Can we access them?

131
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,524
Mercury Labs does have a
Crash-Survivable Memory Unit.

132
00:07:58,526 --> 00:07:59,893
A what?

133
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:02,128
Virtually a black box for buildings.

134
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,228
It will have stored all
the security footage

135
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,465
right up until the building collapsed.

136
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,033
Okay, great, I'll go find it.

137
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:09,102
This wasn't some random meta-human.

138
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:11,370
Whenever Mercury Labs has been targeted

139
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:13,506
in the past there's always
been a specific reason.

140
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:15,541
Yeah, someone's after something.

141
00:08:15,543 --> 00:08:16,676
Yes, and that someone

142
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:18,878
is probably Zoom.

143
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,814
There may be one more possibility.

144
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,716
A few months ago, I saw Harrison Wells

145
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:24,417
running out of my facility.

146
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,620
I know it sounds crazy, but
I'm certain it was him.

147
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:29,823
Is there any way he could have
anything to do with this?

148
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,390
A few months ago?

149
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,026
Sure.

150
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,494
Now?

151
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:36,195
No.

152
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:38,698
Yeah, there are a few
more things that we could

153
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,399
catch you up on, Dr. McGee.

154
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,341
Hey, my purse!

155
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:02,889
That ain't yours, punk.

156
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,423
Big mistake.

157
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:07,426
You picked a bad time to play hero.

158
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,609
Dad?

159
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:29,649
Wally.

160
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:31,584
What the hell were you doing?

161
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:33,086
That guy just jacked a bunch of people

162
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:34,353
so I had to go after him.

163
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:36,289
You could have got yourself killed!

164
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,091
I'm not just gonna let these
guys get away with this.

165
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:39,225
I have to do something.

166
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:40,994
Wally, these are not just guys!

167
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:42,195
These are meta-humans!

168
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:44,030
Leaves this to the cops and The Flash.

169
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:45,665
The Flash can't be everywhere at once.

170
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,034
I... I have to do what I can to help.

171
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:50,737
I have to show him I
was worth being saved.

172
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:56,409
Wally...

173
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:00,814
You are... worth it.

174
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:03,817
Really?

175
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:06,285
Am I?

176
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:08,621
'Cause last time I checked,
I'm the guy who avoided

177
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:10,924
his dying mother for weeks.

178
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:13,055
I'm the guy who shamed
a bunch of other guys

179
00:10:13,056 --> 00:10:14,293
and illegally took their cars from them.

180
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:17,030
I'm the guy who caused The Flash
to lose his powers and start

181
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,165
this whole damn "metapocalypse"
in the first place.

182
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,399
Wally...

183
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:22,736
Last time I checked,

184
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:26,206
I've a whole lot to make up for.

185
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,307
That's what I intend to do.

186
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,116
Damn it.

187
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:44,490
Snow.

188
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,360
I didn't know you were here.

189
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:48,694
What you doing?

190
00:10:48,696 --> 00:10:50,429
Jesse asked me to run some tests

191
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:55,434
to see if her genetic
structure had changed.

192
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:58,537
Why did you ask Dr. Snow...

193
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:00,439
to run tests on you again?

194
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:02,242
Because I got hit with
a dark matter, okay?

195
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,577
I mean, that must have
affected me somehow.

196
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:17,590
You're not a meta-human.

197
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:19,358
What you are

198
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,559
is a young woman

199
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:23,629
with a genius-level IQ that we could use

200
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:28,234
in our fight against this
new wave of meta-humans.

201
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:30,603
Okay. All right, fine.

202
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:32,338
Fine.

203
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:42,081
Snow?

204
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,918
You all right?

205
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,953
Yeah, I'm fine.

206
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,496
- Is this it?
- That's the one.

207
00:11:57,498 --> 00:12:00,333
All right, great. Dad, Dr.
McGee, Cisco.

208
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:02,174
Why don't you guys crack this
open, see what you can find?

209
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,835
Sure.

210
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:04,704
We'll go see what kind
of meta-human powers

211
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:06,306
can take down a building like
that and how to stop it.

212
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,041
- Great.
- Sounds like fun.

213
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,476
All right, I'm gonna go
see if Joe needs any help

214
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:12,078
in the streets. Everybody cool here?

215
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,547
Should be a piece of cake, right?

216
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:19,118
- Hey, slugger!
- Hey.

217
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,520
Can I talk to you for a minute?

218
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:22,588
Yeah, sure.

219
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,257
What's up?

220
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:25,892
Well, I know you said that

221
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:28,261
what happened to you in the Speed Force

222
00:12:28,263 --> 00:12:31,130
changed the way you see things,

223
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:33,599
but you seem very optimistic,
you know, with a lot

224
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,969
of meta-humans running
around tearing up the city.

225
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:38,104
What, did you see the future in there?

226
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:40,806
No... not this time.

227
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,242
No... I... look...

228
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:45,245
What I was shown in the Speed Force

229
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:47,546
didn't just change my mind,

230
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,983
it changed me.

231
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:52,785
I don't know... what
you're seeing as optimism

232
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:55,621
is, for the first time,

233
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:58,358
I'm just not afraid anymore.

234
00:13:00,795 --> 00:13:03,796
Great, that's...

235
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:06,399
But...

236
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,502
You know you still have
to be careful, right?

237
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:11,304
What do you mean?

238
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:12,471
Well...

239
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:15,808
I don't... why are you trying to

240
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,477
take something from me that
I fought so hard to get to?

241
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,579
- Barry!
- I... you... you don't know

242
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:22,248
everything that I've been through, Dad.

243
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,284
You haven't been here
long enough to know.

244
00:13:25,787 --> 00:13:27,153
I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

245
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:28,487
I don't know why I said that.

246
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:30,489
I think I do.

247
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:32,591
Hadn't been around.

248
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:35,494
Teach you how to drive or
take you to look at colleges.

249
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,829
But I've done everything in my power

250
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:39,365
to know who you are.

251
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,134
Barry, I don't want to
take anything from you.

252
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:43,469
I believe in you.

253
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:45,604
This isn't about my
not believing in you.

254
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:47,440
I know that.

255
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,943
And I'm fine. Okay?

256
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:51,710
Thank you, thank you very much

257
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:53,146
for worrying about me.

258
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:55,315
I love you.

259
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:57,650
But I'm fine.

260
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:03,556
Come on.

261
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:10,096
What is that?

262
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:12,531
It's CCPD.

263
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:13,666
Zoom.

264
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:14,733
Barry.

265
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:15,768
Don't do it.

266
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:25,445
You know, I never saw the crime photos

267
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,147
of my mother's murder.

268
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:30,116
Well, I guess I didn't need to.

269
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:35,421
I have a ringside seat while
you got whisked away.

270
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:37,228
Too delicate, I suppose.

271
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:43,196
Not just a hologram after
all, are you, Flash?

272
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:48,868
Interesting.

273
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:54,240
I know you didn't call
me up here just to banter.

274
00:14:54,242 --> 00:14:55,908
Let's finish this.

275
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,543
Right now.

276
00:14:57,545 --> 00:14:59,479
Actually, I did.

277
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,881
I called you up here to tell
you you can't keep running

278
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:04,217
from one meta to the next.

279
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:06,052
Around and around,

280
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:08,754
like a dog chasing its tail.

281
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:10,390
I'll do whatever it takes to stop you.

282
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:13,493
If only that were good enough.

283
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,528
'Cause here's the thing.

284
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,596
I know you.

285
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:20,966
I know you, I know
what's holding you back.

286
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:24,737
You and me...

287
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:26,272
we're really just the same person.

288
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:30,009
Yeah, you keep saying that,

289
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:31,577
but it's not gonna make it true.

290
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:34,113
You'll see. We are.

291
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:36,550
DOCTOR ACCUSED OF KILLING WIFE

292
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,184
Same tragic background.

293
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:39,985
Same reason for running.

294
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:43,556
Same desire to be the
fastest, to be the best.

295
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:45,124
The difference?

296
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:47,260
You think your anger is dirty somehow.

297
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:50,096
You want to be seen as pure, the hero.

298
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:52,365
Doesn't it get exhausting?

299
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:53,966
Doesn't it get exhausting, Barry!

300
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:56,669
It was exhausting playing
Jay, believe me.

301
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,870
I'm not pretending.

302
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:03,409
Now if it were me,

303
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,344
I'd let that building tumble
without a second thought.

304
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:06,679
But you,

305
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:08,981
you'll never let that happen, will you?

306
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,917
That's why I'm gonna beat you, Barry.

307
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,654
Because you always have to be the hero.

308
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:17,957
And while you're playing
the good little boy...

309
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:24,630
I'll be busy winning.

310
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:35,060
We can't let Zoom
destroy another building.

311
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,527
We need to take him down.

312
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,464
Now.

313
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,265
How do you propose we do that

314
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,968
with an army of meta-humans
laying waste to Central City?

315
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,870
We couldn't stop Zoom on my Earth.

316
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,933
What makes us different?

317
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:49,774
We're a team.

318
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,009
We start with the meta-humans,
they're his armor.

319
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,011
We take them down first,
then Zoom's more vulnerable.

320
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,279
Barry, we don't even know

321
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,848
how many of his minions there are.

322
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,983
There could be hundreds, a thousand.

323
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,085
And all of them, they're all
working with different powers.

324
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,720
It could take weeks
to track them all down.

325
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,121
Guys, we don't have weeks.

326
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,857
So what we need do to is

327
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,692
come up with a way to
stop them all at once.

328
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,694
Again:

329
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,096
how?

330
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,330
Cisco,

331
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,366
your goggles, your camera,

332
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,201
they didn't work on Earth-2, right?

333
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,936
Yeah, it was a whole
different frequency.

334
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,838
And the way you took
down the Time Wraiths,

335
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,239
that was based on frequency.

336
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,575
Hartley's entire shtick...

337
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,878
I think I'm smelling
what you're stepping in.

338
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,245
- Yeah.
- So basically,

339
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,548
we create some vibrational tech

340
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,149
that can take down the Earth-2 metas.

341
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,551
- Basically.
- Oh, I gotcha.

342
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,452
- Me too.
- I'll help.

343
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,439
Okay.

344
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,055
I'll let you know if I
hear anything from CCPN.

345
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,859
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

346
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,061
You guys...

347
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,497
we got this.

348
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,339
Barr, can I talk to you for a second?

349
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,741
Yeah.

350
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,235
Birds.

351
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,904
Why?

352
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,740
It's like a Hitchcock movie in my head.

353
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,475
What's up?

354
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,611
Man, it's Wally.

355
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,645
Is he okay?

356
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,814
Not really.

357
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,684
Earlier, he thought it
would be a good idea

358
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,418
if he used himself

359
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,556
as bait against a meta-human psycho.

360
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,558
Thought he could do things

361
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,994
the way The Flash would.

362
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,029
Joe, I mean, he... he did tell me that

363
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,365
he wasn't gonna waste the
opportunity The Flash gave him.

364
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,301
I don't know if you can stop him.

365
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,904
I'm gonna have to or he's
gonna get himself killed.

366
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,005
Look, he ain't you, Barry.

367
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,207
He can't just go Mach 50...

368
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,675
Mach 50 isn't a real thing.

369
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,510
The point is

370
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,714
thinking you're invincible
isn't any kind of armor.

371
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:13,084
Wally's already at a higher
risk than I'm comfortable with,

372
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,486
and him throwing caution to
the wind on top of all that?

373
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,454
No.

374
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,858
We got to keep him safe.

375
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,006
So... in the Flash,

376
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:26,660
talk to him.

377
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:27,665
Again.

378
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,136
Yeah, I'll talk to him.
I'll try, I promise.

379
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,549
Yeah.

380
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:35,840
Thank you.

381
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,695
I thought throwing things was

382
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,764
Harry's preferred method
of dealing with stress.

383
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,966
That is how frustrated I am right now.

384
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,535
I'm... just running out
of ideas as to how

385
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,137
to make this work. Where's Barry?

386
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,872
I need a taste of that
"walking on sunshine" thing

387
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,141
he's got going on right now.

388
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,083
No no!

389
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,352
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

390
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,554
It's me, okay?

391
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,556
Breathe. Breathe.

392
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,925
You're okay, all right? You're shaking.

393
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,359
I... I thought I saw him... Zoom...

394
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,494
I thought I saw him right there.

395
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,762
It's just me, okay?

396
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,130
Look at me, he's not here.

397
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,599
He's not here.

398
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,468
I see him everywhere.

399
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,404
Look, you literally

400
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,741
just escaped a psychopath who
kidnapped you, all right,

401
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,209
so I think it's normal for you to have

402
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,610
a severe reaction like this.

403
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,779
This is so much worse than that.

404
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:52,717
I... I'm afraid all the time.

405
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,419
I don't think I can ever move forward.

406
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,687
You will.

407
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:57,855
When?

408
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,557
Jay took everything from me.

409
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,061
My confidence, my trust, my sanity.

410
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,800
I don't think I'll ever be whole again.

411
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:13,137
Of course you will.

412
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,272
I promise.

413
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,520
Stealing is illegal, you know.

414
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:36,794
Detective West tells me that you've been

415
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,629
fighting Zoom's army on your own.

416
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah. I want to help.

417
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,602
I admire what you're trying to do,

418
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,873
but the best way to help is to just

419
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,375
leave this to the police.

420
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,277
Like you did.

421
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:59,549
I do have powers, Wally.
It is a little different.

422
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,019
This isn't your fight.

423
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,420
It's mine.

424
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,823
No, it's all of ours.

425
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,691
This is my city too now.

426
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,359
It's up to all of us to protect it.

427
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,331
Barry, we got a major meta-human alert

428
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,133
at 5th and Main... get there.

429
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,535
5th and Main. Got it.

430
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,837
We'll continue this later.

431
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,384
Why is it always so difficult to choose?

432
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,820
Barry, what it is?

433
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,822
It's...

434
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,356
Laurel Lance.

435
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:49,871
Laurel.

436
00:22:50,974 --> 00:22:52,907
Laurel Lance is dead.

437
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:55,677
On this Earth, anyway.

438
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,448
Poor Black Canary. Bye-bye, birdy.

439
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,183
Earth-2 Laurel.

440
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:04,252
You knew her doppelganger?

441
00:23:04,254 --> 00:23:07,021
We didn't just know her, we loved her.

442
00:23:08,726 --> 00:23:11,159
So... what do I call you?

443
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:12,794
You can call me

444
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:15,296
Black Siren.

445
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:18,433
Zoom mentioned that you
might be showing up.

446
00:23:18,435 --> 00:23:20,702
If he told you what I can do,

447
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:22,604
you should look more afraid.

448
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:25,440
And so should you.

449
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:28,109
Tell me,

450
00:23:28,111 --> 00:23:30,379
why did you take down Mercury Labs?

451
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:33,948
Because I like to watch
things crumble and fall.

452
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,285
Guess what. You're next, red.

453
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:48,812
Barry?

454
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:50,465
You okay, Barry?

455
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:52,539
Look.

456
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,536
Anything over 200 decibels
will kill a human.

457
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,673
Was that too loud?

458
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:02,143
Perhaps we should quiet
things down a bit.

459
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:14,489
You know, the sad thing is,

460
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:16,892
I think Zoom's actually afraid of you.

461
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:19,428
And I didn't think that
he feared anything.

462
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:23,965
And you, you're hardly worth the chills.

463
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:26,902
How many metas did he
send to try and kill you?

464
00:24:26,904 --> 00:24:27,869
Well, it's too bad.

465
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:30,406
He should have just sent me
because that way,

466
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:31,606
you would have already been...

467
00:24:35,078 --> 00:24:36,645
Get in.

468
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:54,228
Thought you might need a lift.

469
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,865
Yeah. Thanks.

470
00:25:01,237 --> 00:25:03,071
You're welcome.

471
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,045
Why do so many villains
that we go against

472
00:25:11,047 --> 00:25:13,014
use sound as a weapon?

473
00:25:13,016 --> 00:25:14,749
- What?
- Nothing.

474
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:17,318
- You're gonna be fine.
- Thanks.

475
00:25:17,902 --> 00:25:20,521
So Wally just drove on
up into the thick of it?

476
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:24,960
Must have been some
conversation you two had,

477
00:25:24,962 --> 00:25:29,098
seeing as though he did literally
the opposite of what we wanted.

478
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:30,765
This I can hear.

479
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,501
It's not funny.

480
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:33,502
I'm sorry.

481
00:25:33,504 --> 00:25:35,303
I'm in no laughing mood.

482
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:37,739
Look, Joe, I tried.

483
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:39,941
I told you I would try, right? I...

484
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:42,210
Wally's a determined kid.

485
00:25:42,212 --> 00:25:44,345
Yeah, determined to
get himself killed.

486
00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:46,481
Or determined to help people.

487
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:47,949
And be glad, or you know,

488
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:49,450
I would not be standing here right now.

489
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:51,019
Well, he was lucky tonight.

490
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:54,122
I don't want to see the
day when he isn't.

491
00:25:54,124 --> 00:25:57,125
We've got more than
luck on our side, Joe.

492
00:26:06,803 --> 00:26:09,504
You know you're not invincible, right?

493
00:26:12,108 --> 00:26:14,475
Yes, of course, I know this.

494
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:16,945
Joe's being...

495
00:26:16,947 --> 00:26:18,446
overprotective, but I get it.

496
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:20,114
Yeah, but it's like

497
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:22,984
you think that nothing can touch you.

498
00:26:22,986 --> 00:26:25,987
Like nothing bad can get in your way.

499
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:28,790
That's not true for any of us.

500
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:30,792
What are you saying?

501
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:32,527
Look,

502
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:35,864
I know that you had an
experience in the Speed Force.

503
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:39,534
And I'm happy that you think
we're gonna win the day.

504
00:26:39,536 --> 00:26:42,904
But I think a little fear
can be a healthy thing.

505
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:46,942
It helps you determine which
risks are worth taking.

506
00:26:46,944 --> 00:26:48,209
I think that's something for both

507
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:49,878
you and Wally to take to heart.

508
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:56,586
T+U+S+U+B+T+I+T+U+L+O

509
00:26:56,587 --> 00:27:00,121
I met your little red friend tonight.

510
00:27:00,123 --> 00:27:02,457
Aren't you going to ask
me if I killed him?

511
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:04,726
You didn't.

512
00:27:04,728 --> 00:27:06,427
You're good but not that good.

513
00:27:08,832 --> 00:27:11,617
And yet I seem to be

514
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:14,536
the only one of your top
lieutenants still standing.

515
00:27:14,537 --> 00:27:17,472
Like I said, you're good.

516
00:27:17,474 --> 00:27:20,374
So why don't you go knock
down a few more buildings?

517
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:22,410
Like I ordered.

518
00:27:22,412 --> 00:27:23,712
What's the point?

519
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:28,483
The point is so that

520
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:30,652
it seems random.

521
00:27:30,654 --> 00:27:34,957
That way The Flash and his merry
band won't realize what I'm up to

522
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:37,592
till it's too late.

523
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:43,898
What are you up to?

524
00:27:44,652 --> 00:27:46,901
No good.

525
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,503
Sorry.

526
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:52,207
There we go.

527
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,474
Are you kidding me with this?

528
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:54,575
Hey, at least it works.

529
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:55,576
Tremendous.

530
00:27:55,578 --> 00:27:56,945
What is it exactly?

531
00:27:56,947 --> 00:27:59,313
It's just a small source of joy,

532
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:01,315
but more importantly, it's how
we're gonna stop Zoom's army.

533
00:28:01,317 --> 00:28:03,184
By giving them all
electroshock therapy?

534
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:05,520
By giving them all
dimensional shock therapy.

535
00:28:05,522 --> 00:28:08,523
This is where I play stupid
and you explain science.

536
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:10,258
Okay. Fair enough.

537
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,927
So all matter vibrates at its
own unique frequency, right?

538
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:14,763
You disrupt that frequency,
you disrupt the matter.

539
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:17,231
Like how an opera singer
shatters glass with her voice.

540
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:18,867
Exactly. So we found out that

541
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:22,586
all Earth-2 people vibrate at their
own, more erratic frequency.

542
00:28:22,587 --> 00:28:23,672
Higher frequency.

543
00:28:23,674 --> 00:28:25,807
- Different frequency.
- Higher.

544
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:28,209
- Higher frequency than we do.
- Right.

545
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:30,444
So I ran this all past Hartley, right?

546
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:32,814
And he postulated that we
could create a sort of

547
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:35,449
dimensional tuning fork ... here ...

548
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:37,052
Okay, you didn't do it yourself.

549
00:28:37,054 --> 00:28:39,054
Just let me have this one, okay?

550
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:40,488
- Have it, have it.
- Thank you.

551
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,090
So if you run around the city

552
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:44,392
fast enough to create
a refracting field,

553
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:46,494
the device can send out

554
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:47,929
a pulse

555
00:28:47,931 --> 00:28:50,331
that'll bounce off of it, split apart,

556
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,600
and collide with itself over and over.

557
00:28:52,602 --> 00:28:55,469
Amplifying it to an erratic
frequency on the Earth-2...

558
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:57,072
- Higher. Higher frequency.
- Higher frequency

559
00:28:57,074 --> 00:28:58,573
on the Earth-2 spectrum.

560
00:28:58,575 --> 00:29:00,541
And when that pulse hits
anyone from Earth-2...

561
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:02,610
It'll disrupt their nervous system.

562
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:04,612
Earth-2 metas go night-night.

563
00:29:04,614 --> 00:29:06,480
- Even Zoom?
- Even Zoom.

564
00:29:06,482 --> 00:29:08,416
Harry and Jesse are from Earth-2.

565
00:29:08,418 --> 00:29:10,085
How do we keep the pulse
from hurting them?

566
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:11,385
Oh, Detective, I
didn't know you cared.

567
00:29:11,387 --> 00:29:12,854
Yes you did.

568
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:14,823
We designed these headphones

569
00:29:14,825 --> 00:29:16,224
to protect us from the pulse.

570
00:29:16,226 --> 00:29:18,064
Beats by Wells.

571
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:19,579
BLACK SIREN LOCATED

572
00:29:20,263 --> 00:29:22,496
Cisco, it's your meta-human alert app.

573
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:24,498
That's the high-rise
development on the west side.

574
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,900
Hundreds of people live there.

575
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:27,802
Ramon, we're up. Let's go.

576
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:30,471
Set that pulse off right now.
Allen, you need to start

577
00:29:30,473 --> 00:29:32,273
generating that refracting
field right now.

578
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:34,308
But Black Siren can take down
this building at any point.

579
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,844
Wha... all those people, Wells.

580
00:29:35,846 --> 00:29:38,780
How many more people are
gonna die while we wait?

581
00:29:38,782 --> 00:29:40,749
Guys, which is it?

582
00:29:42,385 --> 00:29:45,353
I think I just got the
worst idea of all time.

583
00:29:56,967 --> 00:30:00,869
I don't think I've taken down
so many buildings at once.

584
00:30:00,871 --> 00:30:03,404
Maybe you're not as
powerful as you think!

585
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:21,122
What are you two doing here?

586
00:30:21,124 --> 00:30:24,492
Why should you have all the fun?

587
00:30:31,282 --> 00:30:33,916
I thought you two were dead.

588
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:36,218
Zoom thinks that too.

589
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,788
And we'd like to keep it that way.

590
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,957
For now.

591
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:46,395
You think you two can
pull one over on Zoom?

592
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:48,431
Well, enjoy being dead.

593
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:50,098
I told you.

594
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,868
Give her a chance.

595
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,102
What chance?

596
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:56,104
She's not ready.

597
00:30:58,175 --> 00:31:00,175
Excuse me.

598
00:31:00,177 --> 00:31:03,245
Do you know what I'm capable of doing?

599
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:05,080
Try it, and I'll shatter your entire

600
00:31:05,082 --> 00:31:07,316
nervous system without breaking a sweat.

601
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:11,520
Wow, you really think
you can take on Zoom.

602
00:31:11,522 --> 00:31:14,490
We can.

603
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:17,292
You don't even know
how powerful you are.

604
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:20,396
With a single call, you
can take down a building.

605
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,332
I'd call that impressive.

606
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:26,101
But why... stop...

607
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:28,337
there?

608
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:31,206
Why serve a master when
you can be a master,

609
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:33,976
when you can be a god?

610
00:31:36,414 --> 00:31:39,081
We... could be gods.

611
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,290
- All right!
- All right.

612
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:49,458
We're synced up with whatever

613
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,026
the heck that thing is.

614
00:31:51,028 --> 00:31:52,595
Finally something
we're both baffled by.

615
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:54,196
I'm kidding. That, my friend,

616
00:31:54,198 --> 00:31:58,667
is a 75KTSB 40,000-watt
reverberating sound amplifier

617
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:00,569
designed to single out
the operating frequency

618
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:02,638
of every single Earth-2
being on this planet...

619
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,707
which, went contained and magnified

620
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,409
by The Flash creating
a sound pressure wall

621
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:08,977
around the city, will render all of us

622
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:11,781
Earth-2 beings unconscious.

623
00:32:11,783 --> 00:32:13,916
Hence...

624
00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:16,419
the safety precautions.

625
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:18,053
I'm baffled by it.

626
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:20,556
Are we ready?

627
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:23,459
- Yes, we are.
- All right.

628
00:32:25,963 --> 00:32:28,898
Here... we...

629
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,466
go.

630
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,846
If I were interested

631
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:47,550
in forming an alliance with you two,

632
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:49,685
what's your plan?

633
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:52,621
Exactly?

634
00:32:52,623 --> 00:32:55,858
We ambush Zoom at CCPD.

635
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,604
With our three powers combined,
he'll be no match for us.

636
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:03,999
Well, I like the sound of that.

637
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:05,334
Great.

638
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:07,903
Then let's go.

639
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:10,238
There's just one more thing.

640
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:15,711
Reverb... catch.

641
00:33:15,712 --> 00:33:20,383
E*X*C*L*U*S*I*V*E*
^T^U^S^U^B^T^I^T^U^L^O

642
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:24,386
You know, all doppelgangers...

643
00:33:24,388 --> 00:33:26,254
they're mirror images of themselves.

644
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:29,024
But you two, you didn't
know that, did you?

645
00:33:29,026 --> 00:33:31,026
Reverb is left-handed.

646
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:33,696
Well, I just... I just happened to...

647
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:36,164
catch it with my right... run!

648
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:46,842
Oh, no.

649
00:33:46,844 --> 00:33:48,711
What are we gonna do?

650
00:33:48,713 --> 00:33:52,447
I don't think that there's
anything you can do.

651
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:58,487
What the what?

652
00:33:58,489 --> 00:33:59,454
I don't know.

653
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:00,689
Well, do it again!

654
00:34:06,117 --> 00:34:07,396
Cisco...

655
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:13,636
We're a go.

656
00:34:21,546 --> 00:34:23,946
There's nothing on this Earth

657
00:34:23,948 --> 00:34:26,348
that can stop us!

658
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:32,021
It's working.

659
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:41,363
Dad?

660
00:34:41,365 --> 00:34:43,198
Dad, it hurts.

661
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:54,910
- No... no... stop...
- It's okay.

662
00:34:54,912 --> 00:34:56,679
- No...
- It's okay, honey.

663
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,397
Turn it off! Turn it off, it worked!

664
00:35:17,234 --> 00:35:19,301
It's okay, it's okay,
we'll take care of him.

665
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:21,336
It's okay, Jesse.

666
00:35:21,338 --> 00:35:23,138
He's gonna be okay.

667
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:27,717
Barry. We did it.

668
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,102
Bring them all in.

669
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:31,981
Copy that. I'm on clean up.

670
00:35:38,127 --> 00:35:40,160
What's that? I can't...
I can't hear you

671
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:42,296
through the double-paned
soundproof glass.

672
00:35:42,298 --> 00:35:46,166
It's... it's kind of hard to
make out what you're saying.

673
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:49,269
So should we tell Sara and
Captain Lance about her?

674
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:50,938
No, I've seen what interacting with

675
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,374
your family's doppelgangers can do.

676
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:54,809
It's not even Laurel.

677
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:57,313
No. It's just a poor imitation.

678
00:35:57,314 --> 00:35:58,278
Speaking of, that was a pretty good

679
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,481
Killer Frost you did back there.

680
00:36:00,483 --> 00:36:01,749
Guess I was in the right head space

681
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:04,251
to play a cold, vicious killer.

682
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:06,709
How you doing, are you okay?

683
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,210
No.

684
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:10,412
But I think I'm gonna be.

685
00:36:10,414 --> 00:36:11,847
Being out there with you guys,

686
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:13,782
fighting meta-humans,

687
00:36:13,784 --> 00:36:15,918
saving people...

688
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,452
It's the first time I felt

689
00:36:17,454 --> 00:36:19,421
normal in a long time.

690
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:20,689
Come here.

691
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:23,058
- This is a group hug moment.
- Yeah.

692
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,226
It is.

693
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:32,801
So all of Zoom's meta-humans

694
00:36:32,803 --> 00:36:34,169
are locked up in Iron Heights?

695
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:36,438
Most of them. Some are somewhere else.

696
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,439
I don't want to know.

697
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:38,640
No you don't.

698
00:36:38,642 --> 00:36:39,708
And Zoom?

699
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:42,677
The metas we spoke to said Zoom

700
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,179
created a breach and escaped.

701
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:45,714
And how did he do that again?

702
00:36:45,716 --> 00:36:47,966
Who knows, but he's
back on Earth-2 now.

703
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:48,851
Earth-2?

704
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:51,119
That something else I
don't want to know about?

705
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,321
No.

706
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:55,423
All right. Well, Flash, thanks.

707
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:57,492
The man who saved Central
City once again.

708
00:36:57,494 --> 00:36:59,862
No, we're all just
part of the same team.

709
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:03,131
Speaking of teams,
where the hell is Allen?

710
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:06,601
Sorry, man, sorry... hey.

711
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:08,803
Heard my name. What's up?

712
00:37:08,805 --> 00:37:11,106
Good, well, you've got about
100 meta criminal cases

713
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:12,908
to get through, so I would get
to cracking if I were you.

714
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,978
I will get right on that.

715
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,079
Captain.

716
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:21,016
- Well done.
- Thanks.

717
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:24,086
Listen...

718
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:26,188
I've been thinking
about Wally some more.

719
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,290
Are you gonna talk to him again?

720
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,224
No, I'm not.

721
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:30,392
Why not?

722
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:31,960
Because he's your son, Joe.

723
00:37:31,962 --> 00:37:33,628
I know he's my son.

724
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,163
I... look... what I mean is

725
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:37,232
he's got your values.

726
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:40,335
He's got your inner drive to
help people do what's right.

727
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:42,470
We're supposed to think
we're something we're not

728
00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:44,106
until we become that thing.

729
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:46,608
That's the path that Wally's on.

730
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,977
I'm not gonna stop him
from being the hero

731
00:37:48,979 --> 00:37:51,646
that he's gonna become.

732
00:37:51,648 --> 00:37:53,548
I really don't think you should either.

733
00:37:55,786 --> 00:37:57,886
I can't wait till you have
kids and they torture you.

734
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,154
I'ma laugh in your face.

735
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,157
All right, gramps.

736
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,325
Stern.

737
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:04,626
What?

738
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:07,930
My grandkids are
gonna call me "poppa".

739
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:10,198
All right.

740
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:22,344
What in the world?

741
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:23,478
What is this?

742
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,280
- Blame Iris.
- Okay.

743
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:27,816
I just figured that since Henry
is officially back for good,

744
00:38:27,818 --> 00:38:29,418
we should celebrate.

745
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,287
And since Zoom is gone and
the city is quiet right now.

746
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:34,889
Oh, I appreciate it, Iris.

747
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:36,825
Thank you.

748
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:39,261
- Hi, Tina.
- Hello, Henry.

749
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:41,096
- Jesse.
- Hi.

750
00:38:41,097 --> 00:38:43,032
T'U'S'U'B'T'I'T'U'L'O'C'O'M'

751
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:44,066
Good to see you.

752
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:46,001
Good to see you too.

753
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:48,170
- You look... great.
- Thank you.

754
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:51,940
I hope you don't mind
that I invited Dr. McGee.

755
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:54,209
Seems like somebody's glad you did.

756
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:59,414
So I guess you are invincible.

757
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:00,849
Told you.

758
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:02,517
The Speed Force is with us.

759
00:39:05,122 --> 00:39:07,022
Since I'm...

760
00:39:07,024 --> 00:39:10,925
feeling extra invincible lately,

761
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:12,594
what do you say

762
00:39:12,596 --> 00:39:15,897
you and I

763
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:19,167
give this a shot?

764
00:39:19,169 --> 00:39:20,602
Yeah, I would like that.

765
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:27,642
So is it true?

766
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:30,145
You saved The Flash's life?

767
00:39:30,147 --> 00:39:31,579
Oh, I mean, I was

768
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:33,715
just in the right place
at the right time.

769
00:39:33,717 --> 00:39:35,550
Proud of you, Wally.

770
00:39:35,552 --> 00:39:37,852
You did good.

771
00:39:37,854 --> 00:39:39,388
Thanks, Dad.

772
00:39:40,393 --> 00:39:41,689
What?

773
00:39:41,691 --> 00:39:43,791
I'm just... I'm proud of you too.

774
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,727
- Soup's on.
- Hey!

775
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:47,229
Taking out a city full of monsters

776
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:49,264
makes a man hungry.

777
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:51,799
First,

778
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:53,801
a toast.

779
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:55,070
To family.

780
00:39:55,072 --> 00:39:56,905
To family.

781
00:39:56,907 --> 00:39:58,440
That's my kind of
toast, short and sweet.

782
00:39:58,442 --> 00:39:59,995
Let's eat.

783
00:40:06,374 --> 00:40:07,582
You guys.

784
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:08,816
Great.

785
00:40:11,922 --> 00:40:13,855
Earth-2.

786
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,767
Cisco?

787
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:28,537
What... what is it?

788
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:29,804
What'd you see?

789
00:40:29,806 --> 00:40:31,839
What do you mean "see"?

790
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:33,275
Cisco gets visions.

791
00:40:33,277 --> 00:40:34,342
I don't understand.

792
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:36,344
What Cisco?

793
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:39,181
Earth-2 splitting in half.

794
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:41,183
Straight down to the poles.

795
00:40:41,185 --> 00:40:43,017
Tell me I didn't just vibe the future.

796
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:44,486
Please tell me I did not

797
00:40:44,488 --> 00:40:47,055
just see the end of the world!

798
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:57,632
Our story continues,

799
00:40:57,634 --> 00:41:00,068
Flash.

800
00:41:02,806 --> 00:41:05,840
- Henry!
- Oh, my God.

801
00:41:13,717 --> 00:41:15,617
Dad?

802
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:17,051
Dad?

803
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:23,057
It's poetic, returning
to your childhood home.

804
00:41:24,294 --> 00:41:26,094
Jay.

805
00:41:26,096 --> 00:41:28,230
Don't do this.

806
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:29,564
I'm begging you.

807
00:41:29,566 --> 00:41:31,652
I'm begging you! Take me.

808
00:41:31,653 --> 00:41:33,101
- Kill me!
- No!

809
00:41:33,103 --> 00:41:35,103
You still won't believe me
that you and I are the same.

810
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:37,805
- Come on.
- Barry, look at me, son.

811
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:40,708
So I'm gonna have to
make you believe me.

812
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,044
Whatever happens you have made me

813
00:41:43,046 --> 00:41:44,800
the happiest father...

814
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:45,648
Dad...

815
00:41:45,649 --> 00:41:48,074
This time, you're gonna
watch your parent die

816
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:48,750
just like I did.

817
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:50,218
- No, no!
- And this

818
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,153
is what's gonna make you

819
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:52,887
just like me!

820
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:54,088
Your mother and I love...

821
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,117
Jay!

822
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:56,391
No!

823
00:41:56,392 --> 00:42:28,253
