Well, now.

10
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,583
[chuckles]

11
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,541
Welcome.

12
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,916
[thoughtful piano music playing]

13
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,666
-[woman on TV] Got a cigarette, doctor?
-[doctor on TV] Sorry, I…

14
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,625
[TV clicks off]

15
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,916
I asked for a pleasant room,

16
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,208
and I believe they gave me one.

17
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,375

[indistinct conversations]

20
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,500
-I'm Beth.
-Harmon. Kentucky State Champion.

21
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,625
Nice to meet you.

22
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:13,375
There are two games a day,
and the time control is 120/40.

23
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,500
You get two hours to make 40 moves.

24
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,541
Welcome to Cincinnati.

25
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you.

26
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:29,208
And the rook comes to the seventh rank.

27
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:30,958
That right there…

28
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,875
that is a bone in the throat.

29
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,125
Guy takes one look at this,
he pays up, 20 bucks.

30
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,458
The Caro-Kann Defense, genuine bummer.

31
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,541
What's wrong with Caro-Kann?

32
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,291
It's all pawns and no hope.

33
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:51,250
Here, look, I'll show you, all right?
This is Caro-Kann.

34
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,291
-[chess pieces clatter]
-I'd take the knight.

35
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,208
You're, um…

36
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,041
Aren't you that kid from Kentucky
who wiped out Harry Beltik?

37
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,875
If you take his knight,
then you double his pawns.

38
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,708
Big deal. Like I said, it's all pawns…

39
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,666
and no hope.

40
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,125
Let me show you how you win with Black.

41
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,583
Watch this.

42
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,791
What does White do here?

43
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,291
-[Beth, man 1] Queen takes pawn.
-[man 2] Queen takes pawn.

44
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,458
Rook to king eight. Check.

45
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,500
Queen falls.

46
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,916
-That’s Mieses-Reshevsky.
-[man 2] Yeah.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,583
-[man 1] From the '30s.
-Very good. Margate, 1935.

48
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,958
-White played rook to queen one.
-What else has he got?

49
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,416
All right, I gotta go.

50
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,458
Hey, you know what?

51
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,708
Reshevsky, he was playing like that…

52
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,750
back when he was your age, little girl.

53
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:50,833
Or even younger.

54
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:55,666
Are you playing?

55
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,333
Oh, what, here?

56
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,791
Nah, nah.

57
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,208
Just come through, see some old friends.

58
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,333
And plus, playing too many opens…

59
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,083
it can only hurt me, you know what I mean?

60
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,041
Good luck.

61
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,291
-Hello.
-Hello.

62
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,000
Beth Harmon. Where am I playing?

63
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,958
It's table 15, right over there.

64
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,166
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

65
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,250
-Beth Harmon.
-Shit.

66
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,375
-[Beth] Hey!
-[man] Stupid…

67
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,500
-Harmon?
-What are you two doing here?

68
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,500
Losing mostly.

69
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,000
We're on the university team now.
Second and third alternate.

70
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,791
Oh, I'm sorry we won't get to play.

71
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,833
[scoffs] We're not.
You destroy everyone you play, Harmon.

72
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,333
-I can only lose so much.
-[chuckles] That's the truth.

73
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,250
-[Mrs. Wheatley laughing]
-I said slow down!

74

[man speaks indistinctly on TV]

75
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,041
[woman 1] Isn't that skating rink
a little close to the bowling alley?

76
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,625
-[Mrs. Wheatley laughing]
-Do you mind?

77
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,250
-[laughing] Sorry.
-[woman 2] It works out. You see, it…

78
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:25,166
It keeps the bowlers cool,
and you automatically…

00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,375
[TV volume lowers]

80
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,416
What are you doing?

81
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,541
[Beth] Replaying my earlier games.

82
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,666
What on earth for?

83
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,708
Looking for weaknesses in my play.

84
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,166
[TV continues softly]

85
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,083
I see.

86
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,166
And?

87
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,500
[Beth] There aren't any.

88
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,250
Good girl.

91
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,291
It's so much more exciting
than I imagined.

92
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,833
Did you watch the whole game?

93
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,333
Of course.

94
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,250
[man] Beth.

95
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,833
When he brought out his rook,
then took that pawn…

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,333
I thought you were done for.
I should have known better.

97
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,500
Yes, you should have.

98
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,500
[man chuckles]

99
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,416
Elizabeth,

100
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,375
aren't you going to introduce me
to your friends?

101
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,708
[Beth] Sorry.

102
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,583
Matt, Mike, this is my mom.

103
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,083
Mike, nice to meet you.

104
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,791
-Nice to meet you.
-And I'm Matt.

105
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,041
-Mm. A pleasure.
-[Matt] Nice to meet you.

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,041
Well, I don't know about you young people,
but I'm famished.

107
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,416
-There's a restaurant in the hotel lobby.
-Mm. Show us the way?

108
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,333
Sure.

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,625
I can't make up my mind
which one is more handsome.

110
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,000
I'd like to play in the US Open.

111
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,458
You might win it.

112
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,833
Would that lead to playing abroad?

113
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,625
In Europe, I mean?

114
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,666
No reason why not. They have to know you
before they invite you.

115
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,750
Would winning the Open
make them know about me?

116
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,708
[Matt] Hell yes!

117
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:40,375
Benny Watts plays in Europe all the time
now that he has his international title.

118
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,041
How's the prize money?

119
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,625
-[Matt] Pretty good, I think.
-Hm? What's pretty good?

120
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,250
More than in the States.

121
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,208
What about Russia?

122
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,458
The Soviets are murder.

123
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,166
They eat Americans for breakfast there.

124
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,166
I don't think there's been an American
with a prayer against them in 20 years.

125
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:58,666
It's like ballet.

126
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,666
They pay people to play chess.

127
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,750
We should probably go.
We don't wanna be late.

128
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,416
This one's for all the marbles.

129
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,583
Five hundred of them to be exact.

130
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,708
[thrilling music playing quietly]

131
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,958

about being crowded into an ending

134
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,583
with a rook, a knight, and three pawns.

135
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,416
It's so complicated.

136
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,000
[Matt] Uh-oh.

137
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,125
And that's check.

138
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,000
And that's mate.

139
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,458
[onlookers applauding]

140
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,250
I've allowed 12 dollars
for our celebration supper tonight,

141
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,041
and two dollars for a small breakfast
in the morning.

142
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,625
That makes our total expenses,
so far, $172.30.

143
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,333
Which leaves over 300 dollars.

144
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:04,708
Beth…

145
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,583
I was thinking…

146
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:16,166
perhaps you could give me 10%,
as an agent's commission?

147
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
Let's make it 15%.

148
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,458
Which would be 49 dollars and 54 cents.

149
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,583
They told me at Methuen
you were marvelous at math.

150

[Mrs. Wheatley] "Schoolgirl beats

152

"She shows the assurance
of a player twice her age."

153
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,833
That's national recognition, dear.

154
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,500
I'm afraid she's had a bit of a relapse.

155
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,333
The doctor wants to keep her in bed
for a few more days.

156
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,375
I'm sure she'll be better by Monday.

157
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,208
One of the worst colds
I've ever seen in a child.

158

The poor dear.

[whispering] We're gonna be late.

160
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:13,791
Yeah.

161
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,500
Lots of liquids.

162
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,041
-Thank you.
-[flight attendant] You're welcome.

163
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,916
There's a tournament in Houston
over the holidays, starting on the 26th.

164
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,958
I understand it's very easy
to travel on Christmas Day

165
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,958
since most people are home
eating plum pudding or whatever.

166
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,833
[Beth] I saw that one, too.

167
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,083
I believe we could fly to Houston,

168
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,208
have a very pleasant
winter vacation in the sun.

169
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,916
Do girly things.

a very lovely beauty spa at the hotel.

Yes, Mother.

172
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,583
She has a fever of 101.

-Chess isn't always competitive.
-No, but you play to win.

Yes, but chess can also be…

Yes, I know that.

216
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,416
No, yes, of course you do.
I was wondering how you learned to play.

217
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,666
-Mr. Shaibel taught me.
-[camera shutter clicking]

218
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,375
He was the janitor at Methuen.

219

A janitor taught you how to play?

220

-Really?
-When I was eight.

221
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,166
I imagine…

222
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,666
it must have been such a distraction
from life in such a depressing place.

223
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,208
You must have been very lonely.

224
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm fine being alone.

225
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,333
Do you imagine
that you saw the king as a father,

226
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,583
and the queen as a mother?

227
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,375
I mean, one to attack, one to protect?

228

[Beth] Yes.

232
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,666
It's an entire world of just 64 squares.

233
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,416
I feel…

234
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,375
safe in it.

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,625
I can control it, I can dominate it.

236
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,791
And it's predictable.

Tell me, Elizabeth.

242
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,666
Have you ever heard
of something called apophenia?

243
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,375
No, what's that?

244
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:49,625
It's the finding of pattern or meaning
where other people don't.

245
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:56,083
Sometimes, people with this condition
get feelings of revelation or ecstasies.

246
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:01,250
Sometimes, people find patterns or meaning
where there aren't any.

247
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,916
Hm. What does that have to do with me?

248
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,291

519
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,041
Bobby something?

520
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:48,416
-Benny Watts.
-Yes, him.

521
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,041
No losses, but one draw.

522
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:53,541
Queens Gambit Declined
is so well respected.

523
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,583
[Beth] I've seen him a couple of times.

524
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:57,666
Always got a crowd around him.

525
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,250
Well, of course, he's the US Champion.

526
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,291
He's Benny Watts.

527
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,291
[laughs]

528
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:05,708
[Beth] Some people say
he's the most talented American player

529
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:06,625
since Morphy.

530
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,625
I read about a game
he played in Copenhagen,

531
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,208
a draw against Najdorf.

532
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,125
That was in 1948,

533
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,333
which means that Benny
was eight years old.

534
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,916
I've seen a picture of him at 13
in front of a whole bunch of sailors.

535
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:23,416
He played against the entire team
at Annapolis without losing a game.

536
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,333
Sounds like someone else I know.

537
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,916
When I was nine,
I was playing Mr. Shaibel in the basement.

538
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,708
Anyway, I'm not afraid of him.

539
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:35,166
I don't suppose
there's anyone you're afraid of.

540
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,708
There is one player that scares me.

541
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:41,458
Who?

542
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:43,250
The Russian.

543
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:46,250
Borgov.

544
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,916
[Benny] It's a lot more
of a dynamic game than the Caro.

545
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,958
Which is not the case
with QGD versus Slav.

546
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,458
[coins clanking]

547
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:05,500
You're Beth Harmon.

548
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:08,000
[Beth] Yes.

549
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,250
I saw the piece in Life.

550
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:16,333
Game they printed, that was a pretty one.
The one with you and Beltik.

551
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:17,666
[Beth] Thank you.

552
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,125
I'm, uh, Benny Watts.

553
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,041
[Beth] I know.

554
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:25,375
We met a couple of years ago
in Cincinnati.

555
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,041
Didn't meet, but we spoke.

556
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,708
-Cincinnati?
-You didn't play that year.

557
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,583
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

558
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,166
Guess I'll see you tomorrow.

559
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,666
You shouldn't have castled.

560
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,375
In your game with Beltik.

561
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,833
I needed to get the rook out.

562
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:51,041
Well, you could have lost your advantage.

563
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:53,500
I don't think so.

564
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:59,541
He plays pawn-takes-pawn.
You can't take back.

565
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:03,000
-Wait a minute.
-I can't.

566
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,833
I got an adjournment I gotta go play.
But set it up, think it out.

567
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,708
Your problem is your queen knight.

568
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:12,458
I don't want to set it up
and think it out.

569
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,375
[pensive music playing]

570
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,666
[Beth] Beltik could have beat me.

571
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,333
But he didn't.

572
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,333
Yes, but he could have.

573
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:47,291
What's worse is I didn't even see it.

574
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:51,458
Benny Watts, just by reading
about a player he knows nothing about,

575
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,666
he picks it up.

576
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:57,291
I was so proud of myself
when I found an error in a Morphy game,

577
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:59,208
and now someone's done it to me.

578
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:02,458
Stop thinking about
what might have happened in the past,

579
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,791
and get some sleep.

580
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,125
[sighs heavily]

581
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,791

582

[pills clattering]

[crowd applauding]

585
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,166
Pawn to bishop four, right?

586
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,625
-Yes.

-[clock continues clicking]
-[intense music playing]

592
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,791
[Beth] I thought he could see
what I was planning.

593
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:53,958
I thought he could hear my heart beating,
and know how panicked I was.

594
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,083
He still had time to get out of it.

595
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,500
But he took the piece just as I planned.

596
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,791
I went into that game
with a perfect score.

597
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:17,666
Benny had two draws,
so a draw would give me the title.

598
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:20,791
I wanted to win.

599
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,375
I wanted to hammer his weaknesses.

600
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,416
I wanted to show that pirate
that I could beat him,

601
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,541
even though I didn't play
the way he thought I should.

602
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,750
Then, he captured my center pawn,
my protected pawn,

603
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:35,208
the pawn that had held his queen
to her corner for most of the game.

604
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,541
I don't understand.

605
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:40,916
He forced an exchange of queens.

606
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,000
Oh.

607
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,083
Couldn't believe it.

608
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,625
And then I saw what it meant.

609
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:51,291
With the pawn gone,
I was open to a rook-bishop mate,

610
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,500
because of the bishop
on the open diagonal.

611
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,333
I could protect my retreating knight
by moving one of the rooks over,

612
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:59,208
but the protection wouldn't last,

613
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,375
because his fucking,
innocent-looking knight

614
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:02,791
would block my king's escape.

615
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,916
The more I looked,
the worse it all became.

616
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Caught me completely off guard.

617
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:10,375
It was brutal.

618
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:13,916
It's the kind of thing
I did to other people.

619
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:17,041
Kind of thing that Morphy did,
and I missed it.

620
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,708
I'd been thinking about doubled pawns.

621
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,250
You were thinking about winning.

622
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,333
What did you do?

623
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,000
I needed a counterthreat.

624
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,750
A move that would stop him in his tracks,
but there wasn't any.

625
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,250
I spent half an hour studying the board,

626
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,416
and decided that Benny's move
was even sounder than I thought.

627
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,375
I thought maybe
I could trade my way out of it

628
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:43,916
if he attacked too fast, but…

629
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:45,833
he was careful.

630
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,958
I had to retreat, but he kept coming.

631
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,750
I wanted to scream.

632
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,041
You resign, now.

You'll split the prize money.

639
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,666
You'll be co-champions.

640
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:46,208
You will still get a trophy,
albeit a smaller one.

It happens all the time.

642
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:50,208
I made some inquiries.

643
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:53,666
-The Open Championship is often shared.
-I didn't see what he was doing.

644
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,958
You can't finesse everything all the time.

Nobody can.

646
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:02,416
You don't know anything about chess.

647
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,500
-I know what it feels like to lose.
-Yeah, I bet you do.

648
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,333

Why?

654
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,958
I know how badly you wanted to beat Benny.

655
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:39,541
You'll get another shot.

656
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:41,666
Doesn't matter.

00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,000
