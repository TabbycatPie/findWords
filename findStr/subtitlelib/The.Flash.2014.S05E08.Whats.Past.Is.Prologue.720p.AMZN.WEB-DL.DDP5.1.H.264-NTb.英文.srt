17
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,820
Previously on "The Flash"...

19
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,950
That dagger he had negated our powers.

20
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,110
I just lost my speed.

21
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,020
I'm gonna make this right, Gracie.

22
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,620
Every meta will die.

23
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,960
So we're dealing with a meta-human Jack the Ripper.

24
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,250
I give you Orlin Dwyer, also known as...

25
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,360
Cicada.

26
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,130
How many you shoot?

27
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,090
Shot like a hundred.

28
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,090
Any of them good?

29
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,130
Bof.

30
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,980
Guess we'll just have to keep shooting till we get it right.

31
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,010
I guess so.

32
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,180
Orlin Dwyer.

33
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,570
Near as we can tell, he grew up in the Midwest.

34
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,660
In and out of juvie, pretty much fell off the map,

35
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,740
and then popped up in Central City a few years ago.

36
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,370
Part-time employee of Szrek Chemicals

37
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,290
for the last two years.

38
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,870
Foreman says he keeps to himself,

39
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,750
pretty much a loner, gave a fake address.

40
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,490
Did take custody of his niece.

41
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,000
Grace Gibbons.

42
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,260
After her parents were unfortunately murdered

43
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,590
by a meta-human, now--

44
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,550
So now we know why Dwyer hates metas.

45
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,430
Once he got his powers, he started targeting them.

46
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,430
Powers he got the night of the Enlightenment,

47
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,350
as we all know, and he was struck

48
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,270
by a shard from the S.T.A.R. Lab satellite explosion.

49
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,430
Which was also the same night

50
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,730
that Grace went into a coma.

51
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,440
Where Dwyer visits her every day, every night,

52
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,470
for the last three weeks.

53
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,050
So he's there now.

54
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,680
- Yeah. - Oui.

55
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,220
Then let's go get him.

58
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,850
"Let's go get him."

59
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,210
How are you going to do that? Look, as always,

60
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,330
I respect your spirit, Barry Allen,

61
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,690
but as long as Cicada has his dagger to dampen your powers,

62
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,590
there's no stopping him.

63
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,880
So let's destroy his dagger.

64
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
How are we gonna do that

65
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,760
unless we have some kind of

66
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,090
power-dampening dagger power dampener

67
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,220
hidden away in storage?

68
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,640
We don't, but if we did

69
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,140
we'd come up with a much better way of saying that.

70
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,270
Sure, I mean, just, like, dagger-dampener...

71
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,640
Wait, yeah, that's actually-- that's decent,

72
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,850
'cause, you know, you're running into...

73
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,760
Just abbreviate. P-D-P-D.

74
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,220
Guys.

75
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,720
What if we could make one?

76
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,810
Make one what?

77
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,850
What if we can make a weapon more powerful than his weapon?

78
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,870
Cicada can control his dagger,

79
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,130
so what we would need would be something more powerful

80
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,380
than his connection to it.

81
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,740
- Wait, like-- like some kind of super-charged magnet? - Exactly.

82
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,760
I don't know if we have anything strong enough for that.

83
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
We made Sally out of a micro-composite alloy.

84
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,330
As far as satellite's go, she's--

85
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,760
she was heavy-duty.

86
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,390
And even if we could get our hands on the dagger,

87
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,600
we'd still have to figure out how to take the dark matter out

88
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,390
-to negate it's powers. - Well, exactly right.

89
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,150
I mean, what you're suggesting is we find an alloy--

90
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,940
No, no, indestructible alloy that has super magnetic properties,

91
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,300
but also has the ability to negate dark matter.

92
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,180
I mean, where are we going to find such a thing?

93
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,140
The past.

94
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,330
The past?

95
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,770
You've already come across everything that we need, right?

96
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,480
A strong alloy with magnetic properties.

97
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,130
Savitar's suit.

98
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,920
Something to remove dark matter.

99
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,250
The Speed Force transmitter

100
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,050
that Zoom used to steal Barry's speed.

101
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,470
Yeah, but that was his Speed Force.

102
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,720
Yeah, but those are exotic particles,

103
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,840
which are basically the same thing as dark energy,

104
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,250
so we would just need some of that to recalibrate it.

105
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,970
Can-- can you do that?

106
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,310
I mean, you'd have to infuse the transmitter

107
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,140
with the same kind of dark matter.

108
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,920
Like the DeVoe kind?

109
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,590
More like the Particle Accelerator kind.

110
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,690
I'm sorry, we-- we need to blow up S.T.A.R. Labs again?

111
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,690
No, no, not again.

112
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,260
We just need to go back to the first time that it happened,

113
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,410
This is gonna mess with the timeline too much.

114
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,620
No, it's not. Savitar's suit, the transmitter,

115
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,660
these are all just discarded objects in time,

116
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,460
so if we steal them, it won't affect anything at all.

117
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,450
Even if all of that worked,

118
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,350
we can't just waltz into the hospital

119
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,880
with our soon-to-be-named dampening device.

120
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,340
Dwyer smells us coming, he's gone.

121
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,830
Then we do a time hack.

122
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,910
A time hack?

123
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,260
- Is when you-- - Plant something in the past

124
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,040
so it's available in the future.

125
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,980
You go back, you take the device,

126
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,900
and you hide it near the hospital.

127
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,630
Somewhere it won't be found for five years.

128
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,230
He won't even know it's there.

129
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,930
So you and your father go back to the past

130
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,100
to defeat Cicada in the future.

131
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,440
Quite an off-the-cuff plan you've come up with.

132
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,410
We can do this.

133
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,270
No.

134
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,820
I can do it.

135
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,760
Can you guys figure out the best dates to go back to?

136
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,580
We're on it.

137
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,520
- You're not coming with me. - Why?

138
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,210
Every time I try something like this I nearly get killed.

139
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,230
Well, yeah, all the more reason for me to come with you,

140
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,190
so that I can watch your back so you don't get hurt.

141
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,770
It's too risky with the timeline.

142
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,740
All right, look, time travel, it's complicated.

143
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,600
I know, I've already done it.

144
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,890
And look what happened.

145
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,190
Look.

146
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,730
I just want to fix what I screwed up.

147
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,070
Okay, what I did.

148
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,530
Please, let me come with you.

149
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,740
Not today.

150
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,420
You think she should come with me?

151
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,770
Yeah, Barry, I do.

152
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,930
Iris, if I do this,

153
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,690
I'm going back to some crazy times.

154
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,060
Savitar, Zoom, Thawne, Speedsters--

155
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,680
Who you've all outsmarted and defeated.

156
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,220
Look, this was her idea, Barry. Her solution.

157
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,310
And it's a good one.

158
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,160
So, unless you have a better reason

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,690
why she should stay back...

160
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,400
let her do this.

161
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,710
Okay, these are the best of times.

162
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,670
Incidentally, they were also the worst of times,

163
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,160
but in terms of going back, this is it.

164
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,930
Savitar. When we defeated him,

165
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,350
Barry phased into his suit, destroyed it,

166
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,250
sending pieces of it flying far enough away

167
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,850
that our past selves wouldn't notice

168
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,520
if Barry took one or two pieces of it.

169
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,940
- What do you think? - Absolutely,

170
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,730
Barry just has to get back into the Speed Force

171
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,820
before the timeline catches up

172
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,610
and those pieces get erased from existence.

173
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,070
I'm fairly optimistic.

174
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,910
Okay, what about the Speed Force transmitter thingy?

175
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,580
The night that Zoom injected the speed force into himself,

176
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,100
he left the Speed Force transmitter in the viewing room.

177
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,620
Yes, that's brilliant, all he has to do

178
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,520
is make sure no one's in there when he takes it.

179
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,040
What about when the Particle Accelerator exploded?

180
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,960
Well, right before everything went sideways,

181
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,320
Wells was in the cortex, and we...

182
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,870
We were in the pipeline intake.

183
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,120
Ronnie!

184
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,480
That's the best time for Barry to go into the time vault.

185
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,690
He can put a piece of Savitar's suit in the plinth,

186
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,800
and when the Particle Accelerator explodes

187
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,680
it should infuse it with dark matter.

188
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,600
Right.

189
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
So once that's done,

190
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,780
we'll have all the pieces we need to make the device.

191
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,400
We plant it in the hospital, the rest is history.

192
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,110
Great, let's go show Barry and see what he thinks.

193
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,740
I'll be right behind you.

194
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,280
Where did I leave...

195
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,460
What is this?

196
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,810
What is that? Nora's journal?

197
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,040
What, are you stealing now?

198
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,460
No-- yes, but for good reason.

199
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,600
Look at this code.

200
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,130
Have you seen this code before?

201
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,090
- Yeah. - Yeah, when?

202
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,740
Right after Barry came out of the Speed Force a year ago.

203
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,240
And did you decipher the code?

204
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,850
Well, my computer did just one sentence.

205
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,490
Listen here, space invader.

206
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,310
Why don't you try returning the thing to her,

207
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,420
and then asking her?

208
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,790
Of course. Of course.

209
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,780
- Right. - Makes sense.

210
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,280
Just return the--

211
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,450
All right,

212
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,250
let's do it.

213
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,420
Cool.

214
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,040
You're not gonna want to forget this.

215
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,480
Had make some adjustment to the suit,

216
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,800
but I finally figured it out.

217
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,900
For emergencies only.

218
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,740
You don't want to get caught running around the past

219
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,930
- in your future Flash suit. - Right.

220
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,350
You might get ideas.

221
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,440
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

222
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,160
Come on.

223
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,750
Okay, look, follow my lead.

224
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,460
Don't go off book.

225
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,090
If anything goes wrong, do exactly as I say.

226
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,840
Do things usually go wrong?

227
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:18,980
What?

228
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,190
When am I gonna get the chance to do that?

229
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,030
Game face.

230
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,130
All right, so what do we do while they're gone?

231
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,170
Do we stake out the hospital?

232
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,510
Get everything ready here or what?

233
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,140
Nothing. They're gonna return

234
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,970
to the exact same moment that they left.

235
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,510
Wait, so, they're gonna go,

236
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,640
but to us it'll be like they never left?

237
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Yeah, time travel's weird, isn't it?

238
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,590
Here they go.

239
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,800
Good luck.

240
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,480
Get ready.

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,610
Now!

242
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,410
Are you sure we're in the right place?

243
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,840
Is that Savitar?

244
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,050
That's him.

245
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,730
Come on.

246
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
I only have a few minutes left.

247
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,040
If I am going to die,

248
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,770
then everything you love is going to die too.

249
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,210
Holy shrap.

250
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,560
How's it feel to get so close to your ascension,

251
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,350
and end up on the ground?

252
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,390
Now I see.

253
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,400
- It's written. - Nothing's written.

254
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:33,960
What was that?

255
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,590
Time Wraith. They protect the timeline.

256
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,720
I've got to get it out of here.

257
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,970
Nora, you're gonna have to get the shard, okay?

258
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,700
Meet me in the forest where we first arrived.

259
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,560
Mom?

260
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,720
- Did you get it? - Yeah, I got it.

261
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,400
Nice job getting that into the Speed Force on time.

262
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,510
Nothing to it.

263
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,100
Dad, about Savitar--

264
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,700
This is right. 2016.

265
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,690
How do you know?

266
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,000
Because that was Zoom with Wally.

267
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,820
I'm about to lose my speed. Come on.

268
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,950
- Barry, are you okay? - I'm okay.

269
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,040
I'm okay.

270
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,100
Thank you, Flash.

271
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,130
Jay, stop!

272
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,020
If you have any humanity left,

273
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,380
then please let him go.

274
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,390
Caitlin!

275
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,730
We gotta get Caitlin back.

276
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,210
Stay here. Don't move.

277
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,740
Okay? Stay.

278
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:47,790
No.

279
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,670
What?

280
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,000
Barry...

281
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,930
You can't let your losses stop you.

282
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,810
You're the one who taught me that.

283
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,870
You have to keep moving.

284
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,540
You have to... push through.

285
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,400
You have to find a way. You have to fight.

286
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,450
So that nothing, ever, will hold you back, Barry.

287
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,300
Do what you can, and I know you lost your speed,

288
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,000
but everyone's here to help.

289
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,210
My dad, Cisco, Harry...

290
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,670
me.

291
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,680
Come on. Come on.

292
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,410
Well, you change quickly.

293
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,330
What?

294
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,330
- Out of your suit. - Yeah, no, I--

295
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,770
Yeah, it was, just too weird being in it without my speed.

296
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,270
Well, that's your own damn fault, isn't it?

297
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,960
- I guess so. - I know so.

298
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,860
What are you looking for?

299
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,070
I'm looking for anything to help me find my daughter.

300
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,100
All right, just--

301
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,150
I don't have my daughter.

302
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,620
You don't have your speed.

303
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,120
Zoom has Caitlin,

304
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,620
and this whole thing--

305
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,660
this whole thing is going to hell in a handbasket--

306
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,780
No, no, wait, wait, wait!

307
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,360
Her frequency.

308
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,220
- What? - Jesse's frequency.

309
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,390
People from Earth-2 vibrate at a different frequency.

310
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,790
Maybe you could track her that way.

311
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,500
Figure out how to find Snow.

312
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,760
- Did you get it? - I got it.

313
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,010
Let's build this thing.

314
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,640
You're not going anywhere, Flash.

315
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,370
You got what you want, Solomon.

316
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,050
And who is this?

317
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,970
Another Speedster.

318
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,370
No, no, no!

319
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,450
Damn it!

320
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,390
I knew we shouldn't have done this.

321
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,060
Now we have no way to stop Cicada.

322
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,020
I mean, I don't even know when we are.

323
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,600
Dad, Dad, we can fix this.

324
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,940
I can't fix this, Nora.

325
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,270
Cisco can't even fix this. This is Wells' tech.

326
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,270
Well, let's go back to Wells.

327
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,760
We can't. Harry's--

328
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,440
Harry's mind isn't what it used to be.

329
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,360
No, I don't mean that Wells.

330
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,320
I mean the one that built the Particle Accelerator.

331
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
That's not Wells. That is Eobard Thawne,

332
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,560
the Reverse-Flash.

333
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,160
I know, it's just, he's really smart.

334
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,990
So I thought maybe we could convince him to help us.

335
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,400
No, okay, look, no.

336
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,770
The only person Thawne ever helps is himself.

337
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,530
Okay.

338
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm sorry, I just thought that maybe--

339
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,410
What?

340
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,910
I know when we are.

341
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,600
 Leave him. Leave him.

342
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,510
The less we mess--

343
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,210
Mess with the timeline. I know.

344
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,460
I know what this is.

345
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,380
Three years ago I traveled back to this day

346
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,720
to get Thawne's help.

347
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,810
So you have done it before.

348
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,080
Well...

349
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,750
things just got a lot more complicated, didn't they?

350
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,050
Barry Allen.

351
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,760
But which Barry Allen?

352
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,260
Clearly you're...

353
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,010
from a lot later than this one.

354
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,700
Way later.

355
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,100
Way later.

356
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,230
Who's your friend?

357
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,400
Let me guess.

358
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,880
Jesse Chambers. No.

359
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,160
Maybe Lawrence. Wait.

360
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,010
Danica Williams.

361
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,580
It doesn't matter who she is.

362
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,120
She's your daughter.

363
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,750
You've brought me your daughter.

364
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,840
It's, um...

365
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,300
Dawn, if I'm not mistaken.

366
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,760
Nora.

367
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,020
Nora.

368
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,190
that's nice.

369
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,570
At least you still have one.

370
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,340
What, Nora, time travel's so weird.

371
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,400
What do you want?

372
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,160
I need you to fix this for me.

373
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,870
No...

374
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,880
No, if you're here...

375
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,550
And he's here...

376
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,590
that means--

377
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,980
You don't get home.

378
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,840
I get home!

379
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,610
I get home. I go home!

380
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,220
- I get everything-- - You don't go home, Thawne.

381
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,520
Unless you help me.

382
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,620
What do you want?

383
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,920
Like I said, you're gonna fix this for me.

384
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,810
- To do what? - Drain dark matter.

385
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,350
- Whose dark matter? - None of your business.

386
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,560
- It is my business. - No, it's not.

387
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,690
There's no chance that I help you--

388
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,590
- It's none of your business-- - Cicada's!

389
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,970
Cicada's.

390
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,690
The one who got away.

391
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,790
You want to destroy Cicada's dagger, don't you?

392
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,980
We want to save lives.

393
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,200
You want to save lives.

394
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,410
I bet you do. I bet you do.

395
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,110
Especially your own, right, Barry Allen?

396
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,010
Look, that me, he's gonna wake up soon.

397
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,170
He sees me standing here,

398
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,040
your whole timeline is gonna be blown to hell.

399
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,090
You're never gonna get home. You know that's true!

400
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,370
I know! I know!

401
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,560
Where are my manners?

402
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,200
Can I get you a cup of water?

403
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,410
So who made this?

404
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,010
Someone smarter than you.

405
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,970
I doubt that.

406
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,640
You know, Allen, for your plan to work,

407
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,560
you're gonna actually gonna have to have his dagger

408
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,150
- in your possession-- - We've got that covered.

409
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,710
You got that covered. How's that?

410
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,830
With this.

411
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,330
Is that--

412
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,190
It's a piece of Savitar's suit, yeah.

413
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,950
You know what's funny about your dad, Nora,

414
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,910
is he hates me.

415
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,990
Hates me with a passion,

416
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,190
and yet a version of him, this Savitar,

417
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,770
is a much bigger jerk than I ever was.

418
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,740
Did you see the face? Did you--

419
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,970
did you see the, like, pizza face.

420
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,120
- Can you hurry up? - Yeah, I'll hurry up.

421
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,550
I gotta tell you, Allen,

422
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,670
using Savitar's suit,

423
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,710
it's a smart idea.

424
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,180
It was hers.

425
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,190
Clever girl.

426
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,730
Gotta go.

427
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,730
I still look forward to seeing how this all pans out.

428
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,420
Nora.

429
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,330
Hey, Dad--

430
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,590
It's time to go back to the night it all began.

431
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:58,890
Come on.

432
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,300
Tonight, the future begins.

433
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,360
The work my team and I will do here

434
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,630
will change our understanding of physics,

435
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,100
will bring about advancements in power,

436
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,910
advancements in medicine,

437
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,380
and trust me, that future will be here faster than you think.

438
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,880
Uh, why are we going this way?

439
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,790
Why don't we just speed into the time vault?

440
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,810
Because it's a big moment, Nora.

441
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,490
Thawne's been planning this night for 14 years.

442
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,640
If we use our speed, he'll feel it.

443
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Feel a disturbance in the Speed Force.

444
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,100
I wouldn't do that.

446
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,660
Dr. Wells, the accelerator is primed

447
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,390
and ready for particle injection.

448
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,630
I feel I should say something profound like,

449
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,150
"One small step for man."

450
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,360
What's happening?

451
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,780
Wells is about to blow up the city.

452
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,230
All I can think of to say is

453
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,120
I feel like i've waited for this day for centuries.

454
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,310
Without further ado.

455
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,610
Dr. Wells?

456
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,030
Are you okay?

457
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,910
Yeah, I'm great.

458
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,230
I'm...

459
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,270
Caitlin, do you think you could have Ronnie

460
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,300
run the Particle Accelerator parameter numbers

461
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,640
just one more time?

462
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,980
Just for good measure.

463
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,640
- Sure. - Great.

464
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,770
And, Caitlin,

465
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,940
the bottle of Dom we've been saving.

466
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,850
Is today the day?

467
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,640
I think today might be the day.

468
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,560
- I'll go grab it. - Great, be along in a minute.

469
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,430
You got us on pins and needles here, Dr. Wells.

470
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,150
- Exciting isn't it? - Yeah.

471
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,270
Well, it's all thanks to the team, right?

472
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,260
Caitlin, fianc¨¦ Ronnie, Hartley.

473
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,620
Hartley contributed.

474
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,980
Especially you, Cisco.

475
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,330
I have to say I have a vibe about you.

476
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,870
About what you're destined to become.

477
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,130
I want you to know I'm very eager to be along for that adventure.

478
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,600
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

479
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,640
That means a great deal.

480
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,470
- Oh, did you-- - I didn't.

481
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,320
Shall we just go turn on an accelerator and pop some champagne?

482
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,700
- I think-- - Okay.

483
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,300
He's gone.

484
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,390
Good evening, Barry Allen.

485
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,130
I was not expecting you this soon.

486
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,190
She knows you?

487
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,190
I know you as well, Nora West-Allen.

488
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,060
Also known as XS.

489
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,710
Fifth recruit in the rebooted Legion of--

490
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,680
Gideon, the particle accelerator is about to explode.

491
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,870
I need you to recalibrate the system's chain reaction

492
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,390
so some of the dark matter is repositioned into this vial,

493
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,130
and record no reports of this...

494
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,870
Nora!

495
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,940
You really hate him, don't you?

496
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,100
Do you not know what he did?

497
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,140
I know he was your archenemy.

498
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,450
He killed my mother...

499
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,280
and our home

500
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,890
when I was 11 years old.

501
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,370
An 11-year-old boy.

502
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,780
You know why he did it?

503
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,730
He thought if I suffered a tragedy that was horrific enough,

504
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,980
I'd never recover

505
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,690
and never become The Flash.

506
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,230
I-- I didn't know that.

507
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,490
There's probably a lot that's happened to me

508
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,280
that's not in The Flash museum.

509
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,850
It's why you didn't want me to come with you, isn't it?

510
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,190
It's not because it was dangerous,

511
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,880
or because of the timeline,

512
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,450
but because you didn't want me

513
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,990
to know these awful things about you

514
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,070
so it's not what I would remember most when I went back.

515
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,280
You don't have to protect me from this stuff.

516
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,020
- Yes, I do. - No, you don't.

517
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,380
Yes, yes, I do.

518
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,400
You're my daughter.

519
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,240
Yeah, and you're my father,

520
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,560
and I just want to know my father.

521
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,000
Recalibration complete.

522
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,950
Here we go.

523
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,710
Dark matter retrieval successful.

524
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,610
Let's go get our time back in place.

526
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,330
Spinal cord trauma,

527
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,530
he's lost all feeling to his lower quadrants.

528
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,430
That's Harrison Wells.

529
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,130
Dr. Wells, I need you to squeeze my hand.

530
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,070
That's a good sign.

531
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,100
24-year-old male, struck by lightning.

532
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,010
I need a full trauma panel.

533
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,680
Get him to bay one.

534
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,080
What is happening to this city?

535
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,550
Grace's room is on the fourth floor.

536
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,530
This should work.

537
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,690
Let's put it right here.

538
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,330
We did it.

539
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,630
Come on.

540
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,720
Did you even go?

541
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,930
Told you time travel was weird.

542
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,980
- Everything worked? - Yeah.

543
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,930
Is Dwyer still at the hospital?

544
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,000
Hasn't left her side.

545
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,060
Did you plant the transmitter?

546
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,290
Yeah, we sure did.

547
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,020
Let's go get Cicada.

548
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,740
You ready, Barry?

549
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,560
I'm ready.

550
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,070
Cicada.

551
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,780
Is that what you call me?

552
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,390
Not all meta-humans

553
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,740
are responsible for what happened to Grace.

554
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,130
Yes, they are.

555
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,920
The destruction they cause, the death,

556
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,640
the pain.

557
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,240
I know about pain and death.

558
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,570
Taking it out on the world,

559
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,010
that's not gonna help. Think about Grace.

560
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,590
She's all I think about, Flash.

561
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,320
And I'm making the world safe for her.

562
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,860
Every meta-human must go.

563
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,190
Then what about you?

564
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,330
You're a meta-human now.

565
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,840
I am,

566
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,740
and after you're gone, I'll join you.

567
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,640
All four of you.

568
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,670
Come on, work.

569
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,150
- It worked. - It worked.

570
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,250
Let's see how you like it.

571
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,170
Cisco, now.

572
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,500
Breach it out of here!

573
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,660
Gotcha.

574
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,380
Oh, man.

575
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,260
You look like you're having a day.

576
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,650
Is it 'cause I just threw your dagger into outer space,

577
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,290
or 'cause you're just now realizing you didn't kill me.

578
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,600
We stopped you.

579
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,700
You stop nothing.

580
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,720
The satellite's tracking the dagger

581
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,450
back through the exosphere.

582
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,750
Guys, Cicada's recalling the dagger back from space.

583
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,410
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

584
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,130
This ends now.

585
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,080
Barry!

586
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,520
No!

587
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,550
Let's dance, cricket freak.

588
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,480
Dwyer's not popping up in facial recognition.

589
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:45,180
And there's no dark matter traces from his dagger.

590
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,580
Well, he won't stay away from his niece for long,

591
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,370
and when he returns, we'll be ready.

592
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:53,820
Yeah, we will, thanks to Killer Frost.

593
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,380
I don't understand.

594
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,050
How can she still come out?

595
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,540
She didn't come from dark matter,

596
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,050
so I guess she's immune to Cicada's dagger.

597
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,600
She just might be the key to stopping Cicada for good.

598
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,300
Maybe we should go check in with her.

599
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,540
- What do you think? - Yeah.

600
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,250
- Cricket freak, huh? - Yeah.

601
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,390
Just came out.

602
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,700
Proud of you.

603
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,750
- Hey, "Sher-loke." - Sherloque.

604
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,550
- Tea? - No, thank you.

605
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,930
Have you see my--

606
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,090
- journal. - Yeah.

607
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,750
Forgive me, but couldn't help but notice

608
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,820
this composition.

609
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:51,860
That's really nothing special.

610
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,940
But it...

611
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,660
feels like something special.

612
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,940
I don't like to brag, but speak a lot of languages

613
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,830
and yet this one...

614
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,070
this one I don't recognize.

615
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,880
It's a time language.

616
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,530
Time language, really?

617
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,850
It's used to record events

618
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,530
regardless of changes in the timeline

619
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,320
so no matter what happens I'll always remember my dad.

620
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,800
Hmm, where does one learn something like that?

621
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,710
Time travel school?

622
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,040
I created it, actually.

623
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,340
You created it?

624
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,090
Clever girl.

625
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,170
I forget myself.

626
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,440
This is yours.

629
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,430
They were the best.

630
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,390
Dad.

631
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,280
- Dad, I didn't-- - It's all right.

632
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,600
I understand.

633
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,200
- I love you. - I love you, too.

634
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,850
Do you ever think about stopping

635
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,400
what's about to happen?

636
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,080
Every day.

637
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,820
Thanks for bringing me with you today.

638
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,170
It meant a lot.

639
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,460
I'm glad you came.

640
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,200
Hey, Old Man, come on.

641
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:54,910
Come on.

642
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,070
Old Man?

643
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,570
Good evening, Nora West-Allen.

644
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,270
Gideon, another data entry.

645
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,570
Entry uploaded and recorded.

646
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,470
Shall I send it to the same recipient?

647
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,440
Yes.

648
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,800
Entry sent.

649
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,020
Would you like assistance with anything else?

650
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,040
Yes, send a personal message from me.

651
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,640
What would you like it to say?

652
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,030
Actually, I'll deliver it myself.

653
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,720
We need to talk.

654
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,640
Yes, Nora.

655
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,040
Yes, we do.

657
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,430
You failed.

658
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,280
Why are you doing this?

659
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,150
You did this to yourself,

660
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,060
and now, all of you will perish.
