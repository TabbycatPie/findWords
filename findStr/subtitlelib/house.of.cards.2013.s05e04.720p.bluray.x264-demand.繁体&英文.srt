我第一次上了一位總統
First time I've fucked a president.

148
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,620
-不要這樣講  -馬歇爾說...

I'm not a president yet.

150
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,090
就快了
Almost.

151
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,950
我得穿好衣服
I got to put on a suit.

152
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,840
-大家就要來了  -威爾
- People will be here soon. - Will...

153
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,310
你就不能允許自己感受一下嗎
can't you let yourself feel it?

154
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,040
就快了
Almost.

155
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,070
-您準備好就開始  先生  -請接通州長
- Ready when you are, sir. - Put the governor on, please.

156
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,940
-你好  -米切  我是總統
- Hello. - Mitch, this is the president.

157
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,570
我知道你聽過簡報了
I understand you've been briefed.

158
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,860
總統先生
Oh, Mr. President...

159
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
這讓我們猝不及防
this is catching us all off guard over here.

160
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,200
州的  當地的  我們都不知道
State, local, we had no idea.

161
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,220
我理解
I understand.

162
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,460
我跟副總統  和國務卿杜蘭特在一起
I'm with the vice president, the Secretary of State Durant,

163
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,600
反恐處助理局長格林也在線上
and on the line with us is Counterterrorism Director Green.

164
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,450
州長  很抱歉  但我們必須行動
Governor, sir, I'm sorry, but we needed to act.

165
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,270
我直接聯系了當地執法部門
I contacted local law enforcement directly.

166
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,980
我是過了好一會兒才知道
Well, it took a while to get to me.

167
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,130
米切  反恐處助理局長要與我們分享一些
Mitch, the Counterterrorism Director will be sharing information

168
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,730
絕不能外泄的信息
that we must keep amongst ourselves.

169
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,830
我們不想做任何會影響今天投票的事
We do not want to do anything that affects today's voting.

170
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,020
45分鐘之前
Forty-five minutes ago,

171
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,740
我們突襲了穆罕默德·卡拉比的住處  先生
we raided the home of Muhammed Kalabi, sir.

172
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,160
在戴德里克大街
On Deaderick Ave.

173
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,720
-嗯  -那里離體育場很近
- Yes. - It's near the Coliseum.

174
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,640
嫌疑人不在公寓里
The suspect was not in his apartment,

175
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,150
但是我們發現了制造炸彈的材料
but we did find bomb-making material.

176
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,120
-天哪  -米切
- Jesus, uh... - Now, Mitch...

177
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,720
我們最不希望的就是讓你恐慌
the last thing we want is for you to panic.

178
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,740
你一定要知道聯邦政府
You must know that you have the full support

179
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,300
會全力支持你
of the federal government here.

180
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,240
接下來怎么辦
Um, it... Well, what... what's next?

181
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,590
我們相信他的目標是某個投票中心
We believe his target is one of the voting centers.

182
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,030
我們知道你已經安排了警衛隊
We know you have soldiers in place,

183
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,680
采取了安全措施  設置了檢查站
security measures and checkpoints.

184
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,370
格林局長正趕去見你
Director Green is on his way to you.

185
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,360
聯調局諾克斯維爾辦事處會設立指揮中心
There will be a command center out of the FBI office in Knoxville

186
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
我們將進行協調
where we will coordinate.

187
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,990
我的家人今早就在體育場投了票
My family voted at the Coliseum this morning.

188
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,250
米切  聽我說
Mitch, listen to me.

189
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,510
不管你需要什么  我們都會提供
Whatever you need, we will provide.

190
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,140
俄亥俄的數字怎么樣
How are the Ohio numbers?

191
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,270
投票率這么低  不好估計
It's hard to gauge with turnout this low.

192
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,620
就是要這效果
That was kind of the point.

193
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,010
是對于另一方  不是民主黨
For the other side, not Democrats.

194
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,450
州長擔心了  你有什么數據嗎
The governor's worried. Do you have any numbers?

195
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,100
沒有  只有我們給過你的
No, just what we gave you.

196
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,440
我以為總統可能有
I would think that the president might have

197
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,950
我們接觸不到的數據
access to some numbers that we don't.

198
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,730
如果我有  你也會有
When I get them, you'll get them.

199
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,850
-我們很擔心  -堅持住
- We're worried. - Hang in there.

200
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,520
等過了3點這一波我再跟你聯系
I'll touch base with you after the three o'clock wave.

201
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,350
請讓我單獨待會兒  謝謝
If you could all just give me a moment, please. Thank you.

202
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,420
你最好去宴會廳
You better head over to the ballroom.

203
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,220
我們其中一人應該到場
One of us should make an appearance.

204
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,380
先生  這一天終于到了
Sir, the day has finally arrived.

205
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,700
是啊  讓我們看看這一天有多長吧
Yes, and let's see just how long this day lasts.

206
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,740
想像一下國安局給我打電話問
Imagine my surprise when the NSA called me

207
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,010
穆罕默德·卡拉比的事時我有多驚訝吧
about Muhammed Kalabi just...

208
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,500
你的電話隨后就到
moments before you did.

209
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,330
情況還在發展
Situation is still unfolding.

210
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,920
在選舉日
On Election Day?

211
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,490
弗蘭西斯
Francis...

212
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,190
跟你共事真是一段獨特的經歷
it's been quite a journey working with you.

213
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,600
卡拉比溜進了國內
Kalabi slipped into the country,

214
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,740
他正策劃著一起針對
and he's planning a terrorist attack

215
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,490
田納西某個投票中心的恐怖襲擊
against a voting center in Tennessee.

216
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,430
這種說法太嚇人了
And that is a terrifying proposition.

217
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,510
我需要你在白宮
Well, I may need you to stay around

218
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,330
再多待一陣  凱茜
the White House a bit longer, Cathy,

219
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,030
直到事態平息
until this situation is resolved.

220
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,870
好的
Of course.

221
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,490
我只是說
I was only saying...

222
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,440
這一路以來很不錯了
it's been a good run.

223
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,180
說得像她能激怒我似的
As if she could ever get under my skin.

224
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,870
我現在還不用去宴會
I don't need to get to the party just yet.

225
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,820
人們伸著汗涔涔的手想要最后一次向我致敬
Sweaty palms, eager to pay me their last respects.

226
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,280
但他們真正想用的致敬方式
When what they really want to do to show their respect

227
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,120
是把所有子彈都射向我
is to empty their bullets in my body,

228
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,210
確保我死得透透的
just to make sure that I'm dead.

229
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,040
帕特  抱歉讓你久等了
Patti, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

230
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,160
哈維女士剛剛告訴我
Miss Harvey was just telling me

231
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,710
日程安排有變
that there's been a change in the schedule.

232
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,310
是啊  很不幸現在出現了緊急情況
Yes, unfortunately, we're in a bit of an emergency.

233
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,910
但我希望能盡快解決
But I hope it will be resolved soon.

234
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,020
湯姆  你好
Tom, hello.

235
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,760
-你認識耶茨先生吧  -認識
- You know Mr. Yates, don't you? - Yes,

236
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,380
黨代會上見過
we met at the convention.

237
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,120
莉安會在酒店
So LeAnn will be at the hotel.

238
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,810
要是你覺得
She can reach me

239
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,090
我應該早點而不是晚點過去的話  她會聯系我
if you feel I need to be there sooner rather than later.

240
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,590
萬一是晚點過去
In case it's later...

241
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,310
我希望你考慮一下四年后
I want you to think four years down the road.

242
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,410
-你說什么  -他們信賴你
- I'm sorry? - They trust you.

243
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,760
四年可轉瞬即逝
Four years is no time.

244
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,700
有輛車在等您
We have a car waiting.

245
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,710
我們今天還握手了
So we're shaking hands today?

246
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,260
我們還是保持那樣最好
I think it's best we keep it like that.

247
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,120
要握得像真格的一樣
Well, shake it like you mean it.

248
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,450
這樣如何
How's that?

249
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,580
你希望我直接去宴會廳嗎
So you want me to just head over to the ballroom?

250
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,210
不
No.

251
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,260
不
No.

252
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,150
我確實喜歡穿過大房間看你
I do like looking at you across a large room.

253
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,700
勝利
Victory.

254
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,920
你贏的話用這份
This is for when you win.

255
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,120
敗選演說我也寫了一份
I wrote a concession speech as well.

256
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,100
全國上下的投票點都加強了安保
With increased security at polling places across the country,

257
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,560
今年進行投票的美國人
will fewer Americans vote for the president this year

258
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,790
會不會比以往都少
than in any election in recent memory?

259
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,440
尤其受關注的是典型的搖擺州
Particular attention is being paid to typical battleground states,

260
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,200
俄亥俄和賓夕法尼亞
Ohio and Pennsylvania,

261
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,590
在這些州  投票人數成了核心問題
where voter turnout has become a central issue

262
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,700
這可能決定本次歷史性大選的結果
that could make all the difference in this historic election.

263
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,700
費城的投票率如果很低
You know, if turnout is low in Philadelphia...

264
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,790
安德伍德夫婦就輸定了
the Underwoods are going under.

265
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,760
你得想個更好的開場白
You need a better in than that.

266
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,810
你看起像是被折騰得不輕
You look like you've been chewed up and shit out twice today.

267
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,440
似乎難以集中精力
Seems like you're having trouble focusing.

268
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,800
你看過醫生嗎
You ever see a doctor about that?

269
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,570
什么
What?

270
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,360
因為我自信可以診斷你是
Oh, 'cause I feel pretty comfortable diagnosing you

271
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,060
心事太重了
with too much on your fucking mind.

272
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,650
我請你喝一杯吧  我在慶祝
Let me get you something real. I'm celebrating.

273
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,370
兩杯奧本威士忌
Two Oban.

274
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,410
慶祝什么
Celebrating what?

275
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,360
你知道湯姆·漢默施密特的長期調查組吧
You know Tom Hammerschmidt's long lead team?

276
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,170
你面前的這位是新加入的成員
You're looking at the newest member.

277
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,350
那人真是永不放棄
That guy never gives up.

278
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,670
我告訴你他想干什么  你給他提供消息
I tell you what he's up to, feed him things from you.

279
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,630
現在談交換條件  有點晚了吧
Don't you think it's a little late for quid pro quo?

280
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,790
安德伍德夫婦仍有勝算
The Underwoods could still win.

281
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,930
等著瞧吧
We'll see.

282
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,260
無論如何  你都還有幾個月
Either way, you still have a couple more months.

283
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,260
也對
Yeah.

284
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,930
我會找到地方落腳的
I'll land somewhere.

285
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,120
你的電話
Your phone.

286
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,600
今天有人能讓我消停一會兒嗎
Can somebody give me a second today, you know?

287
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,470
該死  失陪一下
Shit. Excuse me.

288
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:50,790
你好
Hello?

289
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,810
有報告稱...
...while reports are coming in

290
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,690
諾克斯維爾一投票中心可能發生了襲擊
of a possible attack at a Knoxville voting center.

291
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,420
我們來看看直播...
Now, let's take a live look...

292
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,230
田納西州  田納西怎么了
Tennessee? What's going on in Tennessee?

293
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,780
目前場面非常混亂
...it's a very chaotic scene at the moment.

294
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,320
什么
What?

295
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,250
目前情況很復雜
...there's a lot happening right now.

296
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,570
當然  警方正在
Police are... are, of course,

297
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,310
試圖安撫民眾  并保證大家的安全
trying to keep everyone calm and safe here.

298
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,860
我們將為您帶來
And we will bring you...

299
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,870
你到底去哪了
Where the hell were you?

300
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,910
田納西  田納西到底怎么回事
Tennessee. What the hell's going on in Tennessee?

301
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,820
穆罕默德·卡拉比  
Muhammed Kalabi,

302
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,030
敘利亞哈里發國的  燒肖像的那個
the ICO guy from Syria who burned the effigy.

303
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,700
有什么計劃
What's the plan?

304
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,730
今晚我站在你們面前  作為副總統候選人
I stand before you this evening as vice presidential candidate,

305
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,370
作為美國的第一夫人
as the First Lady of the United States,

306
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,430
最重要的  也作為這個偉大國家的一名公民
and most of all... as a citizen of this great country.

307
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,980
雖然諾克斯維爾投票中心發生了暴力事件
Despite the violent incident at the voting center in Knoxville,

308
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,160
此時此刻  總統正在進行處理
which the president is attending to as we speak,

309
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,080
我們想向任何在考慮不投票的各位保證
we want to assure anyone who's considering not voting

310
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,910
現在投票不僅是安全的  更是你們的責任
that it is not only safe to vote, it is your duty to do so.

311
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,670
不管你是民主黨人
It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat.

312
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,760
還是共和黨人
It doesn't matter if you're a Republican.

313
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,310
我們的國家需要你們今天去投票
Our nation needs you to vote today.

314
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,950
暴力不能導致冷漠
Violence cannot beget apathy.

315
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,960
我們必須發聲
We must make our voices heard.

316
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,870
賽斯
Seth!

317
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,200
有目擊者稱  諾克斯維爾投票中心  
Witnesses report an FBI and Homeland presence

318
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,910
出現了聯調局和國安局的人
at the Knoxville voting center.

319
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,490
你覺得這事跟哈利發國有關嗎
Do you believe this is ICO-related?

320
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,520
賽斯  拜托
Seth, please! Come on.

321
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,950
-聯調局沒有回應  -你也別亂說  吉娜
- And the FBI isn't talking. - Neither are you, Gina.

322
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,900
這可不是發布會  我并沒做相關安排
This isn't a presser, because I didn't schedule one.

323
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,200
-我們只想知道  -兩次了  吉娜
- We're just trying to find out-- - That's two, Gina.

324
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,040
如果你想三振出局  我很樂意效勞
If you're looking for a strikeout, I'm happy to oblige.

325
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,890
不想嗎  很好
No? Good.

326
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,860
目前不接受提問
There's no questions at this time.

327
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,660
第一夫人的聲明里該說的都說了
The First Lady's statement stands as is.

328
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,400
我得到田納西的最新情況就會通報
I will have updates for you on Tennessee as I get them.

329
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,300
所有人都清楚了嗎  謝謝
Is everyone clear? Thank you.

330
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,520
賽斯
Seth!

331
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,840
我聽說一切都亂套了
I'm told everything just went wrong.

332
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,410
-聯調局派了拆彈部隊的人  -但是  米切
- The FBI had the bomb guys there... - But, Mitch...

333
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,130
天啊
...for crying out loud!

334
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,620
傷情僅僅是擦傷和瘀傷
...injuries didn't go beyond scrapes and bruises.

335
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,170
這我可不確定  肖娜
Oh, I don't know about that, Shawna.

336
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,860
有12人被送往了醫院
Twelve people were taken to the hospital.

337
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,380
格林的預計到達時間有了嗎
Look, is there any status on Green's ETA?

338
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,660
-斯圖爾特州務卿和我  -好的  請稍等
- Secretary Stewart and I... - Yes. Just a moment, sir.

339
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,810
-無法做出決斷  除非  -您得接這通電話
- ...cannot make a determination without-- - You need to take this.

340
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,710
什么  什么
What? What?

341
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,100
又怎么了
What the hell is this?

342
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,320
你好
Hello.

343
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,250
州長  我是馬克·厄舍
Governor. Mark Usher here.

344
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,780
我們應該在太陽谷的會議上見過
I think we met at the conference in Sun Valley.

345
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,010
對  沒錯
Yes, that's right.

346
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,750
真希望能在更好的情況下打來
Well, I wish I were calling under better circumstances.

347
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,990
我想知道您有什么需求
I wanted to know what you're going to need.

348
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,430
我可以盡快安排人過去  以防您...
I can get some excellent people down there fast in case you...

349
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,800
您似乎需要額外的安保  或者
you're feeling like you need the extra security or...

350
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
您還在聽嗎
You there?

351
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,680
在  我在
I'm right here, yeah.

352
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,150
幾分鐘前我跟肖娜談過了
I spoke to Shawna a few minutes ago,

353
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,480
我們一致認為絕不能讓選舉受影響
and we agreed that we absolutely cannot disrupt this election.

354
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,590
你聯系了我的州務卿
You called my secretary of state?

355
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,590
是她聯系了我
Well, she called me.

356
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,310
她是田納西州黨領袖  跟你一樣
She is a leader of the party in Tennessee. As are you.

357
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,960
需要我提醒你  先生  你那兒是共和黨州
Do I need to remind you, sir, that yours is a red state,

358
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,770
共和黨人都指望著你呢嗎
and every Republican in it is counting on you?

359
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,150
-謝謝  厄舍先生  -等一下
- Thank you, Mr. Usher. - Now, hold on.

360
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,910
肖娜只想問
Shawna just wanted to ask

361
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,400
能做什么  做不了什么
what can be done and what can't be done.

362
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,510
她跟我們其他人一樣  也在想辦法
She's like the rest of us, trying to figure this thing out.

363
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,260
因為目前尚無法確定的
Because of the scale of a possible threat

364
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,380
潛在威脅的規模
which we're still trying to determine,

365
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,920
也因為這些投票中心的重要性
and because of the importance of these, uh, voting centers,

366
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,800
我們請求州長宣布
we're asking the governor to declare

367
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,420
-進入緊急狀態  -威爾  你坐會兒吧
- a state of emergency... - Will, could you please sit?

368
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,910
這樣我們才能...
...so that we can provide more...

369
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,280
我不喜歡這樣
I don't like it.

370
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,180
3點那波說田納西無論如何都是我們的了
Three o'clock wave said Tennessee's locked up, no matter what.

371
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,250
...發生在這里的事件
...into the event that took place here...

372
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,430
親愛的  大家都看不到了
Love, no one can see.

373
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,110
怎么回事
What the hell?

374
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,000
可能會讓人不安
...be potentially disturbing.

375
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,840
有炸彈時狗不會叫的
They don't bark when there's a bomb.

376
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,180
什么意思"不會叫"
What do you mean, "They don't bark"?

377
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,410
有炸彈時狗不會叫  總統先生
The canine units don't bark when there's a bomb, Mr. President.

378
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,410
嗯  但整棟樓的人都聽到了
Yeah, but the whole building heard it.

379
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,920
他們的訓練是檢測到炸彈就坐下
They're trained to sit down when they detect a bomb.

380
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,990
-它們坐下了嗎  -沒有
- So did they sit down? - No.

381
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,440
那就是沒炸彈
Then there was no bomb.

382
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,270
我們認為狗叫是因為受到了刺激
We think the barking was provoked.

383
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,140
刺激  格林局長  這真是夠了
Provoked? Director Green, that'll be enough.

384
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,770
這些狗是我們最后的防線  先生
These dogs are our last line of defense, sir.

385
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,010
我覺得哈里發國今天闖進去了
I think ICO got in there today.

386
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,020
幸好他們沒引爆炸彈
And thank God they didn't get a bomb off,

387
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,580
但不管他們讓什么人混了進去
but whatever operative they got in there,

388
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,150
我覺得是去引發暴亂的
I think, was used to provoke the riot.

389
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,260
我說夠了
I said that is enough.

390
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,900
你覺得哈里發國會闖進樓里
You think ICO got all the way in that building

391
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,790
然后又決定還是不引爆炸彈了嗎
and then just decided not to set off a bomb?

392
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,240
-這個...  -我們不能影響投票
- Well, there are-- - We are not going to disrupt the voting.

393
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,120
米切  你好好勸勸他
Mitch, would you please talk some sense into him?

394
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,630
-我  -如果不暫停投票
- I-- - If we don't suspend,

395
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,480
局里無法確保中心的安全
the Bureau cannot guarantee the safety of these centers.

396
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,810
不可接受  找到卡拉比
Unacceptable. Find Kalabi.

397
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,080
州長不會希望
The governor does not wanna

398
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,630
在這么晚的時候頒發宵禁令
have to institute a curfew this late in the game.

399
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,080
-米切  -是  先生
- And, Mitch... - Uh, yes, sir.

400
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,840
你不能關閉投票
...you are not closing the polls.

401
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,350
你覺得我們該關嗎
You think we should?

402
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,070
我沒法發表意見
I can't weigh in on this.

403
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,910
我得跟肖娜談談
I need to talk to Shawna.

404
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,910
公眾還要承受多少丑聞
How many scandals should the public be expected to endure

405
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,710
才會說"夠了"
before they say, "Enough"?

406
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,950
會說"我不出門了"
Before they say, "I'm staying home"?

407
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,360
會對國家完全喪失信心
Before they lose complete faith in this democratic republic?

408
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,670
上次出現這樣的趨勢
This is a trend that dates back at least

409
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,870
是尼克松躲過牢獄之災的時候
to when Nixon avoided jail time.

410
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,710
好了  結束
Okay, we're out.

411
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,900
-真不錯  -我不需要粉絲  肖恩
- You're good. - I don't need fans, Sean.

412
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,890
只是真誠的欣賞
Just genuine appreciation.

413
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,170
喝一杯嗎  一杯是酒  一杯不是
Would you like a drink? One is brown and one is not.

414
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,590
-今晚會很漫長  -我聽說不是
- It's gonna be a long night. - That's not what I hear.

415
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,580
那么  田納西
So, Tennessee...

416
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,710
是問題所在
Is the question.

417
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,710
怎么樣
And?

418
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,160
我的男伴什么都不知道
My date knew nothing.

419
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,750
你在到處問了嗎
Are you making the rounds?

420
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,790
這里的人比我一般接觸的年齡要大
Crowd's a little older than I'm used to, but...

421
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,110
但是  沒錯  他們話多  卻沒什么料
yes, they're a talkative bunch... that don't say much.

422
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,570
我要酒
I'll take the brown one.

423
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,860
那是帕特里夏·惠特克  民主黨全國委員會主席
That's Patricia Whittaker over there. Chairperson of the DNC.

424
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,370
她有次在奧馬哈一家酒吧里扇了我個耳光
She slapped me once in a bar in Omaha.

425
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,900
我也不知道為什么
For the life of me, I can't tell you why.

426
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,750
田納西州有問題
There's something wrong with Tennessee.

427
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,100
你的男伴要么在撒謊  要么在抵賴
Your date is either lying or denying.

428
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,640
這是什么意思
What did you mean by this?

429
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,400
演講背后的字
On the back of the speech?

430
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,390
沒事  別提了
Nothing. Forget it.

431
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,120
"還有時間"
"There's still time"?

432
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,770
還有時間做什么
There's still time for what?

433
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,350
你在干什么
What are you doing?

434
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,140
你和你丈夫
You and your husband.

435
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,170
準備贏得選舉
Getting ready to win an election.

436
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,180
我看到你的樣子了
I see the way you're acting.

437
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,330
你知道我們今天打算贏得選舉嗎
Do you realize we have every intention of winning today?

438
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,370
當然
Sure.

439
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,770
但然后呢
But then what?

440
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,460
我以前會去緬因州的一間小木屋
I used to go to this cabin... up in Maine.

441
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,030
窗戶關不嚴實
The windows don't close properly.

442
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,610
整個夏天都能聞到大海的氣味兒
You can smell the ocean all summer long.

443
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,990
我覺得你還是去宴會廳吧
I do think it's better you go to the ballroom.

444
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,000
如果你尚未投票  我保證  你會有機會的
If you have not voted, I assure you, you will get the chance.

445
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,640
但出于良心
But I cannot, in good conscience,

446
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,280
我不能在確保安全前  允許投票繼續
allow balloting to continue until I am satisfied that it is safe.

447
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,840
為此  隨著夜晚將至
To that end, as nightfall approaches,

448
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,790
我要宣布今晚
I am announcing an enforced,

449
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,090
執行全州宵禁
state-wide curfew, effective tonight.

450
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,250
如果你中部時間晚8點30還未回家
If you are not in your home by 8:30 p.m. central time,

451
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,920
或是東部時間9點30
or by 9:30 in the eastern parts of this state,

452
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,180
你將被拘禁甚至逮捕
you will be subject to detention and possible arrest.

453
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,690
這是怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

454
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,450
我們會贏下賓州和俄亥俄州  就這么回事
What's going on is we're gonna win Pennsylvania and Ohio.

455
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,450
那么你就超過270了
That puts you over 270.

456
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,400
投票還在繼續  大家還在投票
The polls are still open. People are still voting.

457
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,930
我的直覺是那些票屬于我們
My gut says they're ours.

458
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,520
沒有田納西也272了
That's 272 without Tennessee.

459
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,360
那混蛋暫停了投票
That asshole's suspending the vote.

460
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,960
那得由他的州務卿決定  她是我們的人
That's up to his secretary of state, and she's on our side.

461
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,210
-都這樣了她還有的選嗎  -州長  聽我說
- She's gonna have a choice after this? - Governor, listen to me.

462
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,480
我們還要讓弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
I mean, how long do we let Francis Underwood

463
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,790
耍這種手段多久啊
get away with this kind of shit? Huh? How long?

464
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,350
他不會得逞的
He won't get away with it.

465
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,310
不會的
He won't.

466
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,380
剛剛是田納西州長
That was Tennessee governor...

467
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,100
相信我
Trust me.

468
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,020
宣布全州宵禁
...announcing a state-wide curfew.

469
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,670
扯淡
Bullshit.

470
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,860
全州的投票中心都在關閉
Voting centers all across the state are being shut down,

471
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,250
中部時間8點30或東部時間9點30前
and anyone not in their homes 8:30 central time,

472
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,490
還沒回家的人
or 9:30...

473
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,090
費城5點的一波  我們應該贏定了
Five o'clock wave from Philly. I think we're home.

474
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,880
...被拘禁甚至逮捕  這則公告...
...detention and possible arrest. This announcement...

475
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,200
田納西的事簡直瘋了
That Tennessee shit is crazy.

476
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,290
瘋狂事經常有
Crazy shit happens all the time.

477
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,060
這么湊巧
This convenient?

478
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,240
少來什么陰謀論了
Spare me the conspiracy talk.

479
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,910
政府沒那么大威力  或能力
The government's not that powerful... or competent.

480
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,490
總得問問
A man can ask.

481
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,220
目前安德伍德255  康威245
We're looking at 255 Underwood, 245 Conway.

482
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,690
賓州和俄亥俄呢
Pennsylvania and Ohio?

483
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,130
還是太接近  但就要6點了
Still too close, but it's almost six o' clock.

484
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,280
等我們把田納西州從康威變成搖擺
When we change Tennessee from Conway to undecided--

485
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,930
那么康威會下跌
That brings Conway down

486
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,810
-到...  -234  還是太接近
- to-- - Two thirty-four. Still way too close.

487
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,850
是啊  我們尚不知道
Yes, but we don't yet know

488
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,330
他已經拿下了西部州
that he's locked in the western states.

489
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,250
那些州十年沒變了
Those states have been locked up for ten years.

490
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,760
紅的  紅的  紅的  到今晚結束又會是紅的
Red, red, red and they'll be red again by the end of the night.

491
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,780
就看賓州和俄亥俄了
It's gonna come down to Pennsylvania and Ohio.

492
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,390
康威需要兩個州  你只需要一個
Conway needs both. You only need one.

493
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,110
馬修斯
Matthews?

494
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,340
他會反抗  可能還會公開表態
He'll push back. He might even go public.

495
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,650
另外五個州呢
What about the other five states in play?

496
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,600
律師在候著
The lawyers are waiting.

497
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,120
我們可以就壓制投票提出訴訟  但是
We can generate lawsuits, argue suppression, but...

498
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,350
還是不夠
Still not enough.

499
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,630
奧姆斯泰德在俄亥俄情況不樂觀  他很不高興
Olmstead's losing in Ohio, and he's not taking it well.

500
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,560
我今早跟他的幕僚長塔妮婭通過話
I spoke with his chief of staff, Tanya, this morning.

501
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,460
他在州北的情況很糟
He's getting clobbered in the northern part of the state.

502
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,890
克利夫蘭的低投票率也是個問題
Low turnout in Cleveland's not helping.

503
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,330
但他還能扭轉局勢
But he could still pull it out.

504
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,160
他贏不了的  他也清楚
He's not going to win and he knows it.

505
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,670
我們還有多少時間
How much time do we have?

506
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,430
俄亥俄州兩小時后關閉  大部分人今早都投票了
Ohio closes in two hours. And most people voted this morning.

507
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,710
有些州局勢已定了
Some of these states are baked in already.

508
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,100
克萊爾和我要單獨談談
Claire and I need the room for a moment.

509
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,510
是  先生
Yes, sir.

510
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,000
-莉安  我們再聯絡你  -是  先生
- LeAnn, we'll call you back. - Yes, sir.

511
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,030
你為什么讓他出去
Why did you ask him to leave?

512
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,060
因為我想再看著你的眼睛一次
Because I just wanted to look in your eyes one more time

513
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,840
再決定要不要動手
before we do this.

514
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,040
弗蘭西斯
Francis...

515
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,040
我們做吧
we're doing this.

516
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,060
他救不了我們  他發明了任期限制
He can't save us. He invented term limits.

517
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,420
道格
Doug!

518
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,020
再給我接莉安·哈維
Get me LeAnn Harvey back on the phone.

519
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,190
是  先生
Yes, sir.

520
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,170
對俄亥俄做該做的吧
Do what you have to do with Ohio.

521
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,080
我就去
I'm on it.

522
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,220
莉安  讓律師準備
LeAnn, get the lawyers ready.

523
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,200
-我不能這么做  -你可以的
- I can't do this. - Yes, you can.

524
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,360
-不不  -而且得馬上完成
- No, no, no, no, no! - And it needs to be done quickly.

525
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,340
太草率了
It's too sloppy.

526
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,080
是莉安打的電話  為什么是你來
Why are you here if LeAnn called me?

527
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,330
我還要向你解釋
Do I really have to explain to you

528
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,900
你不這么做的后果嗎
what will happen if you don't do this?

529
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,730
我不在乎他輸不輸
I don't care if he loses.

530
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,320
我不是指選舉  我是說你
I'm not talking about the election. I'm talking about you.

531
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,780
你會怎么樣
What will happen to you?

532
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,480
你有你需要的一切了  鏈接已經發給你了
You have everything you need. The Pastebin link was sent to you.

533
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,600
莉安呢
Where's LeAnn?

534
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,700
她不在  我時間不多了
She's not here, and I'm short on time.

535
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,600
州長  對不起  但這事只有一個辦法
Governor, I'm sorry, but there's only one way to play this.

536
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,920
我們需要你撤掉那三郡的
We need you to pull your poll workers

537
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,420
投票工作人員和投票機
and your machines from those three counties.

538
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,710
共和黨人會宰了我的  那是他們的地盤
The Republicans would crucify me. They own that area.

539
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,760
但那幾個選區
But those are the precincts

540
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,970
最有可能遭遇威脅
that are most likely to be threatened.

541
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,350
"可能"  你什么...
"Likely to be"? Hey, what are you...

542
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,870
這是什么意思
What are we talking about here?

543
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,640
恐怖襲擊可能性
Terrorist chatter.

544
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,090
針對田納西州的
Related to Tennessee?

545
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,190
是的
Yes, sir.

546
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,810
我可不能光聽你空口一詞
Well, I'm gonna need more than your word on that.

547
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,490
對不起  但情報是機密  州長
Oh, I'm sorry, but the intelligence is classified, Governor.

548
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,060
那給我權限
Then read me in.

549
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:56,960
我沒親眼
'Cause I'm not doing this

550
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,010
看到證據是不會這么做的
without seeing tangible proof with my own eyes.

551
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,170
你去告訴弗蘭西斯吧
You can tell Francis.

552
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,980
另外  因為俄亥俄州投票率這么低
The other thing is, with Ohio turnout so low,

553
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,940
可能會有人指控你刻意壓制投票
people could accuse you of engaging in voter suppression.

554
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,860
什么
What?

555
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,640
投票中心和警衛隊都是總統的主意
The voting centers and the troops were the president's idea.

556
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,160
但你同意了
But you signed on to them,

557
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,760
這才重要
and that's what matters.

558
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,650
你要輸掉選舉了  先生
You're losing your election, sir.

559
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,960
這很明顯
The signs are clear.

560
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,030
民主黨失去一位州長就太可惜了
That'd be a real shame for the Democrats to be down a governor.

561
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,720
但現在發生了種種情況
But here we have this confluence of events.

562
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,010
一方面是你不盡如人意的選情
Your disappointing returns on one hand

563
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,670
一方面是恐怖襲擊的可能
and the chatter on the other.

564
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,810
我需要證據  否則  人們會覺得
I need proof. Otherwise, people will think--

565
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,680
你為了贏得選舉  而關閉了
That you shut down voting in Republican precincts

566
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,600
共和黨選區的投票站
to guarantee your own win.

567
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,880
幸好
Now I'd say it's a good thing

568
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,480
國安局剛收到了可靠的消息
that the NSA just picked up on some credible chatter.

569
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,380
這危險的世界讓你別無選擇
This dangerous world left you no choice.

570
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,640
謝謝
Thank you.

571
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,480
州長  我剛剛拿到了機密情報
Governor, I was just handed the classified intel.

572
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,910
您在加密服務器上嗎
Are you on a secure server?

573
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,130
-在  -請稍等
- Yes, I am. - Please hold.

574
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,930
我這就把文件發給您
I'm sending the files over right now.

575
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,840
您的決定是正確的  先生
You're doing the right thing, sir.

576
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,700
我們可不能背上血債
We don't want blood on our hands.

577
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,760
我不管他們把投票機搬哪去
I don't care where they're taking the voting machines.

578
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,710
你就盯緊...
Just stay...

579
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,210
有必要的話把你自己綁在投票機上
You chain yourself to one of them if you have to.

580
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,900
好  我去找個俄亥俄州的法官
Good. I'm gonna find an Ohio judge.

581
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,210
俄亥俄州的投票中心已經關了近兩個小時了
Voting centers in Ohio have been closed for almost two hours.

582
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,410
康威已經去找法官了
And Conway's got a judge.

583
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,790
他在申請重開投票中心
He's petitioning to reopen.

584
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,400
但就算投票中心繼續關閉
But even if they stay closed,

585
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,650
俄亥俄州能幫我們達成目的嗎
would Ohio get us there?

586
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,370
其他州可能還有戲
Other states might be in play.

587
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,720
壓制投票的傳言也出現了  但...
Rumblings of suppression are out there, although...

588
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,760
還有什么別的情況
Well, what else do we have?

589
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,400
愛達荷州  出現恐嚇選民的事件
Voter intimidation in Idaho.

590
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,850
怎么樣  我要不要回話讓他們提交訴訟
What do you think? Should I call them back and have them file?

591
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,890
我看行
I like it.

592
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,900
這樣和田納西的事呼應效果最好
It has the most resonance with what's happened in Tennessee.

593
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,480
我還希望佐治亞有議員站出來
I also like an assemblyman we have in Georgia.

594
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,820
馬里蘭有個眾議員
There's a congressman in Maryland.

595
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,240
馬里蘭也是沒要求派警衛隊的州之一
That's one of the states that didn't request the troops.

596
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,400
等等  我們需不需要普通選民出來表態
But wait. Don't we need something coming from a voter?

597
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,960
密西西比有個選民
There's a voter in Mississippi.

598
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,720
她說她嚇得不敢去投票了
Said she was too scared to vote.

599
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,880
新聞基本就是告訴她不要去投票
That TV essentially told her not to go.

600
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,800
這就有點牽強了吧
Well, that sounds like a bit of a stretch.

601
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,220
可能對我們有利  先生
That could be a plus for us, sir.

602
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,730
能很好地打開局面
Really open things up.

603
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,420
如果俄亥俄繼續關閉
If Ohio stays shut,

604
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,890
可能會引發連鎖反應
there could be a ripple effect.

605
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,970
這都是前無古人的做法
This is all uncharted territory.

606
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,110
那好  佐治亞和馬里蘭待會兒再說
All right, let's put a pin in Georgia and Maryland,

607
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,650
讓俄亥俄的投票中心繼續關閉
and let's keep the Ohio voting centers shut down,

608
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,340
看看有什么結果
and see where that gets us.

609
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,070
康威已經拿下賓夕法尼亞
Pennsylvania has gone to Conway.

610
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,240
就算雙方在俄亥俄仍然難分勝負
Even if Ohio is still too close to call

611
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,770
總統在西北部取勝的話
and the President does well in the Northwest,

612
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,750
他仍無法抵消康威在南部取得的優勢
he can't counter Conway's gains in the South,

613
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,260
而那里曾是安德伍德的地盤
in what would typically be Underwood territory.

614
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,020
人民已經做出了選擇
The people have spoken.

615
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,730
真是難以置信
I can't believe this.

616
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,240
總統因故不能前來  他向各位表示歉意
The President apologizes that he couldn't be here tonight,

617
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,350
但他想讓我告訴各位  敗選已經不可避免了
but he wanted me to let you know that concession is inevitable.

618
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,900
還有那么多州票沒計完
All the states haven't been called yet.

619
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,560
總統還有時間想辦法...
The president still has time if he needs...

620
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,010
各位  我們已經盡力了
Guys, we fought a good fight.

621
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,150
可是很不幸  實情就是這樣
But, unfortunately, this is the reality of the situation.

622
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,440
天啊
Jesus.

623
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,180
看來這就算完了
Well, I guess that's that.

624
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,210
喂  我是威爾
Yeah, this is Will.

625
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,000
我想第一個對你說
I wanted to be the first to tell you

626
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,190
恭喜你  當選總統先生
congratulations, Mr. President-elect.

627
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
謝謝你  總統先生
Well, thank you, Mr. President.

628
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,030
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}2000年大選夜  戈爾先向小布什認輸
但是第二天又反悔了

629
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,030
怎么  你以為我沒從戈爾那里學到教訓嗎
What? You think I learned nothing from Al Gore?

630
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,220
我們這場選戰可真是激烈萬分啊  是不是
We kept them on the edge of their seats, didn't we?

631
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,260
我想這也說明我們的體制運轉良好
I guess that means the system is working.

632
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,790
我也這么看
I guess it does.

633
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,120
你是我遇到過的最強勁的對手了  弗蘭西斯
You're about as tough an opponent as they come, Francis.

634
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,060
我經驗豐富啊
Well, I've had a lot of practice.

635
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,050
請一定要轉達我對漢娜和孩子們的問候
Now, you be sure to give my regards to Hannah and the children.

636
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,880
謝謝你  總統先生  我
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm...

637
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,680
我在不久的將來  肯定會向你討教的
sure I'll be calling on you for advice in the very near future.

638
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,540
我萬分期待
Well, I look forward to that.

639
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,720
他認輸了
He conceded?

640
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,360
對
Yeah.

641
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,270
我們成功了
We did it.

642
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,430
我們做到了
We did it.

643
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,640
打擾一下  先生
Excuse me, sir.

644
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,770
布洛哈特將軍正在來套房的路上
General Brockhart is on his way over to the suite.

645
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,780
謝謝
Thank you.

646
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,940
有消息源稱  不久前
Sources are telling us that Francis Underwood

647
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,180
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德致電康威州長
conceded to Governor Conway on the phone

648
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,980
承認落選
only a short time ago.

649
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,800
我猜測他們收到的數字跟我們的相符
I suspect their numbers are matching up with ours,

650
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,760
那么俄亥俄將被共和黨收入囊中
which would put Ohio in the Republican column.

651
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,370
足以讓威廉·康威
Enough to make William Conway

652
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:46,250
成為美國下一任總統
the next president of the United States.

653
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,370
-你好  -塔妮婭  讓他接電話
- Hello? - Tanya, put him on the line.

654
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,830
等一下  我看看能不能找到他
Hang on, let me see if I can get him.

655
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,150
他是我的州務卿
He's my Secretary of State,

656
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,470
他有權這么做
and he has the power to do it.

657
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,230
那你得告訴他該做什么
Well, then you need to tell him what to do.

658
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,850
他說他可以重開選站將投票日延長到明天
He says he can reopen and extend the voting day into tomorrow.

659
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,090
告訴他這不安全
Tell him it's not safe.

660
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,160
我說了  道格
I've done that, Doug!

661
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,760
他顯然不在乎
Obviously, he doesn't seem to care.

662
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,740
安德伍德已經認輸了
Underwood conceded already.

663
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,180
別放你的州務卿出去
Do not trot out your Secretary of State.

664
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,400
投票不能重啟
Voting cannot resume.

665
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,310
如果你還有什么疑慮
Now, if you have any doubt,

666
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,950
那也給我忍著
you swallow it right now.

667
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,040
我擔心的是黨派
I'm worried about the party.

668
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,270
這對黨派的影響
What this could do to the party.

669
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,670
羅杰  這比黨派重要多了
Roger, this is so much bigger than the party.

670
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,540
我覺得我把我的事業都賭上了
I feel like I'm risking my entire career here.

671
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,550
是的
You are.

672
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,180
如果你不照我說的做
And if you don't do what I'm telling you,

673
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,650
你的前途就完了
it's over for sure.

674
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,330
怎么了
What?

675
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,010
他還要耗多久
How many hours is it gonna take him

676
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,170
才肯在公眾面前說出那幾個字
to spit out the fucking words in public?

677
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,700
不管了  去他的規程
Screw this. Screw protocol.

678
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,680
我這就要過去
I'm heading down there.

679
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,190
-不  不行  -已經到第二天了  馬克
- No, you're not. - It's already tomorrow, Mark.

680
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,370
這簡直不可理喻
I mean, this is insane.

681
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,210
-我想發表講話  -俄亥俄州還沒完
- I want to make my speech! - Ohio is still in play.

682
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,340
什么
What?

683
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,270
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

684
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,220
持續的恐怖主義威脅帶來的恐慌...
...fear from continued terrorist threats

685
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,840
和田納西州傳出的令人不安的消息
and the disturbing news coming out of Tennessee...

686
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,080
讓我不得不關閉幾個我們的投票站
I was forced to close a number of our polling places.

687
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,970
操
Fuck me.

688
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,870
經與俄亥俄州州務卿達成一致
And in accordance with the Ohio secretary of state,

689
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,960
投票在進一步通知前先行暫停
the vote is suspended until further notice.

690
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,210
我知道這會讓我們的選民疑慮重重
Now, I know this may put our electorates in question...

691
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,290
但我別無選擇
...but I had no choice.

692
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,570
新澤西可能不認證
New Jersey might not certify.

693
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,780
出現了一些異常情況
There's been a variety of irregularities.

694
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,430
伊利諾伊也是
Same with Illinois.

695
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,040
看起來內華達也有異動
Looks like Nevada's making noises, too.

696
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,230
感覺似曾相識  你有同感嗎
I'm having déjà vu. You ever get that?

697
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,300
你真的在問我似曾相識的感覺嗎
Are you seriously asking me about déjà vu?

698
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,170
算了  已經沒感覺了
Never mind. It's gone.

699
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,590
你從未有過似曾相識的感覺嗎  人人都會有
You never get déjà vu? Everybody does.

700
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,600
我沒有
I don't.

701
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,810
別那么焦慮  道格
Don't look so worried, Doug.

702
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,750
你就是那一瞬間感覺很熟悉
You just felt familiar for a second.

703
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,580
已經過去了
It's over.

704
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,190
現在  總統選舉結果未定
Now, the presidency hangs in the balance.

705
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,940
至少六個州將不能在2016的選舉夜
At least six states will not have certified vote totals

706
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,070
認證計票結果
on Election Night 2016.

707
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,280
晚上好
Good evening.

708
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,600
我猜我該說早上好
I guess I should say good morning.

709
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,570
威爾很希望他能親自出鏡
Will wishes he could be here himself...

710
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,880
但我們獲知那有違規章
but we've been advised that goes against protocol.

711
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,150
我知道...
I know...

712
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,980
你們很失望
you're disappointed.

713
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,370
你介意用失望這個詞嗎
Are you okay with the word disappointed?

714
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,460
我們不該提到他們的憤怒嗎
Shouldn't we acknowledge their outrage?

715
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,240
我覺得我們應該小心處理
I'd say we should tread lightly.

716
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,780
目前我們只想請他們保持耐心
For now, we're just asking for their patience.

717
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,610
好  我們拍吧
Okay, let's do it.

718
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,270
這個國家就沒有無聊的時候
Never a dull moment in this country.

719
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,910
威爾很希望他能親自出鏡
Will wishes he could be here himself,

720
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:05,770
但我們獲知那有違規章
but we've been advised that would go against protocol.

721
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,480
我知道你們很失望
I know you're disappointed

722
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,250
你們所期待的改變
that the change you were hoping for...

723
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,670
你們所投票支持的改變
...that you voted for,

724
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,790
得再等一段時間
has to wait a little longer.

725
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,390
最終  這沒有定論的選舉之夜
And, finally, a night of electoral indecision,

726
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,070
幾乎每個州都提起了訴訟
with lawsuits being filed in nearly every state,

727
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,150
為它畫上句號的是檀香山市長
has ended with the mayor of Honolulu,

728
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,410
最后一個關閉了投票
in the last state to close its polls,

729
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,090
并拒絕承認選舉結果
refusing to honor the results of the election

730
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,760
還提起了訴訟
and filing a lawsuit.

731
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,250
夏威夷是我們這邊的嗎
Was Hawaii one of ours?

732
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,100
應該不是
No, I don't think so.

733
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,840
克萊爾  能幫我個忙嗎
Claire, could you do me a little favor?

734
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,680
我頭很痛
I have a splitting headache.

735
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,380
你能揉揉我的太陽穴嗎
Could you rub my temples for a moment?

736
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,420
當然
Of course.

737
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,430
不  其實是我眼睛這里疼
No, actually the pain is right behind my eyes.

738
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:14,250
你能...給我揉揉眼睛嗎
Could you just... rub my eyes for me?

739
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,520
但是你討厭那樣
But you hate that.

740
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,630
我知道  但是這次我應該會喜歡
I know, but I think I'll like it this time.

741
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,640
你可以用力點
You can do it harder.

742
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,560
再用力點
Even harder than that.

743
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,300
走出這一步就沒有回頭路了
There's no coming back from this.

744
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,640
我很清楚我們要做什么
I know exactly what we're about to do.

745
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,920
如果我們失敗了  后果要我們兩個承擔
If we fail, it's on both of us.

746
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,900
我是不能保護你的
I won't be able to protect you.

747
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,860
那就如釋重負了
And what a relief that will be...

748
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,530
對我們兩個都是
for both of us.

749
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,320
美國人民不知道什么對他們才是最好的
The American people don't know what's best for them.

750
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,100
我知道
I do.

751
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,300
我很清楚他們需要什么
I know exactly what they need.

752
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,420
他們就像小孩子  克萊爾
They're like little children, Claire.

753
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,030
我們從未有過的孩子
Children we never had.

754
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,360
我們得抓著他們黏糊糊的手指
We have to hold their sticky fingers

755
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,920
擦干凈他們的臟嘴
and wipe their filthy mouths.

756
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,300
教他們分辨是非
Teach them right from wrong.

757
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,360
告訴他們思考什么
Tell them what to think

758
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,370
感覺什么  想要什么
and how to feel and what to want.

759
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,580
他們甚至連書寫最瘋狂的夢想
They even need help writing their wildest dreams,

760
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,230
塑造最大的恐懼都需要幫助
crafting their worst fears.

761
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,300
他們很幸運
Lucky for them...

762
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,230
他們有我...
they have me...

763
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,590
他們有你
they have you.

764
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,420
安德伍德
Underwood.

765
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,070
安德伍德

766
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,580

772
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,930
一個國家
One nation...

773
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,360
由安德伍德執掌
Underwood.

774
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,670
道格  莉安  你們有空嗎
Doug, LeAnn... do you have a moment?

776
00:43:06,250 --> 00:44:06,250
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}按約定俗成的規則  正常的選舉程序  是在選舉結果揭曉后
落敗方向勝選方打電話認輸  然后發表落選演說  再由勝選方宣布勝利
競選雙方在這件事上  按說要本著"大局為重"的原則
就是不能讓勝負的結果影響選民對民主制度的信任
所以如果選舉中出現選票極其接近的情況  而落后方要求重新計票
落后方會面臨壓力  不能讓這個懸而未決的時間拖得太久  造成混亂
但如果有候選人想糾纏下去  拖上幾個月  也并不被法律禁止
在2016年大選夜  希拉里開始并不甘心認輸
是奧巴馬親自給她打電話  要求她認輸  她才給特朗普打電話承認落選
但她并沒去自己的選舉中心會場公開認輸  并感謝支持者
而是在午夜后派自己的競選經理去會場  告知支持者事情還沒完
媒體是在她不會親臨現場后  才得知她致電特朗普認輸了  當時場面混亂

778
00:44:06,250 --> 00:45:06,250
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}美國建國時并沒有任期限制  但是首任總統華盛頓高風亮節
擔任兩屆總統后就堅決退休  所以后來者也就約定俗成地只任兩屆
格羅弗·克利夫蘭是美國唯一一個卸任后重選再度當選的總統
他是第22任和第24任總統  都只任了一屆
但到了富蘭克林·羅斯福的時候  因為他影響很大  又遇上二戰
所以當他兩屆任期結束后決定繼續做總統時  并沒有遇到太多阻力
他的支持者稱  他繼續擔任總統是為了戰爭需要
羅斯福四次勝選  但是最后一次被選上后不久就因病去世
他的行為被認為是對民主制度的威脅
于是國會在1944年通過了憲法第22條修正案  規定總統最多只能任兩屆
在副總統中途繼位的情況下  也最多只能擔任10年
