1
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:02,765
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:04,933
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,198
<i>To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,236
<i>but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:15,670
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,741
<i>I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:21,111
<i>but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats,</i>

8
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:24,412
<i>and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:27,010
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

10
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:29,902
<i>Previously, on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:31,683
Zoom wants you dead.

12
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:36,502
<i>Do you think he can do
everything really fast?</i>

13
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,136
- How you doing, Dick?
- You're fast.

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,203
Welcome to my Earth-2.

15
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:45,543
Dad!

16
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,313
No! No!

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,625
Caitlin. That is your name, isn't it?

18
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:52,593
I hate the name Caitlin. I'm Killer Frost.

19
00:00:52,862 --> 00:00:55,030
Ronnie and Caitlin's
doppelgangers are evil?

20
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:56,331
If you're coming with us. We have to go.

21
00:00:58,968 --> 00:01:00,068
Cisco!

22
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:01,570
Get ready to close the breach for good,

23
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:02,671
Zoom's coming.

24
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:05,497
No!

25
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,774
He's not dead. He's not dead.

26
00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:17,269
Caitlin...

27
00:01:17,302 --> 00:01:19,036
He's not dead. He's not.

28
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,939
- Caitlin...
- This isn't happening.

29
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,640
This isn't happening again.

30
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:23,874
Hey, I got you.

31
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:25,677
Come on.

32
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,594
- Open it up.
- Allen...

33
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,418
- I need to go back.
- I can't do that.

34
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:35,052
- Open it up!
- Allen!

35
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:37,988
The breaches are closed.

36
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,258
All the breaches are closed.

37
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,662
Why can't we just open one of 'em?

38
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:47,950
The quark matter energy that
we used to seal the breaches,

39
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:52,010
it prevents them from
being opened, ever again.

40
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:54,617
There's no going back to our world.

41
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,979
Wait.

42
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,227
We're trapped here for good?

43
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:00,074
Yes.

44
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:07,050
No, we can't just let
Zoom get away with this.

45
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:08,851
He just murdered Jay right in front of us.

46
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:10,520
There's got to be something we can do.

47
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,621
There's not.

48
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:16,559
Not this time.

49
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:21,464
It's over.

50
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:24,834
No.

51
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,379

- WEB-DL resync by GoldenBeard -
- www.addic7ed.com -

52
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:46,088
How's she doing?

53
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:48,992
Not good. We tried to get her to go home,

54
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:51,693
but she refused to leave, so, you know,

55
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:54,662
I just sat with her until she fell asleep.

56
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:57,586
First Ronnie, now Jay.

57
00:02:57,908 --> 00:02:59,075
Yeah.

58
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:02,851
I'm afraid what this double
dose of grief is gonna do to her.

59
00:03:02,853 --> 00:03:04,920
I mean, she's pretty shell-shocked.

60
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:06,154
She'll be fine.

61
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:09,189
Snow's strong. She'll get past this.

62
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:15,216
But in the meantime, I
would not say anything to her

63
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:17,741
about her counterpart from my Earth.

64
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:19,645
That goes for Joe and Iris too.

65
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:20,746
Why?

66
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:23,215
Because you don't want
to influence their reality

67
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:24,950
in ways that should not be influenced.

68
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:27,653
Like in the same way as
when Barry time-travels?

69
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:29,087
Exactly, but also,

70
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:30,855
what's the point?

71
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:34,391
Those people are not your people.

72
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:36,762
Their lives are not your lives.

73
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,596
Never were, never will be.

74
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:40,431
Bury it. Move on.

75
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,136
Yes?

76
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:47,676
Yeah. That I can do.

77
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:53,211
Allen?

78
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:03,154
<i>So that's what we did.</i>

79
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:07,157
<i>We didn't talk about Earth-2.</i>

80
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,262
<i>We kept what happened there
between the three of us</i>

81
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:11,997
<i>and got on with our lives knowing</i>

82
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:15,298
<i>there was nothing we
could do now to stop Zoom.</i>

83
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,177
<i>Instead, we tried to just adjust</i>

84
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:28,678
<i>to our new circumstances
and cope with our losses.</i>

85
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,517
<i>Jay's death took its toll...</i>

86
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:38,706
<i>left scars on all of us,
some more than others.</i>

87
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:43,527
<i>And so to try and keep my mind</i>

88
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,597
<i>off thoughts of the
surreal other life</i>

89
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:48,432
<i>I experienced that wasn't my own,</i>

90
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:51,103
<i>I kept running, waiting for some</i>

91
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:53,205
<i>other meta-human threat
to rear its ugly head</i>

92
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:56,773
<i>and distract me from the
frustration I was feeling,</i>

93
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,943
<i>and as fate would have it,</i>

94
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:00,979
<i>I did not have to wait long.</i>

95
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:02,948
All good.

96
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:16,193
Hey, ugly! It's time for dinner.

97
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:21,599
I think Bruce has gone belly up.

98
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,337
Power down the grid.

99
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:31,975
We're gonna have to fish him out.

100
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:45,390
So this is where Waller kept
all her secret projects, huh?

101
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,758
One of many sites, I'm learning.

102
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,195
I'm sure the new Director
of A.R.G.U.S. will clean up

103
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:52,030
the mess that Waller left behind.

104
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:54,066
Easier said than done, honey.

105
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,167
Hey.

106
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:58,804
My wife can do anything
she puts her mind to.

107
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,172
<i>Code seven in Aquaria Three.</i>

108
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:02,274
<i>I repeat, code seven
in Aquaria Three.</i>

109
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,209
There's been breach in the aquarium!

110
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,177
You have an aquarium? Why?

111
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,549
What the hell?

112
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,833
Are you kidding me?

113
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,890
Seven, six, five,

114
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:40,214
four, three, two, one.

115
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:42,714
- Whoa! Yes!
- Time.

116
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:44,815
Ain't nobody faster than me.

117
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:46,017
Whoo.

118
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:48,918
I don't know about that.

119
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:50,659
Earth to Barry.

120
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,677
It's your turn, dude.

121
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,128
Yeah, it's time to show this little punk

122
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:58,763
who the fastest stack attacker alive is.

123
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:01,797
One of you guys go ahead. I'm gonna pass.

124
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:04,463
You're afraid of a little competition?

125
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:07,582
No, just not in a gaming mood right now.

126
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:12,776
Okay, well, I guess that makes me champ.

127
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,980
Right?

128
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:17,749
Anyway, I'm gonna go
meet up with some friends.

129
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,850
All right.

130
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,831
- Bye.
- Bye.

131
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:28,694
Maybe next time.

132
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:36,468
And I thought you were the competitive one

133
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:37,569
in the family.

134
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:39,137
I know, right? What's up, Bar?

135
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:40,438
Nothing. Just...

136
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,843
I don't know, I don't think
Wally likes me too much.

137
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,544
Well, we can fix that.

138
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,915
I mean, you been so busy running
between alternate realities,

139
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,551
you two haven't had a chance
to spend any time together.

140
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:54,719
What you want us to do together?

141
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:57,989
Get to know each other,

142
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,425
find something that
you guys have in common.

143
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:02,494
He's part of the family now, Bar,

144
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,963
You're gonna have to give it a chance.

145
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:06,064
I know.

146
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:09,568
All right, well, look, I'm
gonna head to bed, all right?

147
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:10,669
Mm.

148
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:12,770
- Good night.
- Good night.

149
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:18,175
Something is up with him,

150
00:08:18,177 --> 00:08:20,111
and I don't think it's just Jay's death.

151
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:21,546
He's been acting weird
ever since he came back

152
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:22,647
from Earth-2.

153
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,084
Did he say anything to you
about what happened over there?

154
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:27,718
No, not a thing. You?

155
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:33,024
Hmm.

156
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,008
Hey, so... I been thinking.

157
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,838
You've been working around the clock.

158
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,907
Maybe you want to get some rest, go home.

159
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:50,141
You know, a good night's sleep wouldn't be

160
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:51,276
the worst thing in the world.

161
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:52,377
I'm fine.

162
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:53,871
Look, I get it.

163
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:55,272
You're having a hard
time with what happened.

164
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:56,974
It's a lot to take so soon after...

165
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:58,275
I said I'm fine.

166
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:08,185
Hey. Did you hear that?

167
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:09,286
No, what?

168
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:10,954
Caitlin just bit my head off.

169
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,290
She's been all business,
no emotion lately.

170
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,840
She's been... cold.

171
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:18,561
Cold? Come on, Cisco.

172
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:22,904
This could be the beginning
of her becoming evil.

173
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,162
You're not worried about that?

174
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,463
I'm not worried about that.

175
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,732
Caitlin's not gonna become Killer Frost.

176
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,968
Hm. You haven't mentioned anything

177
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,403
about about Earth-2, have you?

178
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,605
No, 'cause I know how to keep a secret.

179
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,007
All right, well, look, I
mean, it's gonna take some time

180
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,175
for her to heal.

181
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:39,944
We just got to be there
for her, keep her busy.

182
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,313
That shouldn't be a problem.

183
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,814
Oh. Hey, Dig, Lyla.

184
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,082
What are you guys doing here?

185
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,252
We came to give you the head's up, Barry.

186
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,353
About what?

187
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,788
A meta-human who escaped
from A.R.G.U.S. custody,

188
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,423
goes by the name King Shark.

189
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,525
King Shark?

190
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,394
You mean the half-man/half-shark
that tried to kill you

191
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,195
months ago. I thought he was dead.

192
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,664
That's what A.R.G.U.S.
wanted you to believe

193
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,499
when they snatched him up, but believe me,

194
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,334
this half-shark is very much alive,

195
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:06,404
and his biological imperative
is telling him to do one thing.

196
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,838
That's kill you, Barry.

197
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,243
We're gonna need a bigger Flash.

198
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,843
So how do you know about King Shark?

199
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,803
Well, as the new Director of A.R.G.U.S.,

200
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:27,539
Lyla's job is to clean
up Amanda Waller's messes.

201
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,608
King Shark was one of the
bigger and weirder ones.

202
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,210
And it appears under her directives,

203
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,212
A.R.G.U.S. had been
monitoring meta-human activity

204
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:34,446
for the past two years.

205
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:34,873
Why?

206
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:37,956
Well, to see if any of those
powers could be exploited.

207
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:39,156
Weaponized.

208
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,160
How do you know that he's coming after me?

209
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,863
While in our custody, he
kept saying the same thing.

210
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:47,897
"Zoom wants The Flash dead"

211
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:50,801
And although he removed
the tracker we had in him,

212
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:52,436
the readings we did
receive show he that was

213
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:53,537
headed towards Central City.

214
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:54,638
Let him come.

215
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,174
Barry, this thing is a killing machine.

216
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:58,442
We just came here to warn you, man.

217
00:10:58,443 --> 00:10:59,543
Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.

218
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:01,245
Nah, I can't do that, Dig.

219
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:03,581
I'm sorry, but all year,
we've been sitting ducks

220
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:05,749
for Zoom and his Earth-2 henchmen.

221
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,250
This is the last one.

222
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:09,386
I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.

223
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:12,554
I'm going after him
first. I owe that to Jay.

224
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,559
Wells, he's from your Earth.
What do you know about him?

225
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,394
Real name, Shay Lamden, he was a...

226
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:20,698
get this... marine biologist
before my particle accelerator

227
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:23,868
changed him into King Shark, and
Zoom put him under his control.

228
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:26,237
So how did you track him
when he attacked Barry?

229
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,672
Zoom sent him to this Earth to kill Barry.

230
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:29,840
I just followed.

231
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:32,276
Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.

232
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,777
Can you find King Shark too?

233
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:34,878
I can try.

234
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,280
All right.

235
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:41,949
Okay, well, all these locations
are next to a body of water.

236
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,721
There must only be a few
hours before he needs to get

237
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:46,123
back into the water to
re-oxygenate his blood.

238
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,559
I can take the waterfront.

239
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,860
Can you have your team handle the rest?

240
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:52,361
- I'll get them on it.
- All right.

241
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,732
What about Dr. Lamden's doppelganger?

242
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,433
Maybe he could help us somehow.

243
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:58,401
Or not. Looks like he died

244
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,938
when the particle accelerator exploded.

245
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,706
What about next of kin?

246
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:04,775
He's got a widow, Doctor Tanya Lamden.

247
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:07,011
She's a research
scientist at Nautilus Labs,

248
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:09,912
and she studies... wait for it... sharks.

249
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:12,917
Maybe the two of you can go
and see if she's discovered

250
00:12:12,918 --> 00:12:14,718
anything in her research
that could help us.

251
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,819
Sure.

252
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:17,154
Great.

253
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:20,991
- Hey, Digg.
- Yeah?

254
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:22,124
How's that helmet treating you?

255
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:23,794
Could use some improvements.

256
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:25,495
I'll get to work on it.

257
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,630
Hey, Joe, what's up?

258
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:28,130
Hey, Bar, I talked to Wally,

259
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:29,365
he wants to meet up with you.

260
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:30,467
All right.

261
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:32,200
He's working on his engineering project

262
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:32,974
at our place tonight.

263
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:35,438
He would love some help
from that big brain of yours.

264
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,696
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry,

265
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:38,130
right now is kind of a crazy time.

266
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,666
What? What's going on?

267
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,400
Remember that meta-human shark

268
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:43,569
that Patty was after and attacked me?

269
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:45,839
He's back? I thought Wells... you know.

270
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,074
Yeah, me too, but
apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him

271
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:51,244
and he escaped, and now he's
heading for Central City.

272
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:52,346
I get it.

273
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,712
I'll tell Wally some other time.

274
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,582
Hey, you know what?

275
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,484
It's all good, I'll make it work.

276
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,718
Tell him tonight should be fine.

277
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:02,055
Are you sure?

278
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:03,823
- Yeah. <i>
- Thanks, Bar.</i>

279
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,025
Yeah, bye.

280
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,762
Why?

281
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,502
It's been two years since your
particle accelerator exploded.

282
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:18,571
Seems a little late to be asking questions

283
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:20,406
about my husband, doesn't it?

284
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:23,644
Your husband passed away
from cancer, correct?

285
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:25,745
I suppose you could say that.

286
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:27,880
It only took three days
for every cell in his body

287
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,514
to grow uncontrollably.

288
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:33,276
Whatever cancer he had, it
turned him into something...

289
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,954
not human.

290
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,857
Well, that's why we're here, actually.

291
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,557
There's a meta-human in Central City

292
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:40,059
whose body seems to be mutating

293
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,561
in the same way as your late husband,

294
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,765
but he didn't die, he
became a dangerous monster.

295
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,634
My husband was no monster.

296
00:13:47,635 --> 00:13:50,037
That's not what she was implying.

297
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,938
What does this have to do with me?

298
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:54,074
We've read about the research
you're doing here on sharks.

299
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:56,242
Mm-hmm, yeah, I've had
some encouraging results,

300
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:58,143
although still preliminary.

301
00:13:58,446 --> 00:13:59,746
We need to see it.

302
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:01,180
I beg your pardon?

303
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,050
Your research, all of it.

304
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,884
What my colleague means to say is that

305
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,587
if you could please let us
take a look at your findings,

306
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:12,622
it could help us stop this
meta-human from hurting anyone.

307
00:14:12,794 --> 00:14:17,094
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs.
I'm just supposed to trust you?

308
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:19,266
Please, Mrs. Lamden.

309
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,700
This could help save lives.

310
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,437
I'll email you what I have.

311
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:27,441
Thank you.

312
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,546
- Little harsh.
- I was being direct.

313
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:37,250
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.

314
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,652
You've been acting differently toward me

315
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:41,220
ever since you got back from Earth-2.

316
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:43,154
What's your problem, Cisco?

317
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:45,258
Nothing.

318
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,259
Let's just go.

319
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:59,005
Grid one, negative.

320
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,876
Grid four, negative.

321
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:10,717
Status check, grid two.

322
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:12,152
<i>Grid two, negative.</i>

323
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:13,253
Anything?

324
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:14,688
No, man, nothing yet.

325
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:16,490
Yeah, so far, nothing on our end either.

326
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:19,592
Let's just hope Wells is
doing better than we are.

327
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:21,426
Hey, how's Felicity doing?

328
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:23,362
Well, I'm not gonna lie,
Barry, it was pretty rough

329
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:26,930
there at first, but you
know Felicity, she's tough.

330
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:30,504
Yeah, she's just not
returning any of my calls.

331
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:32,938
She has a lot going on right now.

332
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,874
Buddy, I'll ask if she can give you a call

333
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,442
when this is all over.

334
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:39,079
Just want to catch this thing, man,

335
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,414
have everything to do with
Zoom and Earth-2 put behind us,

336
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:44,048
so we can just move on with our lives.

337
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:47,019
Starting to do that
thing Oliver does, Barry,

338
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,289
carry the weight of the
world on your shoulders.

339
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,657
Got to stop that, man,
it's gonna slow you down.

340
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:55,128
Still nothing.

341
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:57,329
Status check, Grid six.

342
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,532
<i>Hold on, I think we got something.</i>

343
00:16:13,493 --> 00:16:15,890
So much for cleaning up
after Waller's messes.

344
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,589
We don't find King Shark soon,

345
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,958
someone's gonna be cleaning up after mine.

346
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,592
We'll find him, Lyla.

347
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:24,897
All right, I searched the whole area.

348
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:25,998
He's gone.

349
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:27,299
Couldn't have gotten far.

350
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,001
Still, he knows we're here now.

351
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:31,235
We lost the element of surprise.

352
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,295
Not if Wells can figure
out a way to track him.

353
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:35,789
In the meantime, we'll keep looking.

354
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:37,300
All right, I'll meet
up with you guys later.

355
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:40,161
I got to go see Joe's son.

356
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:43,864
Okay, I thought our
relationship was hard to follow.

357
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:44,965
See ya.

358
00:16:47,535 --> 00:16:50,270
He's fast, John, get over it.

359
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:51,371
Never.

360
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,180
Joe thought I should have you take a look.

361
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:07,020
So, this is what I got so
far for my project essay

362
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:09,654
to get into CCU's engineering program.

363
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:14,560
Turbine supercars?

364
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,164
Turbines? Like jet engines?

365
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,399
Yeah, yeah, it'd use an
engine like the ones they have

366
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,767
in some helicopters, only
it'd run on bio-diesel.

367
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,051
- Cool.
- It's very cool.

368
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,673
Yeah, you're gonna want to address

369
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,308
the fuel economy issue here.

370
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:31,611
It is a jet, so it's gonna
burn through a lot of fuel.

371
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:33,547
Yeah, that's why I want to use bio-diesel.

372
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:35,815
It'll run off of anything
that burns with oxygen.

373
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:37,551
No, okay, but you also got a sound issue.

374
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:38,852
Gonna wake the neighbors...

375
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,153
For sure.

376
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:42,155
Anything else?

377
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,725
Um...

378
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:49,462
Well, I just... want to help, you know.

379
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:50,497
I'm just trying to make
sure they don't have

380
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:51,998
any reason to say no.

381
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,367
Okay.

382
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:57,536
Sorry, Wally, I didn't mean that...

383
00:17:57,572 --> 00:17:59,072
it looks really good.

384
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:03,944
All right, let's start over, okay?

385
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:05,178
Is it...

386
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:09,213
why don't we go through it
all together, work it out?

387
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,750
Sounds good.

388
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:12,118
Cool.

389
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:30,802
This is a complete waste of time.

390
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:33,740
We're not gonna find anything
in Doctor Lamden's research

391
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:36,108
to tell us how to find King Shark.

392
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,944
Maybe I should take a look.

393
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:39,212
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor

394
00:18:39,213 --> 00:18:40,847
with a specialty in bio-chem.

395
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:42,849
I'm just saying maybe you could use

396
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,150
another set of eyes, considering.

397
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:47,320
Considering what?

398
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,756
Considering the way
you've been acting lately.

399
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:51,324
What does that mean?

400
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:53,558
You are not yourself, Caitlin,

401
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:55,762
and it's freaking me out, 'cause you have

402
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:59,596
this icy look in your eye
just like you did over there.

403
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,700
Over there?

404
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:02,702
You mean Earth-2?

405
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:05,683
No. Uh, no.

406
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:09,723
Um, what I meant to say was...

407
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:12,123
You met my doppelganger, didn't you?

408
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:15,126
What? No.

409
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,360
Cisco.

410
00:19:16,995 --> 00:19:18,629
Look, I'm not supposed to say anything.

411
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,208
Why not?

412
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:21,632
Because I'm not supposed to say anything.

413
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:25,461
Francisco Ramon, if you
don't start talking...

414
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:28,519
Okay, fine, yes, I met your doppelganger.

415
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:31,261
She's a coldhearted ice
queen named Killer Frost,

416
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:33,962
a meta-human who enjoyed killing a lot.

417
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:36,896
There, great.

418
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:39,570
Now Harry's gonna kill me and
throw myself across the room.

419
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:43,016
Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.

420
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:45,309
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting

421
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,977
just like she did over there.

422
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:50,145
You're being shut off.
You're being detached.

423
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:51,681
You're being cold.

424
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,283
Because I have to be right now.

425
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:58,385
I just watched Jay get killed
right in front of my eyes,

426
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:02,025
just when I was starting
to feel normal again,

427
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:04,393
just when I was beginning to love.

428
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,798
So if I let myself feel,

429
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:13,006
if I let all of that pain and anger out,

430
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:14,671
it's never gonna stop,

431
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,407
and that's not gonna help me either,

432
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:19,509
so let's just get back to this research

433
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,143
and figure out how to find King Shark.

434
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:23,647
Okay.

435
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:36,827
Here you are.

436
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,197
Yup, just like back home, always working.

437
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,366
I'm trying to locate this King Shark.

438
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,267
He's here? On this Earth?

439
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:46,436
Yes, it turns out our friend Zoom

440
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:48,870
brought him here to kill The Flash.

441
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:52,109
Looks like he's stuck
here just like we are.

442
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,911
It looks like he is, and
so I need to figure this out

443
00:20:54,912 --> 00:20:57,486
before more people get hurt, Jessie, so...

444
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,317
Probability distribution algorithm?

445
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:01,952
Partial matching strategies, yes.

446
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:02,799
Based on what?

447
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:06,151
Semantic trajectories...
water, Central City, The Flash.

448
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:08,769
What about mobility behaviors?

449
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,539
Jessie.

450
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:12,508
Look, you wanted me out of that room,

451
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:15,378
but now that I am, you don't want me here.

452
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:18,348
Just let me help, please.

453
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,917
Grab a marker.

454
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:28,924
Yeah.

455
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,747
Hardest part was amping the torque

456
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:34,081
without increasing drag.

457
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:35,616
A heavier engine would
only slow things down,

458
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:37,418
but this streamlined
version should optimize

459
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:39,852
both the torque and the horsepower.

460
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:43,424
Yeah, I'm just worried
it's... won't be enough still.

461
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:44,725
Here, let's do this...

462
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:46,060
use a one-to-one transfer gearbox

463
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,362
to drop the output shaft of the engine,

464
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:50,465
reverse rotation and send more power

465
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:52,166
to the torque converter.

466
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:57,405
I didn't come for you
to just do it for me.

467
00:21:57,406 --> 00:21:59,307
I thought we were gonna
work on this together.

468
00:21:59,308 --> 00:22:00,708
Yeah, we are, I'm...

469
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:02,610
I'm just trying to speed up the process.

470
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:03,711
Why?

471
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:08,281
What, you got somewhere better to be?

472
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:12,216
No, Wally, I'm... Wally.

473
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:15,489
All right.

474
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,391
Do you have a problem with me?

475
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:21,395
Who could have a problem with you?

476
00:22:21,396 --> 00:22:23,896
You're Barry, right? You're perfect.

477
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:26,066
Never do anything wrong.

478
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:28,535
Always this, always that.

479
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:31,405
Wally.

480
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,074
I mean, take a look around you, man.

481
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:35,642
You're in every picture in this room.

482
00:22:35,944 --> 00:22:38,045
You know, thanks for your help,

483
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:40,746
but I'll just take care of this myself.

484
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:50,924
Where's The Flash?

485
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,735
I know The Flash is here.

486
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:08,220
I can smell him.

487
00:23:08,313 --> 00:23:09,746
Everybody get out!

488
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:12,515
Come on. All right, come on.

489
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,353
Where is he?

490
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:22,096
Right here!

491
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,403
Flash, Zoom wants you dead!

492
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:33,833
Yeah, I know.

493
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,038
Then you get to go home, right?

494
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,976
Well, guess what, man.

495
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,175
The breaches that Zoom
used to bring you here,

496
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,043
they're all gone. I closed 'em, for good!

497
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:47,705
There's no more Zoom.

498
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:50,774
There's no way back to your Earth.

499
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:55,480
You're gonna be locked up
here for a very long time.

500
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:01,552
No!

501
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:18,645
You might be fast, but not
as fast as I am in water!

502
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:21,579
You're not gonna catch me, Flash!

503
00:24:30,216 --> 00:24:31,316
Okay.

504
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:33,551
You okay?

505
00:24:33,652 --> 00:24:35,152
Oh, yeah, I'm good.

506
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:39,089
Think he broke a few things, but I'm good.

507
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:53,469
I don't suppose my homeowner's insurance

508
00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:55,539
covers a "Sharknado" attack.

509
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,124
I don't understand you people.

510
00:24:58,156 --> 00:25:00,691
Jaws busts through your
house like the Kool-Aid Man,

511
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:03,751
The Flash shows up, and y'all
just act like it's no big deal.

512
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:06,440
Yeah, well, we've had a
lot of weird things happen

513
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:08,498
in Central City over the past two years.

514
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:11,365
Weirder than a talking
shark wearing pants?

515
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:13,199
Man, you'd be surprised.

516
00:25:14,336 --> 00:25:15,369
Hey.

517
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,305
Hey, you guys. Everybody okay?

518
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,207
Yeah, yeah, we're fine.

519
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,376
What'd you go hide under your bed?

520
00:25:22,377 --> 00:25:23,610
Wally, come on.

521
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:26,380
You know, Joe and Iris
told me a lot about you,

522
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:28,549
made it out like you could
walk on water, or something,

523
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,184
but they never mentioned anything

524
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:31,819
about you being a coward.

525
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,920
Okay, enough!

526
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,060
See you guys later.

527
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,067
Dad, you need to talk to him.

528
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:50,669
No. It's fine, I get it.

529
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:54,390
Look, I know you guys love me,

530
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:57,159
but please stop telling Wally
all this great stuff about me.

531
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,327
Start telling him the
truth. I'm not perfect.

532
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:02,178
I make mistakes that
even The Flash can't fix.

533
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:03,303
Okay.

534
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:06,768
What happened with you on Earth-2?

535
00:26:07,237 --> 00:26:08,337
The truth.

536
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:13,930
I shouldn't... tell you guys this, but...

537
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,924
I met your doppelgangers.

538
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:21,231
You were the cop in the
family, a good one too.

539
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:24,027
I told you I would've made a good cop.

540
00:26:24,052 --> 00:26:25,619
Don't get any ideas.

541
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,893
What about me then?

542
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:29,794
You were a lounge singer.

543
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,563
Yeah, you had this
amazing voice, actually,

544
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,734
but you didn't like me at all.

545
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,838
You actually blamed me
for Iris becoming a cop,

546
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,872
said that she only became one

547
00:26:41,108 --> 00:26:44,176
to help her selfish husband's career.

548
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:46,412
Wait.

549
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,648
We were married?

550
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,016
Mm-hmm.

551
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,185
And we went to go see Joe perform.

552
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,423
And that's when everything went wrong.

553
00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:05,355
Um, some metas that
worked for Zoom showed up,

554
00:27:05,356 --> 00:27:06,302
they were looking for me.

555
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:08,570
They knew I wasn't supposed to be there,

556
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:10,682
and they attacked,

557
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:14,910
and you got caught in the crossfire,

558
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:17,615
and... you died.

559
00:27:20,287 --> 00:27:25,657
I knew that it wasn't you,
that none of that was this life,

560
00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:26,682
but...

561
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:32,928
I mean, watching it happen
in front of me, living that,

562
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:37,749
it didn't feel any different,
because it was all still real.

563
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:42,137
And Jay warned me not to
get emotionally sucked in

564
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:43,438
when I went there,

565
00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:47,607
and then that's exactly what happened.

566
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:53,079
And now Joe West on Earth-2
is dead, because I showed up.

567
00:27:56,986 --> 00:27:59,765
Barry, that... that's not your fault.

568
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,823
Yeah, it is my fault.

569
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,960
It's all my fault.

570
00:28:05,528 --> 00:28:06,628
Zoom,

571
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:09,223
this King Shark,

572
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,020
Jay's death,

573
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:14,702
it's all because of me.

574
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:19,432
And then I just left an entire world

575
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:20,676
at Zoom's mercy.

576
00:28:37,392 --> 00:28:40,218
Just when you thought it was
safe to go back in the suburbs,

577
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,350
King Shark shows up at your house.

578
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,084
I mean, I don't even know how he found me.

579
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:45,985
It's not like I was The
Flash while I was at home.

580
00:28:45,986 --> 00:28:47,953
- Must be a reason.
- Yeah.

581
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:50,223
Have you figured out a way
to track King Shark yet?

582
00:28:50,224 --> 00:28:51,758
No, I don't have enough information

583
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,827
to create an accurate location algorithm.

584
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:54,994
What about Dr. Lamden's research?

585
00:28:54,995 --> 00:28:56,262
Anything that can help us?

586
00:28:56,263 --> 00:28:57,169
I didn't think so at first,

587
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,403
but then I found something
that I think might help us.

588
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:01,413
Sharks are predators.

589
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:02,972
In order to track their prey, they use

590
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:05,007
what's known as passive electrolocation.

591
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:06,709
Passive electrolocation?

592
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,711
Yes, it's how they sense
the bioelectric potential

593
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:10,212
around a fish's body.

594
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:12,715
King Shark senses
electricity in Barry's system.

595
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:15,518
Okay, that explains how
King Shark can track Barry,

596
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,253
but how is that going
to help us track him?

597
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:18,721
We flip it. Instead of King Shark

598
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:20,423
being the predator, we make him the prey,

599
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:23,025
and track him using
active electrolocation.

600
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:25,161
We reprogram our satellite to generate

601
00:29:25,162 --> 00:29:27,063
a specific electric field and then measure

602
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:28,731
any electrical distortions that correlate

603
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:30,632
with a 1-ton walking shark.

604
00:29:30,634 --> 00:29:33,201
That'll help us get him.

605
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,737
You help me out?

606
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:36,539
Sure.

607
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:39,835
Great.

608
00:29:40,031 --> 00:29:42,038
Let us know when you locate him
and we'll take it from there.

609
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,213
Okay.

610
00:29:43,437 --> 00:29:45,337
Let's get the team ready.

611
00:29:57,651 --> 00:29:59,751
What exactly is that?

612
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:02,921
That, my friend, is bait.

613
00:30:03,257 --> 00:30:04,691
You made a Flash lure?

614
00:30:04,692 --> 00:30:06,259
It's the best I could come up with

615
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,627
given the time frame.

616
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:09,162
It's rigged to mimic and enhance

617
00:30:09,163 --> 00:30:10,864
the electric field Barry's body generates.

618
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:12,298
King Shark takes one whiff of that,

619
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:13,533
<i>cue the "Jaws" soundtrack.</i>

620
00:30:13,534 --> 00:30:15,068
Also stuffed it with enough tranqs

621
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:16,369
to knock him out for a month.

622
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,571
Should make him a lot easier to reel in.

623
00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:20,072
And that container.

624
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:22,308
Strong enough to hold
him once he's sedated?

625
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:24,978
It's made of promethium
metal. It's impenetrable.

626
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:26,679
Meanwhile, we'll be able
to keep track of King Shark

627
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,449
with this, and the cameras
that are on the lure.

628
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,484
Whatever he does, we'll have eyes on him.

629
00:30:31,485 --> 00:30:33,985
All right, then. Let's go fishing.

630
00:30:35,823 --> 00:30:37,423
Caitlin, I don't understand why

631
00:30:37,424 --> 00:30:39,993
I can't be the one playing
Quint in this scenario.

632
00:30:39,994 --> 00:30:42,694
I should be the one out there, not you.

633
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:44,129
I need to do this.

634
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:46,565
You know Quint dies, right?

635
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:54,574
Water is this monster's natural habitat.

636
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:56,142
He's gonna be a lot stronger here.

637
00:30:56,143 --> 00:30:57,576
You sure about this?

638
00:30:58,212 --> 00:30:59,645
This ends tonight.

639
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:08,188
Maybe he's not gonna fall for this

640
00:31:08,189 --> 00:31:10,089
He's a shark. He'll come.

641
00:31:11,725 --> 00:31:12,892
Anything, Cisco?

642
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:17,497
Uh, nope, nothing that
looks like it could be him.

643
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:19,265
You programmed the
satellite though, right?

644
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:19,855
Yes, Harry.

645
00:31:19,955 --> 00:31:21,189
I mean, you punched in
the correct parameters?

646
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,557
You're insulting my intelligence.

647
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:23,925
But they've been waiting for hours.

648
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:25,293
Did you punch in the correct parameters?

649
00:31:25,294 --> 00:31:26,895
I know they've been out there for hours,

650
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:28,096
but you're insulting my
intelligence with this, okay?

651
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:29,397
- I know.
- Okay.

652
00:31:29,532 --> 00:31:30,732
Hey, you set the right
distortion scope, right?

653
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:32,817
Oh, for real? Okay.

654
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:34,484
You know what, we're
gonna play a game here.

655
00:31:34,485 --> 00:31:35,819
It's called, if you're from Earth-2,

656
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,787
you're gonna be quiet, okay?

657
00:31:38,123 --> 00:31:39,156
Yeah.

658
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:48,065
Hey, Barry, are you okay?

659
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:52,736
Ever since Zoom beat
me here and on Earth-2,

660
00:31:52,737 --> 00:31:55,170
I've been running away from things,

661
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,240
instead of towards them.

662
00:31:57,809 --> 00:31:59,309
That needs to change.

663
00:31:59,745 --> 00:32:01,645
We'll get you back there.

664
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:03,481
I know.

665
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:05,949
Think of this as your first step.

666
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,050
Or swim.

667
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:15,628
Uh, hey, guys. What is that?

668
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:21,742
The big kahuna. Guys, incoming.

669
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,934
<i>He's headed for the bait!</i>

670
00:32:38,017 --> 00:32:39,117
Whoa.

671
00:32:39,785 --> 00:32:41,085
He ate the lure!

672
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,087
Reel him in, all right?

673
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:45,622
Come on.

674
00:32:56,635 --> 00:32:57,802
Where'd he go?

675
00:32:58,337 --> 00:33:00,304
He's headed for the docks.

676
00:33:01,473 --> 00:33:02,573
Go, go, go.

677
00:33:02,808 --> 00:33:04,241
Get ready to fire!

678
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:22,735
Those guns won't stop me, Flash.

679
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:25,966
First I'll kill you, then I'll kill them.

680
00:33:26,732 --> 00:33:28,899
Oh, yeah? Let's do this then!

681
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,400
Come on!

682
00:33:57,196 --> 00:33:58,496
What is he doing?

683
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:00,430
He's electrifying the water.

684
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,710
Ohh.

685
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:50,012
Now we can reel him in.

686
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:05,882
Hell of a catch, Barry.

687
00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:06,983
Yeah.

688
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:10,319
Let's just make sure he doesn't
become "the one that got away."

689
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,788
Won't let that happen again.

690
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:13,489
What are you gonna do with him?

691
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,025
I don't know yet. But
one thing's for sure,

692
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:18,561
A.R.G.U.S.'s plans to turn
King Shark into a weapon

693
00:35:18,562 --> 00:35:20,262
died with Amanda Waller.

694
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:22,723
I think our time would be better served

695
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:25,893
learning about how he came
to be and how to cure him.

696
00:35:25,894 --> 00:35:28,295
You know, you should
really talk to Dr. Lamden.

697
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:29,930
She's done a lot of research,

698
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:31,765
and I think it could be helpful to you.

699
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:34,399
I'll do that. Nice to see you again.

700
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,970
Mm-hmm.

701
00:35:39,508 --> 00:35:41,557
Well, thanks a lot, Dig.

702
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:43,711
Hey, I got to thank you, Barry.

703
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:47,879
Got Lyla get her first win, I
got to watch you run on water.

704
00:35:48,483 --> 00:35:49,650
It was biblical.

705
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:55,689
Look, Barry, when I was in Afghanistan,

706
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,190
I lost a lot of friends... brothers.

707
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:02,394
So losing Jay, I know what it feels like.

708
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:06,098
Question yourself. Blame
yourself for his death.

709
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:11,852
And that guilt, it can tear
you apart, but trust me, man,

710
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:14,040
you got to get control of it,

711
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,709
or it'll rip you up inside.

712
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,613
Use this, man, let it guide you,

713
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:22,882
so it never happens again.

714
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:25,019
- All right, thanks, man.
- You got it.

715
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,520
Say hi to everyone for me, all right?

716
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:28,021
I will.

717
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:38,431
Yeah, okay. That's kind of freaky.

718
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:40,601
Yeah, yeah, see? I told you.

719
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:42,235
Hey, Oliver, what's up?

720
00:36:47,876 --> 00:36:49,976
You're a really slow reader.

721
00:36:54,149 --> 00:36:55,249
So?

722
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:58,352
I want one of these super cars.

723
00:36:58,353 --> 00:36:59,720
I mean, especially if I can run it

724
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:02,289
off the bacon grease I collect? I mean...

725
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,323
Man, Wally. I'm so impressed.

726
00:37:06,094 --> 00:37:07,194
Thanks.

727
00:37:07,462 --> 00:37:10,095
But Barry gave me a lot of help, so...

728
00:37:10,283 --> 00:37:13,052
Yeah, he did, but this was all your idea,

729
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:15,169
this is your hard work. It's all you.

730
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,070
Barry'd say the same thing.

731
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:18,906
Would he?

732
00:37:21,977 --> 00:37:23,077
Look, Wally.

733
00:37:26,514 --> 00:37:30,001
Iris and I took Barry in when he was 11,

734
00:37:30,418 --> 00:37:31,752
and the reason he came to live with us

735
00:37:31,753 --> 00:37:34,758
is because his mother was murdered,

736
00:37:34,923 --> 00:37:38,290
and his father was
wrongfully imprisoned for it.

737
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:43,597
And I have been overprotective
of that kid since that day.

738
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:48,490
We gave him all the love
and support he needed

739
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:50,391
to get through that tragedy

740
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:53,227
and become the man he is now.

741
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:56,521
So that... that pride

742
00:37:57,767 --> 00:38:00,035
you see when Iris and
I are talking about him,

743
00:38:00,036 --> 00:38:01,136
is because...

744
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:05,253
things could have gone very differently.

745
00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:08,319
But he's not perfect,

746
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:12,678
and he's not favored over
you or Iris or anybody else.

747
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,383
So you have nothing to worry about.

748
00:38:17,787 --> 00:38:18,887
He's my son...

749
00:38:20,723 --> 00:38:22,023
just like you are.

750
00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:28,230
What are you doing with those?

751
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,865
I'm adjusting the wavelength trigger,

752
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:31,900
see if I can get these to work over here.

753
00:38:31,901 --> 00:38:34,002
So you can catch some breachers?

754
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:35,570
Dear God!

755
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:37,871
Caitlin, your hands are freezing.

756
00:38:37,874 --> 00:38:40,574
Caitlin. I've always hated that name.

757
00:38:41,878 --> 00:38:42,978
Oh, no.

758
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:46,748
No, no, no, it's starting.
You're starting to become...

759
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:47,849
Killer Frost?

760
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,422
That ain't right.

761
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:55,891
That ain't right, that's just rude.

762
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:57,158
Who put you up to this?

763
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,393
Barry put you up to this, didn't he?

764
00:38:58,394 --> 00:39:00,829
Oh, I should've know you two were...

765
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:01,997
- Cold?
- Yeah.

766
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:04,065
You deserve it for thinking

767
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:06,433
that I could ever become like her.

768
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,771
Cisco, you need to stop worrying about me.

769
00:39:09,772 --> 00:39:12,774
I may be sad, I may want to
be alone for a little while,

770
00:39:12,775 --> 00:39:16,142
but I promise you, Killer
Frost will never exist

771
00:39:16,412 --> 00:39:17,845
on this earth, okay?

772
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:19,247
Besides, you tested me.

773
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:21,881
I don't even have the meta-human gene,

774
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:24,584
so please stop worrying about me, okay?

775
00:39:26,222 --> 00:39:27,188
Okay.

776
00:39:28,457 --> 00:39:30,890
Come on, Barry wants us upstairs.

777
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,496
For real, though, you got
to work on that circulation.

778
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,231
You might have Raynaud's or something.

779
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:39,865
- You know what Raynaud's is?
- I'm a doctor, Cisco.

780
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:43,875
Hail, hail, the gang's
all here. What's good?

781
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:45,054
Uh...

782
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,751
I need to apologize to you all.

783
00:39:52,144 --> 00:39:53,244
Um...

784
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:56,652
Last year I made a choice

785
00:39:56,653 --> 00:40:00,421
to go back in time and save my mother,

786
00:40:02,398 --> 00:40:06,238
and that choice had a lot of consequences

787
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,317
that will haunt me for
the rest of my life,

788
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,290
just like I know it haunts all of you too.

789
00:40:15,173 --> 00:40:19,338
Zoom, Jay's death...

790
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,513
It's all because of me,

791
00:40:24,282 --> 00:40:27,367
but I own those choices.

792
00:40:27,786 --> 00:40:30,154
We're the ones who opened
the door to Earth-2.

793
00:40:30,155 --> 00:40:32,423
We're the ones who brought Zoom here,

794
00:40:32,424 --> 00:40:35,791
but we are also the ones
who are gonna stop him.

795
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:37,495
How?

796
00:40:39,297 --> 00:40:41,664
How are we gonna stop Zoom, Allen?

797
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:44,168
I don't know yet.

798
00:40:48,006 --> 00:40:50,775
But those breaches aren't closed forever,

799
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:53,009
and we're not done with Earth-2.

800
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:03,186
Jay's death was not in vain.

801
00:41:05,323 --> 00:41:07,445
We will meet Zoom again,

802
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:11,240
and the next time, I will beat him,

803
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:14,764
whoever that monster is.

804
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:53,402
Well, this is a complication.
