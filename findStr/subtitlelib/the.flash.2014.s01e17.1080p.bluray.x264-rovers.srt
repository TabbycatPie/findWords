1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,563
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,765
When I was a child, I saw my mother
killed by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,406
My father went to
prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,646
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,725
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,522
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,169
And one day, I'll find who killed my
mother and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,203
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,649
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,325
You're him, the Reverse-Flash.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,363
I am Eobard Thawne...

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,886
and the Flash's speed...

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,731
is the key to my
returning to my time.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,451
I've been teamed up with
Mason Bridge, who is a legend.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,285
You're the guy who thinks
Wells is a mad genius.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,130
What do you know about him?

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,721
I think that maybe you
were right about Dr. Wells.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,922
- Which part?
- All of it.

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,443
Come on.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,965
Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,925
'MOTH! Morn! Barry!

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,805
- Stay back!
- Mom!

23
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,366
This is everything that we know
about Harrison Wells...

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,329
which is actually not a lot.

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,124
Didn't you read
a book about him?

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,762
Six hundred pages and the big
takeaway is he's enigmatic.

27
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,766
Your mom was killed
by a Speedster.

28
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,962
Wells' machine turned you
into a speedster.

29
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,522
That's way too many coincidences
for this old cop.

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,846
Do you think that he wanted me
to become the Flash?

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,444
Everything he's done...

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,610
since that night
you got struck by lightning:

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,201
bringing you to S.T.A.R. Labs,
giving you the suit...

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,570
training you.
It's all been to keep you safe.

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,960
And to make me faster.

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,131
Wells once said that he needed
more speed from me.

37
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,520
Why?

38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,403
I don't know.

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,124
He wants something
from you, Barry.

40
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,169
We just need to
figure out what it is.

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,362
Let's go get him,
let's get some answers.

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,881
We can't do that now
as much as we might want to.

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,482
Joe, you had your suspicions about
Wells from the very beginning.

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,842
You thought that he might be
the man in yellow.

45
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,481
Except the blood from your house
didn't match him.

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,206
All right, so maybe he's not
the Reverse-Flash.

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,970
You think he knows
what happened.

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,561
He may have the key
to getting my dad out of prison.

49
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,162
Whatever Wells wants from you...

50
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,204
it started 15 years ago.

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,002
He's been patient.

52
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,611
Scary patient.

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,403
You gotta listen to me on this.

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,011
We have to be...

55
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,885
just as patient.

56
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,605
Yeah.

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,171
Oh, wow.

58
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,126
Wow. Look.

59
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,120
Wow.

60
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,320
Henry?

61
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,766
Henry!

62
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,967
Henry!

63
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
Henry!

64
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,450
Henry.

65
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,165
Nice name.

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,085
Tricked you. Ha, ha.

67
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,447
Look who's back.

68
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,846
My tricks.

69
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,570
My treat.

70
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,764
But I'll give you
something good...

71
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,849
to eat.

72
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,851
Today's special:

73
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,566
A city in ashes.

74
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,445
The Trickster proudly
welcomes you all...

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,449
to the new...

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,365
disorder.

77
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,086
Talking in the third person.
That's never a good sign.

78
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,045
- You're mad because he named himself.
- Actually, he didn't.

79
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,886
Twenty years ago, Central City was
hit by a series of terrorist attacks.

80
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,044
One man killed at least
10 civilians, two cops.

81
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,202
That guy called
himself the Trickster.

82
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,007
Whoa. Someone was
rocking the unitard.

83
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,210
James Jesse?

84
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,283
Like Jesse James,
only more twisted.

85
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,329
Where is this Mr. Jesse now?

86
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,127
He's serving several life
sentences at Iron Heights.

87
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,250
He was the most dangerous thing
Central City had ever seen.

88
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,290
You mean until the particle
accelerator blew up.

89
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,204
- Um...
- Barry and I...

90
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,721
will go see this James Jesse
at Iron Heights.

91
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,963
See if he can give us something
that can help us catch his groupie.

92
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,010
I'll analyze the video and see
if I can figure out the source.

93
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,040
Hey, Joe.

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,720
Barry doing all right?

95
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,080
He seems cranky.

96
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,003
Even the Flash wakes up on the
wrong side of the bed some mornings.

97
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,009
He's fine.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,604
Mom!

99
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,122
Nora, hold on!

100
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,169
Run, Barry. Run!

101
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,648
Gideon, what's happening to me?

102
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,441
Your latest time jump against the Flash
caused a massive drain on your powers.

103
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,642
Your cells contain no trace
of the Speed Force.

104
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,610
- That's impossible.
- Your ability to move at super-speed...

105
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,804
as well as travel in time
has been completely depleted.

106
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,486
How am I supposed to get back?

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,484
You can't.

108
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,521
I've never seen this part
of the prison before.

109
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,805
I had to have this cell specially built
for James Jesse about five years ago.

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,287
- Why's that?
- A criminal psychologist set up...

111
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,766
weekly visits with him.

112
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,411
James talked the shrink
into committing suicide.

113
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,769
Oh. You're gonna need these.

114
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,605
Okay.

115
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,004
Gentlemen.

116
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,283
Please, be seated.

117
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,251
I'm Detective Joe West.
This is Barry Allen.

118
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,451
Uh, we'd like to ask
you a few questions.

119
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,041
Mm...

120
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,204
I can smell them in your pocket.

121
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,605
Yesterday, hundreds
of these parachute bombs...

122
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,770
were released
throughout Central City.

123
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,362
Huh.Funidea.

124
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,207
But not an effective
delivery system.

125
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,760
How many died?

126
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,000
No one. Luckily.

127
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,488
You know, when I was free
and at my height...

128
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,365
a day without
casualties was like...

129
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,723
Well, like the Cubs
winning the pennant.

130
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,649
It just never happened.

131
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,082
The explosives I found
in the parachute bombs...

132
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,489
had the same explosive composition
as the bombs you set off...

133
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,650
20 years ago.
That's impossible.

134
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,444
I never told anyone
that formula.

135
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,483
The signatures are
an exact match.

136
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,889
He called himself the
Trickster too, just like you.

137
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,245
He is nothing like me,
detective. Nothing.

138
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,326
Do you know...

139
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,409
who he is?

140
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,890
Oh...

141
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,048
If I did...

142
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,685
I would tell you.

143
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,086
So you could find him...

144
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,204
cut off his head,
and throw it right in his face.

145
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,250
No, this is
obviously the work...

146
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,881
of a rank amateur at best.

147
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,086
A mere pretender
angling for my throne.

148
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,726
I hear you.

149
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,604
So...

150
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,164
Help us catch him.

151
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,203
Prove there's only
one Trickster.

152
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,527
Trying to trick the
Trickster, Joseph, hmm?

153
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,926
No.

154
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,841
There's only one way...

155
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,486
this could happen.

156
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,649
Whoever he is...

157
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,208
he must have found my lair.

158
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,691
I ask only one thing.

159
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,609
When you find this...

160
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,928
shtick stealer,
this gimmick grabber...

161
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,203
this pathetic,
wannabe fake...

162
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,330
make sure...

163
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,522
your safety's off.

164
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,169
Something's happened
to Mason Bridge.

165
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,890
No one has seen
or heard from him.

166
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,242
He's a journalist, Iris.
Maybe he's on a story.

167
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,966
Then why hasn't he answered
his phone or his e-mails?

168
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,691
Maybe he stumbled on the
wrong story and is laying low.

169
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,211
You don't know him like I do.

170
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,006
When Mason's on a story,
nothing is getting in his way.

171
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,441
I mean, he considers threats
minor annoyances.

172
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,247
Maybe he's on a bender, or he met a
girl worth disappearing for a week over.

173
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,086
He said something weird
was going on at S.T.A.R. Labs.

174
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,441
Eddie, something has happened to
him. Something bad, I can feel it.

175
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,840
Please.

176
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,083
Captain Singh has everyone on
the Central City park bomber...

177
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,250
but as soon as I can, I'll
look into Bridge. I promise.

178
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,290
Okay.

179
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,360
This looks like nobody has
been here since the '90s.

180
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,801
Yeah, look at this thing.

181
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,851
You think Jesse doesn't know
who this new Trickster guy is?

182
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,451
He seemed pretty ticked off...

183
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,729
that someone was besmirching
his bad name.

184
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,570
Joe.

185
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,323
Let's see what he's
got stashed in there.

186
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,720
Yeah.

187
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,846
- Damn.
- You good?

188
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,009
The copycat.

189
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,202
He took everything.

190
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,886
- Hey, can we have a second?
- Yeah, sure.

191
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,280
Dad.

192
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,560
_H€Y- Barf)'-

193
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,040
H9)'-

194
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,606
What are you doing here?

195
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,168
Uh, Joe and I have some questions
for an inmate about a bombing case.

196
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,410
Dad, listen.

197
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,800
I'm close.

198
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,082
The man who put you in here,
I'm getting close.

199
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,442
- Closer than I've ever been.
- Barry.

200
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,927
- We have talked about this.
- I know.

201
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,485
And I'm done talking.

202
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,281
You're not gonna pay
for another man's crime anymore.

203
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,324
Just hang in there, okay?

204
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,520
Joe.

205
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,366
- What's he talking about? - Like
he said, Henry, just hang in there.

206
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,882
What, no candy, fellas?

207
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,845
That storage space you sent
us to was booby-trapped.

208
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,407
You can never be too careful
with your private things.

209
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,965
You were protecting nothing.

210
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,446
Your secret stash was empty.

211
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,840
What do you mean?

212
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,605
No firearms, none of
your explosives, nothing.

213
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,128
Whatever you had in there,
it was stolen. All of it.

214
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,845
No.

215
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,441
He's stealing my legacy.

216
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,166
Whoever this is...

217
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,330
you need to find him.
I will not let this, this...

218
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,166
- Trickster?
- That is my name, mine.

219
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,600
What was in that room?

220
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,926
What were you keeping there?

221
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,565
A bomb.

222
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,967
A really big bomb.

223
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,123
HOW big?

224
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,284
Bye-bye, Central City.

225
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,000
- Cisco?
- Yo.

226
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,886
This Trickster guy just posted a vlog, you
gotta see this. I'm sending you the link.

227
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,445
Okay.

228
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,403
Denizens of Central City.

229
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,286
Or those of you who remain.

230
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,451
Welcome to Boom Day, ha-ha-ha.

231
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,207
I'm very proud to report that my
first trick was an exploding success.

232
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,643
- Show him.
- But I think you all deserve...

233
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,161
something much, uh...

234
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,129
bigger. No, no, no.

235
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,725
So for my next trick...

236
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,564
Take off my mask, you fraud.

237
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,688
Keep your eyes
glued to this website.

238
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,002
Pretender. Sham.

239
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,527
What The Trickster
has planned for you all...

240
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,451
- Take off my mask.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

241
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,449
Take off my mask!

242
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,924
This was posted a few hours ago.

243
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,645
Whoever this Trickster is...

244
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,040
he's certainly not shy.

245
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,607
Not every criminal likes
to hide in the dark.

246
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,091
Cisco, can you trace
where the video was posted from?

247
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,480
I tried.

248
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,484
But this guy is using some crazy,
Felicity-caliber scrambler...

249
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,840
like I've never seen.

250
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,725
The origin of the uploads coming
from hundreds of locations.

251
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,326
Until he uploads another video,
it's gonna be tough.

252
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,562
He has the capability
to destroy the city.

253
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,411
Hey, I said tough,
not impossible.

254
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,762
Barry, we'll catch
him. We always do.

255
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,411
Mr. Allen.

256
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,004
A word, please.

257
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,848
I know what's going on with you.

258
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,648
I know what you're thinking.

259
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,964
Do you?

260
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,964
I know going to Iron Heights
and conversing with Mr. Jesse...

261
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,522
has brought about feelings of
your father. How could it not?

262
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,802
Yeah, no, it's, uh...

263
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,525
It's been...

264
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,240
really tough knowing
that my mom's killer...

265
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,169
is still out there.

266
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,049
Of course.

267
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,045
But We'll find him.

268
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,242
Together. You have my word.

269
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,160
Thank you.

270
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,640
But for now...

271
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,970
how about we focus on finding this
Trickster before anybody else gets hurt?

272
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,245
I have to go.

273
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,007
But thanks for the pep talk.

274
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,565
I'm always here for you.

275
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,004
A team of research laboratories
unconnected to the government...

276
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,329
unconnected to any business
interests, or any of that stuff.

277
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,887
We build right downtown
in the heart of the city...

278
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,082
in the epicenter,
and we become...

279
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,085
the heart of the city. We
become the heart of the nation.

280
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,210
We change what you think
about the sciences and then...

281
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,880
What?

282
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,207
Just that my father
would've loved you...

283
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,801
as much as I do.

284
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,011
Well, I Wish...

285
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,407
I could've met him.

286
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,764
Oh.

287
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,604
- What would you call these
laboratories? - Well, we, Tess Morgan...

288
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,730
would call them
the Technological Engineering...

289
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,160
Scientific Studies...

290
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,806
or T.E.S.S. for short.

291
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,962
Well, that is very...

292
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,205
very sweet, but how about:

293
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,967
Scientific and Technological...

294
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,771
Advanced Research
Laboratories...

295
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,089
or...

296
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,850
S.T.A.R. Labs for short?

297
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,800
Because...

298
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,444
in the vast night sky...

299
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,051
you, Harrison Wells...

300
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,647
are the only star I see.

301
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,171
That's gonna get you kissed.

302
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,722
You're a full-time reporter now.

303
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,325
Why are we meeting here?

304
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,204
I still have a key.

305
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,720
And this is...

306
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,888
kind of our place, right?

307
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,640
What's up?

308
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,522
My co-worker, Mason
Bridge, is missing.

309
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,206
He's not at home,
he's not answering his phone.

310
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,811
I mean, it's not like him.

311
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,810
I'm really worried
that something bad has happened.

312
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,644
I'm sure he's fine.

313
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,730
That's what Eddie says,
that's what everyone is saying.

314
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,522
Please, will you look into it?

315
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,131
For me?

316
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,400
For you.

317
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,731
Thanks.

318
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,208
Um...

319
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,926
Are you okay?

320
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,729
You seem like you have...

321
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,331
a heavy heart.

322
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,084
Sometimes I'm not sure
why I wear a mask with you.

323
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,482
Well, maybe one day
you'll take it off.

324
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,290
Heads up, Trickstefls
broadcasting again.

325
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,205
Can I borrow your laptop?

326
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,010
Um...

327
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,610
Sure, help...

328
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,770
Help yourself.

329
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,689
Get ready for the
games to begin!

330
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,928
I have...

331
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,525
a bomb.

332
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,160
It's a big bomb.

333
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,283
It will make a big bang...

334
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,091
and then a big hole,
and then a big drop...

335
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,840
in the population.

336
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,284
But never say...

337
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,249
the Trickster...

338
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,640
is not fair.

339
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,364
The bomb is somewhere...

340
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,483
between 52nd Street...

341
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,886
and Avenue B.

342
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,081
I want all units, every uniform, every
detective searching that area now.

343
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,729
Somehow, we need
to alert the Flash.

344
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,207
Something tells me
he already knows.

345
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,050
Guys, I can't find it.

346
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,608
- I need your help. - There's
nothing on traffic cams or CCTV.

347
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,327
I retasked S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite to
scan the area for incendiary devices.

348
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,131
Bomb that large should be
giving off a thermal signature.

349
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,651
Then why can't you find it?

350
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,166
Because it's a trick.

351
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,560
The bomb's not there.

352
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,484
It has to be. I'm
gonna keep looking.

353
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,167
That is what he wants, you and the
police to keep running around in circles.

354
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,404
There is something else going
on. I can feel it. Trust me.

355
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,808
I'm gonna keep looking.

356
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,408
- Barry.
- Why doesn't he just listen to you?

357
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,243
I found it.

358
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,165
Uh-oh. There's an
explosion at Iron Heights.

359
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,523
- This was all a diversion.
- The prison was the real target.

360
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,645
James Jesse.

361
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,609
I guess he's tricked us all.

362
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,804
Joe. There's no
bomb in the city.

363
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,129
It was a diversion so the Trickster
could help James Jesse escape.

364
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,086
I know, we just got surveillance
footage from Iron Heights.

365
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,850
Jesse got away.

366
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,566
Barry, look, they
took a hostage.

367
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,400
Well, who'd he take?

368
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,249
A guard? The warden?

369
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,642
No, your dad.

370
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,490
You have to admit.

371
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,571
That was one hell of a trick.

372
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,126
I cannot believe
we're finally in the same room.

373
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,565
I mean, you're my hero.

374
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,649
You need a better
role model, kid.

375
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,889
Can't you see? He's
just using you.

376
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,565
Why did we bring him along?

377
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,330
Huh?

378
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,727
Because his son works
for the C.C.P.D.

379
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,366
Should we find
ourselves in a jam...

380
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,450
a cop's dad makes
an excellent bargaining chip.

381
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,160
Right.

382
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,807
I wouldn't worry too much about
what the cops might do to you.

383
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,601
- Really? - If the police aren't
able to find you, trust me...

384
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,404
the Flash will.

385
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,040
Here's hoping.

386
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,691
So, what's next?

387
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,804
In your last letter, you said
you had something big in mind.

388
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,930
I've had 20 years to come up
with the perfect trick.

389
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,130
It's going to be...

390
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,770
my masterpiece.

391
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,327
My Mona Lisa...

392
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,801
my Breaking Bad season five.

393
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,328
They gave me cable in prison
so I'd stop killing the guards.

394
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,323
Right.

395
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,487
There's just one thing
I've been dying to ask.

396
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,409
Why did you choose me?

397
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,009
Because...

398
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,488
I knew you had the strength
to fulfill my legacy.

399
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,287
Besides...

400
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,488
it was in your blood.

401
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,691
What do you mean, in my blood?

402
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,002
The real reason I
tracked you down...

403
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,725
and groomed you to be...

404
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,764
the best you could
possibly be, Axel:

405
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,444
I...

406
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,961
am your father.

407
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,483
Really?

408
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,366
We were able to identify
the other Trickster.

409
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,489
His name's Axel Walker, age 25.

410
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,361
Him and James have been corresponding
through snail mail for over a decade.

411
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,363
I should've been there.

412
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,801
- We're gonna find your dad, okay?
- Definitely.

413
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,721
I guess I should've
listened to you.

414
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,401
- Sorry, I am so tired.
- Hmm.

415
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,281
I think I'm just gonna put on my pajamas,
go straight to bed when we get home.

416
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,403
- Really?
- No.

417
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,163
Definitely not wearing pajamas.

418
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,600
Hello.

419
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,411
No, no, no, Tess.

420
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,965
Tess, Tess.

421
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,964
Hello, hold on.

422
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,566
Tess, Tess.

423
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,410
Oh, oh, thank God.

424
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,443
Help me, please, help me.

425
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,126
She's... She's... Help...

426
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,324
What are you doing? What are
you doing? Help. Call someone.

427
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,566
- Call someone. Can't you see? She's dying.
- This woman has been dead for centuries.

428
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,961
Help!

429
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,649
You okay?

430
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,004
Do you think my
dad is still alive?

431
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,401
Yes, yes, he is. Of course.

432
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,331
Jesse only took your pop
to use as leverage.

433
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,448
He might be crazy,
but he's not stupid.

434
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,689
And everyone upstairs
is looking to find him.

435
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,680
So...

436
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,850
now I'm supposed to just leave my
dad's fate in the hands of a man...

437
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,924
who may have had something
to do with my mom's murder.

438
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,527
- Joe, I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

439
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,010
This doesn't make any sense. I
mean, if Wells is a murderer...

440
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,645
why does he wanna help me?

441
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,845
Why has he helped me stop so
many criminals, or saved Ronnie?

442
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,365
Why didn't I See this?

443
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,683
I spent a tenth as much time
with him as you did.

444
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,530
He almost had me
believing in him.

445
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,360
Almost.

446
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,445
Look.

447
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,211
Whatever else he is...

448
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,004
he is Harrison Wells.

449
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,930
You love science, he is science. It's
like you made best friends with Einstein.

450
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,007
You're saying I
wanted to be tricked.

451
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,802
You always wanna be the person
who sees the best in people.

452
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,571
I've been a cop for 25 years.
All I can see...

453
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,644
is the flaws, the lies.

454
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,810
The dark thoughts
that people think I don't see.

455
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,327
I wish I could be you.

456
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,720
As fast as you are...

457
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,321
that is your real power.

458
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,251
Don't let Wells
take that from you.

459
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,889
I don't know...

460
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,731
why he's helping us.

461
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,729
All that matters...

462
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,490
is that he is.

463
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,161
- I can't lose my dad, Joe.
- Barr.

464
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,845
Barr.

465
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,405
Come on.

466
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,921
Come on, come on.

467
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,408
Hi. Iris West, I'm with
Central City Picture News.

468
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,125
Thanks.

469
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,641
- Champagne, miss?
- Ah, thank you. Heh.

470
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,407
We're almost out of champagne.

471
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,888
Then the fun's about to begin.

472
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,731
Oh, Mayor Bellows.

473
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,003
- Hi. This is a lovely party.
- Thank you.

474
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,445
Welcome, welcome,
Central City's finest.

475
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,926
How about a toast?

476
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,810
To Mayor Anthony Bellows.

477
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,481
He doesn't just
yell at his staff...

478
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,165
he bellows.

479
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,649
You see what I did there
with the word play and the...?

480
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,968
- Tough crowd.
- Excuse me.

481
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,000
Who are you?

482
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,042
How quickly they forget.

483
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,685
James Jesse, your honor.

484
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,970
A.K.A., ha-ha-ha, the Trickster.

485
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,642
And I'm here to relieve
you fine people...

486
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,047
from all your money.
Because we know...

487
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,368
if you're in this
room, oh, ha, ha...

488
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,523
you've got loads of it.

489
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,251
What makes you think that anyone
would give you a cent?

490
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
Because...

491
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,044
that champagne they just slurped
down like so much fruit punch?

492
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,851
I added a little
something special to it.

493
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,044
Trimethylmercury-32.

494
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,400
Poison.

495
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,971
Without the antidote, you'll begin to
feel the effects in about, oh, um...

496
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,811
- One hour.
- One hour.

497
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,644
I remember you.

498
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,811
You got to the party
about an hour early.

499
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,402
I offered you the very
first glass of champagne.

500
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,722
An hour is plenty of time for all
of you to call your bankers...

501
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,725
and transfer everything you
have to the account number...

502
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,849
on the bottom of your glass.

503
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,407
Once my young friend
and I are rich...

504
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,644
you'll get the antidote.

505
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,401
If any of you decide
to call 911 instead, well...

506
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,410
then we switch
to lead poisoning.

507
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,361
- Anything?
- I'm scanning traffic cams.

508
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,891
- I got nothing.
- Hey, baby.

509
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,764
Iris?

510
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,689
How many of you feel the trimethylene-32
coursing through your veins?

511
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,041
- That's him, that's Jesse.
- Can you ping her phone?

512
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,526
I'm on it.

513
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,530
Trimethylmercury-32 is a
relatively fast-acting poison.

514
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,405
- Is there a cure?
- Yes. We can synthesize the antidote.

515
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,170
Cisco, where is she?

516
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,642
- City Hall.
- The mayor's having a fundraiser.

517
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,167
Barry, do not underestimate
the Trickster.

518
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,444
Well, hello.

519
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,564
You know, ahem...

520
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,928
I've been in
prison for 20 years.

521
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,600
Then you'll know the routine
when you get sent back.

522
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,280
Where's Henry Allen?

523
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,648
He's where you'll
be soon. Heaven.

524
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,803
Are you familiar
with the movie Speed?

525
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,962
Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock?

526
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,804
You're the bus and
that's the bomb.

527
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,804
Kinetic bomb, actually. If you
go below 600 miles per hour...

528
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,485
it'll explode.

529
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,087
Same thing happens
if you try to remove it.

530
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,921
Ooh! It's active, run, run, run.

531
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,280
Cisco.

532
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,800
He wasn't lying. That thing's
linked to a speedometer.

533
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,968
It will blow if you stop moving.

534
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,491
I can't run forever.

535
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,490
There's gotta be a way to get
it off him without damaging it.

536
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,764
- Barry, do you see any walls nearby?
- Why?

537
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,124
Because I need you to run into one.
Or more accurately, through one.

538
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,526
What?

539
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,323
If you vibrate at the
natural frequency of air...

540
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,524
your body, your cells, will
be in a state of excitement...

541
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,644
that should allow
you to phase...

542
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,128
right through that wall.
Leaving the bomb on the other side.

543
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,807
- Should?
- You can do this, I believe in you.

544
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,686
- I can't.
- Listen to me, Barry. Breathe.

545
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,288
Breathe.

546
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,845
Feel the air.

547
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,766
Feel that wind on your face.

548
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,200
Feel the ground.

549
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,684
Your feet lifting you up, pushing
you forward, and the lightning.

550
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,245
Barf)'-

551
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,002
Feel the lightning.

552
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,800
Feel its power.

553
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,644
Its electricity pumping
through your veins.

554
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,289
Crackling through you...

555
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,003
traveling to every nerve
in your body like a shock.

556
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,771
You're no longer you now.

557
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,327
You're part of
something greater.

558
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,091
You're part of a Speed Force.

559
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,360
It's yours.

560
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,402
Now do it.

561
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,368
- How?
- Barry?

562
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,369
Oh! That felt Weird.

563
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,849
I'm good.

564
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,606
Ooh, I like it.

565
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,690
Look at that.
Lobsters on me, kid.

566
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,408
It's okay, you've all been given
an antidote.

567
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,602
That wasn't very sanitary.

568
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,367
Where's Henry Allen? You're going
to prison either way, James.

569
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,520
All right.

570
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,764
You always did look good in red.

571
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,280
Wow.

572
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,323
Half of this stuff didn't even
exist when I was practicing.

573
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,003
I'd be happy to give you a crash
course on all of it if you get out.

574
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,200
I'm gonna shut up now.

575
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,800
That's okay.

576
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,850
Dr. Allen?

577
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,451
- Yes? - I'm feeling
the need to give you a hug.

578
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,883
Absolutely, I will
always accept a hug.

579
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,202
Thank you.

580
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,330
You gotta tell me:

581
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,809
What does it feel like when you're running
down the street like a bat out of hell?

582
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,201
There's no feeling like it.

583
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,049
I bet.

584
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,809
Actually, you're all heroes in my
book. Especially you, Dr. Wells.

585
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,561
Thank you. For everything
that you've done for my son.

586
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,327
Well, your son is an
extraordinary man, Dr. Allen.

587
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,650
I will do everything in my power
to ensure Barry's future.

588
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,721
It's time, Joe.

589
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,400
- No.
- No?

590
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,370
- No.
- Okay.

591
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,091
It seemed like you
could use a hug too.

592
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,084
Your father's an
extraordinary man.

593
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,570
You're lucky to have him.

594
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,045
I'm lucky to have you too.

595
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,563
Who are you?

596
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,722
My name is Eobard Thawne.

597
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,249
But that name doesn't matter, not
anymore. It won't matter for many years.

598
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,241
The only thing that really matters
is who you are. Harrison Wells.

599
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,171
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

600
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,689
In 2020, you and your
wife, Tess Morgan...

601
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,641
successfully launched a particle
accelerator that changed history.

602
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,923
I need it to happen a bit sooner
if I'm going to get back.

603
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,690
Much sooner.

604
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,760
What is that?

605
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,484
My way home.

606
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,810
You see...

607
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,842
they're not
coming to save you.

608
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,923
They're coming to save me.

609
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,440
Hi, Joe.

610
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,042
- Desk sergeant said you're
looking for me. - Hey, yeah, um...

611
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,205
Sit down.

612
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,208
It's about Iris.

613
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,927
She's looking into Mason
Bridge's disappearance.

614
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,929
We can't let that happen.

615
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,766
Detective.

616
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,926
Eddie, we need your help.

617
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,530
Brazil?

618
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,250
Why would...

619
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,250
Mason move to Brazil?

620
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,565
Apparently there
was a girl involved.

621
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,401
And he decided to go hike the
Amazon with her for a year.

622
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,763
You know, live off the grid,
write his memoirs or something.

623
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,122
Wow, I guess you really
don't know anyone.

624
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,968
- No, you don't.
- Hey, baby. Everything good?

625
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,766
Yeah, yeah, of course. Um...

626
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,969
- Dinner will be ready in a jiff, okay?
- Okay.

627
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,600
She buy it?

628
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,085
I think so.

629
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,127
Keeping her in the dark,
it's for her safety.

630
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,846
That is debatable
and we will have that debate.

631
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,324
But for right now,
what's our next move?

632
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,285
How do we figure out
what Wells is up to?

633
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,526
When Wells was talking
me through phasing...

634
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,240
so I could get the
Trickster's bomb off my wrist...

635
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,530
the way that he described
my being the Flash running...

636
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,131
feeling the wind...

637
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,124
and the power...

638
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,200
it's like he was
talking from experience.

639
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,440
What are you saying?

640
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,204
I don't know how...

641
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,647
but he's the man in yellow.

642
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,481
Harrison Wells is
the Reverse-Flash.

643
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,322
I got an 11-80,
possible 10-54...

644
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,524
County Road J,
requesting immediate assistance.

645
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,240
Copy that, units en
route to your location.

646
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,888
Sir, we're gonna
get you out of here.

647
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,567
Can you tell me your name?
Do you know who you are?

648
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,569
My name...

649
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,164
is...

650
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,966
Harrison Wells.
