7
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,400
Previously, on "Arrow"...

8
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,090
Why didn't you tell me about Sara?

9
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,070
Every time I bring her up, you end up evading it.

10
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,650
You killed Sara.

11
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,790
And I don't want you to tell anyone about this,

12
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,660
especially Laurel.

13
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,990
How could you have done this to me?

14
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,570
- Please do not do this-- - Just stop!

15
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,320
I will work with you to stop Ra's,

16
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,730
but never again will I be your daughter.

17
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,940
Oliver Queen is still alive.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,180
Somehow, Ta-er Al Sah-fer's killer still yet breathes.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,600
Yes, I know.

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,610
He has returned to Starling City, apparently.

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,240
Why did you not tell me?

22
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,810
I had a right to know that justice has not been done!

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,610
Because Oliver Queen did not murder Ta-er Al Sah-fer.

24
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,290
Do you not believe his own confession

25
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,630
because you doubt his motives

26
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,490
or because you don't approve of my grief?

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,620
- Sara was your beloved. - And you've never approved.

28
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,660
I knew Sara would leave us.

29
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,450
Leave you.

30
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,660
One way or the other.

31
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,620
I didn't approve of the love

32
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,020
that I knew would end only in heartbreak.

33
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,630
Whether Queen killed Sara or not,

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,910
he challenged you. He defied you.

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,350
For that alone, he must die.

36
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,090
Coordinate your attacks.

37
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,610
If you don't fight in unison,

38
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,830
your numbers become my advantage.

39
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,090
You both have a long way to go.

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,410
Particularly you, Oliver.

41
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,780
You've spent years preparing

42
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,900
to bring a bow and arrow to a sword fight.

43
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,850
That's almost funny coming from you,

44
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,300
considering you're the reason the League is targeting us.

45
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,090
Thea has the club closed for renovations.

46
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,960
I've reinforced all the entrances with A.R.G.U.S. Tech.

47
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,270
- We're secure. - John.

48
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,570
My friends call me Dig.

49
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,630
You shouldn't even speak to me.

50
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,220
If the club is as secure as Dig says,

51
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,280
perhaps you and Thea should relocate here.

52
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,140
We discussed that. Thea wants to stay in the loft.

53
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,760
I have only been able to survive in Starling City

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,950
because the League has no idea where in the city I am.

55
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,310
We are not leaving the loft.

56
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,200
You and your sister have the same stubbornness.

57
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,770
Clearly it comes from your mother's side of the family.

58
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,750
It's pretty amazing

59
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,770
how much Malcolm taught you in such a short time.

60
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,680
Yeah. He's father of the year.

61
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,690
Your fighting style, it--

62
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,880
it reminds me a bit of Sara.

63
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,930
That's, probably because

64
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,410
the same people taught Malcolm and her to fight.

65
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,570
I need to take a shower.

66
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,490
What?

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,660
I was going to ask for a favor, but I'm...

68
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,020
really more concerned about you at the moment, Oliver.

69
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:31,960
I'm fine.

70
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,950
You've been pushing it pretty hard with Malcolm Merlyn lately.

71
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,580
When's the last time you got a decent night's sleep?

72
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,940
I will sleep when this is over.

73
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,650
We recovered the Omega from Chien Na Wei.

74
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,000
We stole the Alpha from the Hong Kong military

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,570
and gave it to Amanda Waller.

76
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,380
Look, no matter how many times you make me say it,

77
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,210
it's not going to be any less true.

78
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,660
- That's enough. You're relieved. - Yes, sir.

79
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,050
Sorry. Waller's a little too thorough for her own good,

80
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,310
and by "Thorough," I think you know I mean paranoid.

81
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,750
Well, I've gotten used to it by now.

82
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,520
Where is she, anyway?

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,340
Well, the mop-up of the Alpha/Omega bioweapons problem

84
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,340
has become a United States army operation.

85
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,380
Ms. Waller's participation is concluded.

86
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,280
I'm sure that comes as a profound disappointment to you.

87
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,690
Oh, like you wouldn't believe.

88
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,930
I apologize for the invasiveness of your debrief.

89
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,170
And now that it's over, you're free to go.

90
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,100
The Yamashiros have been released, too.

91
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,730
They're returning to Japan. You go with them,

92
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,800
and from there, you can return to Starling

93
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,750
or go wherever else on earth you wish.

94
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,590
Thank you, General Shrieve.

95
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,440
After what you did, son...

96
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,720
That's the least I could do.

97
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,110
This is hardcore.

98
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,470
When Dig said he was fortifying the club,

99
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,960
I figured there'd just be a few extra locks and cameras.

100
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,690
Are you ok?

101
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,620
No. No, not really.

102
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,810
What's wrong?

103
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,090
Ollie told me that I can't tell anyone.

104
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,540
Whatever it is,

105
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,930
you have to be able to talk about it with someone.

106
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,800
Someone who's not your brother.

107
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,720
I killed Sara.

108
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,380
- It was Malcolm. He-- - I know.

109
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,650
And none of you told me?

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,510
You know last year when I kind of went off the rails for a bit?

111
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,350
Yeah...

112
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,310
I was also under the influence of something.

113
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,020
And just like you,

114
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,910
I killed someone.

115
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,690
A cop.

116
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,060
Roy...

117
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,450
They didn't tell me, either.

118
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,000
And when--when I found out...

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,580
You wished that you didn't know.

120
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,290
Look, I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that

121
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,500
the feeling ever goes away,

122
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,270
but I can tell you that it gets easier, Thea.

123
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,000
You don't have to see that cop's family

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,740
almost every single day.

125
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,000
I can't imagine that it's going to get any easier.

126
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,940
And I don't think that it should.

127
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,380
So he is alive. There were doubts.

128
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,480
Do you have any idea what happens

129
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,770
to the stock price of Palmer Technology

130
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,670
when Palmer goes missing for a week...

131
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,170
It's been a week?

132
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,130
I've been a little distracted.

133
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,320
I can't get the gauntlet module

134
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,800
to interface with the helmet system.

135
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,530
I've been working the problem, but I can't--

136
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,930
- Stop! - Yeah, I imagined you'd say that,

137
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,000
but this is the last step towards the suit becoming operational,

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,570
- and a little facial hair is a small price to pay-- - Stop!

139
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,580
This is a subsonic ionizer.

140
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,290
If you try to use it on quadband circuitry,

141
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,980
- it could result-- - In a catalytic reaction

142
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,400
that could destroy the entire building.

143
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,070
You need to get some sleep.

144
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,410
I will, once I've cracked the problem.

145
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,470
Or blow yourself up?

146
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,700
Whichever comes first.

147
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,710
Ray?

148
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,920
When those men killed Anna,

149
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,240
I promised myself

150
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,390
I would never feel that helpless again.

151
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,870
So, can you even imagine how I felt

152
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,220
when Brick's men took a portion of the city hostage?

153
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,840
Lousy. We all did.

154
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,350
But if you're punishing yourself--

155
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,450
I'm not--I'm not punishing myself.

156
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,340
I'm focused on the task at hand.

157
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,410
Too focused, clearly.

158
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,530
I'm sorry, but I've got a lot of work to do.

159
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,750
Hey, dad. It's me. Again.

160
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,960
Listen, I know you're upset

161
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,660
and you have every right to be, but

162
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,630
it's been over a week, and now that you know the truth,

163
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,200
neither of us should go through this alone, so,

164
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,420
please call me back.

165
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,310
I love you.

166
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,820
Hey. What are you doing here?

167
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,670
I--I need to talk to you.

168
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,370
Is everything all right?

169
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,070
No. It's about Sara.

170
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,910
OK.

171
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,980
Malcolm drugged me.

172
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,900
He gave me something that made me...

173
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,430
susceptible to suggestion, and I--

174
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,300
Thea...what are you talking about?

175
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,140
I killed Sara.

176
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,070
I didn't know what I was doing, ok?

177
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,210
It wasn't me.

178
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,940
I'm so sorry, Laurel.

179
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,710
If Merlyn drugged you...

180
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,440
then it wasn't your fault.

181
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,590
But how could you work with him?

182
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,740
How could you stand by his side?

183
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,750
Because of the threat of the League.

184
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,290
We have to work with him.

185
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,460
I don't have a choice.

186
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,140
Yes, you do.

187
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,630
What happened wasn't your fault, Thea,

188
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,340
because it wasn't your decision.

189
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,200
If you want to make this right,

190
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,410
what you do from now on...that is.

191
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,670
I can't remember Sara's smile.

192
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,350
It's weird, isn't it?

193
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,850
I mean, I know Sara used to smile

194
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,760
and--and laugh,

195
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,220
but when I close my eyes and I try and picture it,

196
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,600
all I see is the way that I found her.

197
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,770
You know, sometimes, the only thing that keeps me going

198
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,190
is the thought of one day finding her killer.

199
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,320
We will.

200
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,980
I promise.

201
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,790
How do you do that?

202
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,300
- Do what? - Lie.

203
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,680
Right to my face.

204
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,920
Thea told me, Oliver. She told me everything.

205
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,840
How could you keep this from me?

206
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,740
After what you wanted to do to Lacroix and Merlyn?

207
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,970
Do you really need to ask me that question?

208
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,050
I'm not so consumed with vengeance

209
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,900
that I blame Thea for Sara's death.

210
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,050
I blame Malcolm Merlyn.

211
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,270
I need him.

212
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,870
He murdered my sister.

213
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,970
With the League targeting us,

214
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,950
he is the only chance I have of saving mine.

215
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,700
This is how it has to be.

216
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,570
It's really amazing...

217
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,270
the way Merlyn always finds a way

218
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,490
under your protection.

219
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,080
I'm sorry, Laurel.

220
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,420
You know, it's hard to remember a time...

221
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,450
when I was actually in love with you.

222
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,610
I told you not to tell anyone.

223
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,290
I guess I'm just not as good at keeping secrets as you are.

224
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,870
Thea, I'm not gonna pretend that I understand

225
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,300
all the different types of pain that you're in,

226
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,190
but the threat, it is very real.

227
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,460
And the only way that we are gonna survive

228
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,100
is by acting in unison.

229
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,930
Are you really quoting Malcolm Merlyn to me right now?

230
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,510
Yes. Because he, better than anyone,

231
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,990
understands the danger the 3 of us are facing.

232
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,510
We're not in any danger.

233
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,830
Not anymore. Not you or me.

234
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,810
But Malcolm, he's going to face justice.

235
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,350
Thea, what have you done?

236
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,070
You're clearly not League of Assassins.

237
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,180
They wouldn't be this sloppy.

238
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,960
That's right. I forgot.

239
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,950
Oliver mentioned you were having some identity issues,

240
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,810
though he didn't mention about your delusions of Grandeur.

241
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,020
You killed my sister, you stupid son of a bitch!

242
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,630
Now you're just embarrassing yourself.

243
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,810
Your sister's teacher was my teacher.

244
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,670
Did you think you could really dispatch me with a stick?

245
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,550
No.

246
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,830
I suppose we're gonna see if being a killer

247
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,030
runs in the family.

248
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,610
Step aside, Laurel.

249
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,290
Nyssa!

250
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,920
This does not concern you.

251
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,060
We've come for Al-Saher.

252
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,470
You swore to me that you didn't kill Sara.

253
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,210
I never believed you.

254
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,040
It is admirable of you to honor your sister,

255
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,160
but you can rest now. Sara's murder is avenged.

256
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,820
Where is she?

257
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,810
I told you Merlyn was off limits.

258
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,490
I know. And then I realized

259
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,530
that I didn't really give a damn.

260
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,210
This is why I keep secrets from you.

261
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,840
Because you let your emotions dictate your actions,

262
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,030
and it is gonna get you killed.

263
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,630
Did you really think that you had a chance

264
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,070
against Malcolm Merlyn?

265
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,610
Nyssa and the League kidnapped Merlyn.

266
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,340
I know.

267
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,030
Thea traded Merlyn for safety.

268
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,800
She was able to contact the League

269
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,590
because they are in town on the hunt.

270
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,530
Merlyn has a video of Thea killing Sara.

271
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,690
First thing he's gonna do is show that to Ra's.

272
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,290
Then we're right back at square one.

273
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,590
That video was a bluff

274
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,310
to make me challenge Ra's.

275
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,760
Merlyn loves Thea. He would never just

276
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,090
serve her up.

277
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,000
We have to get him back.

278
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,830
What?

279
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,770
Yeah. I'm with her, because

280
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,200
it just sounded like you wanted to

281
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,310
rescue Malcolm Merlyn from the League.

282
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,190
My sister did this because she is angry.

283
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,530
Eventually, she will settle down and realize

284
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,220
that she basically just killed her own father.

285
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,850
There's no coming back from that.

286
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,050
The guilt will just eat away at her

287
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,420
until there is nothing left.

288
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,010
Please.

289
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,110
I'll start with the private airfields.

290
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,960
No. Oliver,

291
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,540
Merlyn murdered my sister

292
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,830
and corrupted yours and now

293
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,960
you want to save him?

294
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,170
I'm trying to save Thea's soul.

295
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,200
You're out of your mind.

296
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,740
And you don't need to be here.

297
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,290
I got something.

298
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,080
Unless it's a big, fat coincidence

299
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,950
that the security cameras at Starling City aviation just went dark.

300
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,970
I'll handle it.

301
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,070
I'm going home!

302
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,020
We hope you'll consider staying with us

303
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,400
in Tokyo for a day or two

304
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,800
before you leave for Starling City.

305
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,680
Don't pressure him, Tatsu.

306
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,370
He's been away from home a long time.

307
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,050
You can stay with us forever.

308
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,060
I like playing games with Oliver.

309
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,880
Well, maybe I can send my family's plane,

310
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,520
and then you and you parents could vacation in America.

311
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,850
Your family owns a plane?

312
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,120
It's more of a jet.

313
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,980
I see it! I see it! I see our boat!

314
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,970
I hate boats.

315
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,290
Oliver.

316
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,740
What is it?

317
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,150
Hell will be a paradise compared to what

318
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,350
my father has in store for you, Al Sa-her.

319
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,480
Only because of my undertaking.

320
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,850
Your father doesn't care about Sara's death

321
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,290
just as you know in your heart

322
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,120
that your relationship with Sara

323
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,840
has cost you any chance of taking

324
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,380
your father's place.

325
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,650
Get him aboard. I'll deal with this one.

326
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,070
Your sister told us Merlyn killed Sara.

327
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,620
Are you so lost you'd deprive me of my justice?

328
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,940
This isn't justice. It's vengeance.

329
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,760
Vengeance is justice.

330
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,900
Go!

331
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,240
He's gone.

332
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,590
Malcolm Merlyn will never be seen again.

333
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,250
So, what's the play? Trade her for Malcolm?

334
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,850
Ra's will not make that deal.

335
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,990
Even for his own daughter.

336
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,580
What are you doing with her?

337
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,670
She's a source of information... and leverage.

338
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,040
I need the room.

339
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,520
You're gonna torture her to find out

340
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,000
where Nanda Parbat is?

341
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,630
I need the room.

342
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,300
Everyone clear out.

343
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,290
Oliver, listen. I know what you're doing

344
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,670
and I know why you're doing it.

345
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,590
But you can't save Thea's soul

346
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,840
at the cost of your own.

347
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,920
Laurel was right.

348
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,230
I need to know where Nanda Parbat is.

349
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,330
Was she also correct you

350
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,610
intend to torture me for that information?

351
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,590
No. Because we know I won't have to.

352
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,860
You placed Sara's killer under your protection.

353
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,380
Your every action has been aimed

354
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,400
towards the frustration of justice.

355
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,360
I will gladly tell you

356
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,870
where to find my home...

357
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,640
because you will die there.

359
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,090
It's like "Mission: Impossible" in here.

360
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,420
Yeah, that's the idea.

361
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,400
Make it impossible for the League to get the drop on us.

362
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,420
I thought Thea got us off their hit list.

363
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,110
Yeah, that was before we put Ra's Al Ghul's

364
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,350
daughter in a box.

365
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,650
Taking prisoners now. Isn't that crossing a line?

366
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,890
Actually, Oliver has an entire prison On Lian Yu.

367
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,800
Maybe I shouldn't have told you that.

368
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,840
Nanda Parbat is hidden beneath the Hindu Kush.

369
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,880
That was quick.

370
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,450
She wanted to tell me.

371
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,890
Thinks I'm gonna die there.

372
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,250
She's not the only one.

373
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,900
I understand facing Ra's

374
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,350
when you were doing it for Thea, but--

375
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,490
I am doing it for thea.

376
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,710
Look, I may not agree with it,

377
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,780
but I understand what you're trying to say.

378
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,470
You don't want Thea to live with the guilt

379
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,770
of getting her own father killed.

380
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,950
But how is her brother dying any better?

381
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,770
I don't plan on dying.

382
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,870
That's what you said the last time

383
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,970
you went to go face Ra's,

384
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,570
and how did that turn out for you?

385
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,370
Oliver, I'm about as angry with you right now

386
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,930
than I've been with anyone in my life,

387
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,360
but that doesn't mean I want you going

388
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,260
on a suicide mission.

389
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,280
You're unusually quiet.

390
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,180
Yeah.

391
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,590
Guys, want to give us a minute?

392
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,000
So, Thea served up Merlyn.

393
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,480
You want to save her from regretting that decision.

394
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,020
Yeah, I get it.

395
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,450
- But? - But Oliver, I can't shake the feeling

396
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,090
that there's something more at play here.

397
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,590
It's Thea. Plain and simple.

398
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,590
Are you sure?

399
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,190
Right now, it's the only thing

400
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,630
I am sure about.

405
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,190
What the hell?

406
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,680
Did you get locked out of

407
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,410
the Palmer Technologies server?

408
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,730
That's a shame.

409
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,040
You did this?

410
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,640
I just came from a friend of mine

411
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,550
who has his head shoved so far up his colon that--

412
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,820
and I'm pretty sure this is true--

413
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,090
he's literally going to get himself killed.

414
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,360
Him, I can't do anything about.

415
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,460
You're a different story.

416
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,250
Great. Why don't you tell me the story

417
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,500
while you unlock the atom subroutine directory?

418
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,830
You have two options, Ray.

419
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,850
Option One-- you can find a way to

420
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,630
break through the encryption that I used

421
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,250
to lock up your server, which, by my calculations,

422
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,780
will take you roughly 6.25 hours.

423
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,980
Or you can use that time to eat a proper meal,

424
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,970
take a shower,

425
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,020
and get no less than 5 hours of sleep,

426
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,320
at the completion of which

427
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,250
I will give you the password.

428
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,040
I see.

429
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,360
It's your choice, but I highly recommend

430
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,260
option two, because this whole situation

431
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,620
has gone from endearingly eccentric

432
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,520
to creepily not ok.

433
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,750
If I had the energy, I think I'd be getting angry right now,

434
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,740
but instead... I'll just take option two.

435
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,520
That's a wise choice.

436
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,730
After your dinner and a shower,

437
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,530
I am taking you straight to bed.

438
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,420
Putting you.

439
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,100
Why do I do that?

440
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,420
I didn't hear you come in.

441
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,540
Why can something so small

442
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,040
change the way you view the entire world?

443
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,740
What did Oliver say?

444
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,470
Did you ask him?

445
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,580
Oliver has other things on his mind.

446
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,630
Like what?

447
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,890
He's going to Nanda Parbat.

448
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,150
Cheating death once wasn't enough for him?

449
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,740
He's convinced he's doing the right thing.

450
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,590
Is he?

451
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,520
You going with him?

452
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,390
Oliver has to do what's right by his family.

453
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,000
I have to do what's right by mine.

454
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,980
Is that why you didn't go the last time?

455
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,830
Last time, I didn't go because Oliver wouldn't let me.

456
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,990
And when you thought he died, you blamed yourself.

457
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,060
I don't want to see you put yourself through that again.

458
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,910
I can't stop Oliver from going.

459
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,220
Then go with him.

460
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,160
You might have hung up the uniform, Johnnie,

461
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,490
but you're still a soldier.

462
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,740
Standing down while your friend goes into battle

463
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,350
just isn't in your DNA.

464
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,220
Just get there and back in one piece.

465
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,020
About that.

466
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,950
You think we could borrow the A.R.G.U.S. jet?

467
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,750
What the hell do you think that you're doing?

468
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,010
Roy told you?

469
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,800
Roy and Laurel.

470
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,030
They both think that you're out of your mind.

471
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,180
Me, I know it for sure.

472
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,160
I'm doing this for you.

473
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,750
If your father dies because of something that you've done,

474
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,500
There's a piece of you that will go missing

475
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,260
and you'll never be able to get it back.

476
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,870
That I can live with

477
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,280
but not you dying because of me.

478
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,550
I am not gonna die,

479
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,520
and the only reason that you think you can live

480
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,940
with Malcolm's death is because

481
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,420
you don't really know

482
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,620
what it's like to take a life.

483
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,950
You're a good person, Thea.

484
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,330
Both of our parents are dead because of me.

485
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,720
And that guilt..

486
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,760
tat's something that I have to live with.

487
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,690
I don't want that for you.

488
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,900
No, please.

489
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,920
Please just don't go.

490
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,920
I'll be back as soon as I can.

491
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,010
We got a Gulfstream spinning up at Starling City aviation.

492
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,820
I can't ask you to come with me, Diggle.

493
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,180
You didn't ask me, Oliver.

494
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,190
Besides, you don't own a jet anymore.

495
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,510
In 1854, I encountered an illusionist in Vienna,

496
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,290
and he was dazzling,

497
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,680
magnificent,

498
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,090
powerful,

499
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,130
and then nearly half a century later,

500
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,130
I stumbled upon this man again.

501
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,840
He was withered,

502
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,190
broken,

503
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
dying.

504
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,900
You see, a magician

505
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,640
can cheat many things

506
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,980
except one.

507
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,520
Please.

508
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,310
I was your horseman.

509
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,930
Let me hunt for you once more.

510
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,700
Allow me to prove to you

511
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,040
my reborn loyalty.

512
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,980
Al Sa-her, face your death with honor.

513
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,700
Or at least dignity.

514
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,750
Please don't do this.

515
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,580
There is a price you must pay for your crimes

516
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,770
that can only be measured in agony and blood,

517
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,840
but know I will take no pleasure in this.

518
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,970
Take him away.

519
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,140
No.

520
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,120
No! No! No!

521
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,860
Shut... up.

522
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,070
Is this an actual Van Gogh--

524
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,020
It's a Vermeer actually.

525
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,590
I rotate the paintings out here with my collection at Starling Museum.

526
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,240
Yeah. I'm really into the Dutch masters this month for some reason.

527
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,870
You're very attractive.

528
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,170
I mean, they are.

529
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,430
You were right.

530
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,490
Food was delicious, the shower was amazing.

531
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,810
Thank you for insisting on it.

532
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,410
Well, a deal's a deal.

533
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,820
Password's inside.

534
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,650
You didn't have to.

535
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,470
Blackmail me.

536
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,220
I trust your judgment.

537
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,130
In fact, I pretty much depend on it.

538
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,130
Well, that would make you the only one.

539
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,720
You know, I can be as obsessive and stubborn

540
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,700
as the ex-billionaire,

541
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,220
but I do know the value of somebody calling me on it,

542
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,300
telling me when the emperor has no clothes.

543
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,610
Speaking of.

544
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,150
Right.

545
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,480
You know what?

546
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,060
Sometimes, I forget that we work together.

547
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,570
When I'm with you, just you.

548
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,940
I don't think about work or the mission or...

549
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,620
I'm sorry.

550
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,870
I'm not.

551
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,410
There it is.

552
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,550
Nanda Parbat.

553
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,890
Centuries old, never taken by force.

554
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,360
Then why are we doing this, Oliver?

555
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,420
I mean, why are we really doing this?

556
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,180
The league will have sentries patrolling the area.

557
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,220
If they spot us,

558
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,720
we cannot let them get away.

559
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,620
Surprise is our only advantage.

560
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,600
I'd say they've spotted us.

561
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,840
What's your count?

562
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,750
6 on the south side,

563
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,330
probably another 4 on the east.

565
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,030
I don't want to go out like Butch and Sundance,

566
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,150
so what's the plan?

567
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,800
Shoot straighter than they do.

568
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,050
Cover me.

569
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,840
If he gets to the fortress before we do,

570
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,710
we're dead.

571
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,680
He won't.

573
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,890
One sniper on the roof.

574
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,120
They're A.R.G.U.S.

575
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,170
They work for Waller.

576
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,250
Waller?!

577
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,200
General Shrieve said she wasn't involved anymore.

578
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,470
Maybe that decision didn't sit well with her.

579
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,410
We can't stay here!

580
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,400
Delivery truck.

581
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,310
That sniper will take us out before we get there.

582
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,940
Toss me your gun. I'll cover you.

583
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,970
Thank me later. Give me your gun.

585
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,770
I am the prisoner,

586
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,980
yet you look the more tortured.

587
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,020
By now, Al Sa-her is in the presence of my father.

588
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,960
His last hours will be spent in agony,

589
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,780
begging for death.

590
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,940
That doesn't please you.

591
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,470
I thought it would.

592
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,510
Having Merlyn to hate, it's...

593
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,730
it's like a piece of Sara that I can still hold on to,

594
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,300
but once he's gone...

595
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,570
so is another part of her.

596
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,660
She would want to be avenged.

597
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,000
Can you remember the sound of Sara's laugh?

598
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,730
When Sara was first brought before my father,

599
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,140
the moment he weighed her apprenticeship or her execution,

600
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,910
she bore witness to a demonstration of his power,

601
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,360
one that inspired her and all who had come before,

602
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,340
but sara...

603
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,700
laughed.

604
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,900
It was so innocent, so genuine.

605
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,450
That was the moment I fell in love with her, I think.

606
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,670
All I knew,

607
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,590
all I craved was to hear her laugh once more.

608
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,020
Thank you.

610
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,430
This place is humongous.

611
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,680
How do we find Merlyn in all of this.

612
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,360
The nanites that I tagged him with 4 months ago,

613
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,720
this can track them.

614
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,890
Down!

615
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,550
Thanks.

616
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,960
Oh, my God.

617
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:13,310
Malcolm. Help me get him down.

618
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,270
Trap. Trap.

619
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:27,470
Mr. Queen, welcome to Nanda Parbat.

620
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,540
Oliver!

621
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,050
Oliver.

622
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,060
Yeah. I tried that already. Nothing's happening.

623
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,630
We need to get out of here now.

624
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,680
Yeah. Save your strength. I have a feeling we're gonna need it.

625
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,800
I'm not gonna let you die down here.

626
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,020
I don't think that's up to you.

627
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,910
I shouldn't have let you come.

628
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,870
Also not up to you, Oliver.

629
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,410
You don't understand.

630
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,180
I think I do.

631
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,810
You forget I know you sometimes better than you know yourself.

632
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,650
Maybe you could have told me I wasn't doing this for Thea before we left.

633
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,900
You are doing it for Thea...

634
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,880
but, yeah, you're right. It's not just about her.

635
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,940
You know, every time I close my eyes,

636
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,800
all that I can see,

637
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,280
all that I can hear, feel is...

638
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,320
just the fall.

639
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,560
I couldn't live like that,

640
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,520
couldn't live knowing that...

641
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,140
there was someone out there who beat me.

642
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,520
Yeah, that makes sense.

643
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,620
No. It's egotistical and insane.

644
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,450
So is putting on a mask and jumping off of rooftops, Oliver.

645
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,350
To do that, you have to be in a certain mindset.

646
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,200
Every soldier on the battlefield, man,

647
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,350
has to believe he's coming home. Otherwise, he's paralyzed.

648
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,290
Ra's got in your head.

649
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,720
What was the favor you wanted to ask me?

650
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,880
I don't think now is the right time.

651
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,110
We're not dead yet.

652
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,540
Now might be the only time.

653
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,350
I always assumed if I ever got married again

654
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,120
that Andy would be by my side.

655
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,750
When I lost my brother...

656
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,840
I never thought I'd get another one.

657
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,340
So pretending for a moment that

658
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,400
we aren't two dead men chained to the floor...

659
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,960
how you feel about being my best man?

660
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:46,380
I feel pretty good about it.

661
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,140
Oliver, it's time.

662
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,940
I counted at least 3 shooters.

663
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,210
Move!

664
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,380
Maseo!

665
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,410
Go! Get him out of here! Go!

666
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,070
Akio! Akio!

667
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,440
Akio!

668
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,750
Really starting to wonder why I decided to come with you.

669
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,060
I told you I want to show you

670
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,140
how I deal with the things that you're going through.

671
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,460
That's Michelle Vincent

672
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,390
and her son Rory. He's 4.

673
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,760
Roy, why are you stalking some random family?

674
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,160
They're not random.

675
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,740
That's them. That's the police officer's family?

676
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,220
I give them cash,

677
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,010
bring them groceries.

678
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,030
I even got Rory a boba fett for Christmas.

679
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,440
Don't worry. They don't know it's me.

680
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,190
You're torturing yourself.

681
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,550
No. It helps actually.

682
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,950
It helps me with the guilt.

683
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,070
Look. I appreciate what you're doing here,

684
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,960
showing me this,

685
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,970
but the cop and Sara...

686
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,040
they're just not the same thing.

687
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,340
You weren't any more in control of yourself than--than I was.

688
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,750
I know, not when I killed Sara,

689
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,500
but when I traded Malcolm to the League,

690
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,790
when I let him into my life,

691
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,630
I knew exactly who he was,

692
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,240
what he was.

693
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,880
He taught me how to kill.

694
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,060
Maybe I am a killer.

695
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,970
Maybe that's the real me,

696
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,620
and I deserve to be punished.

697
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,830
I don't believe that.

698
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,170
I just tried to have my father murdered.

699
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,270
Can you please just take me home?

701
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,190
I'm in no mood for conversation.

702
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,760
You'll want to hear this.

703
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,760
There's something that I need to tell you.

704
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,380
I can't live without you knowing.

705
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,350
The guilt is far worse than anything you could do to me.

706
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,140
I lied to you.

707
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,420
And you believed it...

708
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,680
when I told you that Malcolm killed Sara.

709
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,000
He wanted her dead

710
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,740
to put certain things in motion,

711
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,270
But I am the one

712
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,160
who fired those arrows into her chest,

713
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,120
and when I made the deal

714
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,700
to give up Malcolm,

715
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,270
I promised you your vengeance.

716
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,560
So take it.

717
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,010
You tasted death,

718
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,680
and you wanted more,

719
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,160
But the truth is

720
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,660
everyone and everything must come to an end,

721
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,860
even for one such as me.

722
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,080
Kill me,

723
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,010
but spare John Diggle's life. Let him go.

724
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,190
I will beg for it.

725
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,050
You have shown tremendous strength,

726
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,630
fortitude, power.

727
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,510
No, Mr. Queen, I don't want to kill you.

728
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,810
I want you to take my place.

729
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,530
I want you to become the next Ra's Al Ghul.
