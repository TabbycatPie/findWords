00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:05,806
<i>In March of 2009, I'd been
dating my high school girlfriend Karen</i>

2
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:07,005
<i>for a few weeks.</i>

3
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:08,946
<i>My friends could not have
been less excited.</i>

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,518
- Hey, everybody.
Hello.

5
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,109
Sorry, we can't stay long.

6
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:15,812
- What a shame!
- That is sad!

7
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:17,585
Hey, are those real diamond earrings?

8
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:20,719
Yes. Yes, they are. Thank you.

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,889
I didn't say I liked them.

10
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:25,524
Oh, well, I got a great deal on them, so...

11
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:28,399
Cool. I'm sure all the exploited
diamond miners in Sierra Leone

12
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:31,303
would give you a high-five
if they still had all their fingers,

13
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:33,342
but really pretty.

14
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:35,104
Meet me upstairs.

15
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:37,611
They only need one finger
to give her what I'm thinking.

16
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:40,809
Yeah. Ted, Karen's a douche.

17
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:42,510
Wow. Thanks for sugarcoating it.

18
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,315
"Douche" is sugarcoating it.

19
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:48,491
Okay, believe it or not, my friends
do not get a vote on who I date.

20
00:00:48,593 --> 00:00:50,494
It's my life. I call the shots.

21
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:52,928
- Ted, now!
- Yeah, coming!

22
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,735
I don't know what Ted sees
in that horrible woman.

23
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,337
I mean, yeah, she's got boobs, but...

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,907
I guess I get it.

25
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:04,033
I think it's 'cause they met in high school.

26
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:06,009
She was his first real girlfriend.

27
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:08,011
We look at Karen and see a jerk.

28
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:10,413
Ted looks at Karen and sees
the first person to touch his wiener

29
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:13,385
besides himself,
his mom and his pediatrician.

30
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:16,047
Okay, well, it's almost 2:00 a. m.
I better get ready for work.

31
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:19,456
How can they call that thing
you're on a morning show?

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,893
4:00 a. m. is still the middle of the night.

33
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:23,487
I don't see how you do it.

34
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:26,192
It's been almost a month. I'm used to it.

35
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:28,132
Plus the show's not half bad, right?

36
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:30,535
- Totally.
- We've never seen it.

37
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:32,439
Have you guys ever watched it?

38
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:34,237
- Of course!
- They've never seen it.

39
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,970
Really? What is your favorite segment?

40
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:37,170
- Weather.
- Never seen it.

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,111
- You guys have never seen my show?
- Sorry.

42
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:41,707
- It's true.
- That's what I've been saying.

43
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,255
Okay, yes, it's dull and generic
and we get spanked in the ratings

44
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,086
by that Korean channel
that only shows Kim Jong II riding a horse,

45
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:52,459
but, guys, it would mean so much to me
if just once

46
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:55,397
I knew my friends were
out there watching.

47
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:57,662
I'll tell you what,

48
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:00,863
this Friday morning, everyone
can come to our place, 3:30 a. m.

49
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:03,874
We'll all put on PJs.
We'll watch Robin's show.

50
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:06,101
Aw, you guys are the best.

51
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:07,509
We just want to support you.

52
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:10,638
I just want to go to sleep.

53
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,915
I hate Robin for not being more successful.

54
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:16,018
Hey, guys.

55
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:20,958
Sad announcement.
Karen broke up with me.

56
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:24,687
Go ahead.

57
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,528
I knew you were listening! Yes!

58
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:45,577
Hey, hey, we shouldn't be celebrating.

59
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:48,486
Ted's just been through a bad breakup.

60
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:51,185
Look, buddy, tell us everything.
Tell us what happened.

61
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:53,286
Seriously, spare no details.

62
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:57,333
What did she say?
What did you say? How did it feel?

63
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:01,899
If you were to do it again,
all over, would you maybe...

64
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:06,410
- How did it happen?
- It was the stupidest thing.

65
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:10,311
I mean, we were just hanging out,
you know, being funny.

66
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:13,250
You're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.

67
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:16,947
Ew! No, you're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.

68
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:19,416
Wait. What is this?

69
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,420
Looks like one of Robin's earrings.
Huh! That's weird.

70
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:26,031
- You're the fan...
- How did it get in your bed?

71
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,532
I don't know.

72
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:30,796
- Have you been sleeping with Robin?
- What? No, of course not!

73
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:33,464
It probably got mixed in
with the laundry or something.

74
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:34,872
Why should I believe you?

75
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:37,877
Um, maybe because I've always been
faithful to you,

76
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:40,607
while you've cheated on me,
like, six times, bitch.

77
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:42,805
- Snap!
- Cold-blooded!

78
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,350
Right? Right?

79
00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:46,919
Yeah, I totally should have said that.

80
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:48,517
Why should I believe you?

81
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:54,119
Um, maybe because I've always been
faithful to you, while you...

82
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:56,896
I love you.

83
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:01,901
I knew this was a mistake.
That's it. It's over.

84
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:05,901
And that was it. She left.

85
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,946
What a story.
So brave of you to share that.

86
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:14,780
Wait. Those are your pajamas?
You sleep in a pajama suit?

87
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:17,218
Of course. What do you think I sleep in?

88
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:18,686
A coffin.

89
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:21,785
Dude, that doesn't look comfortable at all.

90
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:25,921
- You're wearing a tie.
- First of all, it's a sleeping cravat.

91
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,530
Second, it's not about comfort.

92
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,967
It's about looking good all the time.

93
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,129
Why do you have to look good
all the time?

94
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,241
Marshall, let me tell you a little story
about something

95
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,639
that happened a couple of months back.

96
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,521
Hi. We were just having
a "Who's hornier?" contest

97
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,490
and we spilled massage oil
all over ourselves.

98
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,595
- Nice pajamas.
- Can we use your shower?

99
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:59,693
That's not a memory.
That's from a porn movie.

100
00:04:59,802 --> 00:05:03,294
Not just any movie.
That's the exact scene from...

101
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,708
- Never mind.
- The point is it could happen.

102
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:11,678
And if it did, and I didn't look
my absolute best for those greasy sluts,

103
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:13,249
I'd regret it forever.

104
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:17,487
I'm sorry, dude, but that is just
the most ridiculous sleeping attire

105
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:20,386
I've ever seen in my life. Anyway...

106
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,561
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!

107
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:26,323
Hey, guys, you know how in the future
we're always saying,

108
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:27,592
"Remember when
Marshall wore a nightgown?"

109
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,167
This is that time!

110
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:30,257
It's a nightshirt.

111
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:33,338
You can call it
a Ninja Star Danger Jock if you want,

112
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,100
doesn't make you
any less of a cross-dresser.

113
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:36,469
Whatever, dude. It's comfy.

114
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:37,542
Uh-huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

115
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:40,305
So, flying to Neverland
with Peter and Tink, was that amazing?

116
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:41,812
Ooh! Let me go next!

117
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:44,110
Was it nice to finally get out of
that crowded bed

118
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:47,983
and take Charlie to the chocolate factory?
Ooh! Me, me, me, me!

119
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:50,580
Something about Scrooge!

120
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:53,453
Come on, guys. I'm carrying the team.

121
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,390
I don't know.
I lived with Marshall for 12 years.

122
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:59,763
Any time he's wearing
clothes at all, it's a victory.

123
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:04,971
Ted, show's about to start!
- Be right there!

124
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:20,948
<i>Good morning, New York. I'm...</i>

125
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:22,889
- Hey!
- Whoa!

126
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,388
Marshall, I just found Robin's earring
on your dresser.

127
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:28,761
Did you have something to do with
the other one being in my bed?

128
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,698
- What are you talking about?
- You've always hated Karen.

129
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:32,963
You've been telling me
to break up with her.

130
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:36,529
You did it. You put the earring
in my bed so that Karen would find it.

131
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:37,767
No, Ted! No! I would never...

132
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:39,503
- Admit it!
- There's nothing to admit!

133
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:41,443
Then why was Robin's earring
on your dresser?

134
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:43,105
He was accessorizing!

135
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:46,116
Marshall, I swear to God, if you
don't tell me the truth right now...

136
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:49,187
Wait! Marshall didn't do it.

137
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,750
I did.

138
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:54,524
I broke you and Karen up.

139
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,568
You broke me and Karen up?
Are you insane?

140
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:07,129
- What gives you the right to do that?
- Ted, I did it for your own good.

141
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:10,369
You just weren't seeing
how awful she was.

142
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:12,640
She failed the front porch test.

143
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:14,843
What's the front porch test?

144
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,817
Ted, you, me and Marshall have
been best friends since college.

145
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:21,857
Think about how much
we all mean to each other.

146
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,052
So when I picture the future,
I picture us all together.

147
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:29,858
<i>How we'll all be retired, sipping tea
on the front porch of our beach house,</i>

148
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,594
<i>playing bridge all day.</i>

149
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:36,867
Okay, bridges are wild.
Four of a bridge beats a royal bridge.

150
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,636
I see your bridge,
and I raise you three bridges.

151
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:42,838
Bridge! I win!

152
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:45,340
You have no idea
how to play bridge, do you?

153
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,045
- We're gonna take a class.
- It's important to stay active.

154
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:51,815
So whenever you've been dating
somebody for a while,

155
00:07:51,924 --> 00:07:53,983
I do the front porch test.

156
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:58,095
You know, how is this person gonna
fit in with our group over the years?

157
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:00,324
And when I think about Karen there...

158
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,794
Bridge! I win!

159
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:05,268
Fantastic. Another game of bridge.

160
00:08:05,472 --> 00:08:07,372
Don't read a book or anything.

161
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,510
Look, dear, dolphins.

162
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:12,074
They seem happy.

163
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:14,808
I guess the chemical runoff
from this elitist beachfront property

164
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,282
hasn't rotted out their blowholes yet.

165
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:22,413
It will. That water will kill you.
It is a toxic deathtrap.

166
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:25,392
- I'm gonna take a dip.
- I'll join you.

167
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:28,888
Karen failed the front porch test.
She had to go.

168
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:31,328
I can't believe you did that.

169
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:34,699
Ted, think about how awesome
you, me and Marshall are.

170
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,238
Seriously, think about it.

171
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:43,376
- We're pretty awesome.
- We're totally awesome!

172
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:47,846
So whoever you marry,
whoever joins Team Awesome,

173
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:50,485
the bar is set pretty damn high.

174
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:53,789
Look, I'm not saying
what I did was right, but...

175
00:08:53,892 --> 00:08:55,086
You're better off without her.

176
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:57,923
And if Clarence the angel says it's true,
it must be true.

177
00:08:58,063 --> 00:09:00,429
Okay, you know what?
Fine, make your little jokes.

178
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:02,090
Seriously, why would you wear
something like that?

179
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,931
- Lots of reasons.
- I bet you can't name five.

180
00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:06,972
One, no need to wear anything underneath.

181
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:09,132
I can vouch for that.
Will you cross your legs, buddy?

182
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:11,072
Two, sexy.

183
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:14,636
I can vouch for that.
Will you uncross your legs, buddy?

184
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:18,744
Three, my grandpa Olaf wore one,
and he lived to be 107.

185
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:22,515
Four, no elastic waistband leaving
its judgmental pink teeth marks

186
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:23,783
around my Thanksgiving belly.

187
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:29,228
And five, every night
when I go to sleep, it's the freest,

188
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,331
<i>most wonderful feeling in the world.</i>

189
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:34,834
<i>I feel like I'm flying.</i>

190
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:42,335
<i>So that's how I go to bed every night,</i>

191
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:45,738
happy, weightless, with a heart full of joy.

192
00:09:45,849 --> 00:09:47,111
What about you?

193
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:52,152
I have to lie perfectly still
so I don't wrinkle my suit-jamas.

194
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:55,784
But at least I'm not wearing a dress.

195
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:59,625
So, how mad are you?

196
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,460
I don't know. I mean,

197
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,625
I guess if you guys feel that strongly
about Karen,

198
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,261
then maybe it was for the best.

199
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,862
I really am sorry.

200
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:11,465
I hated doing that again,
but Karen had to go.

201
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:16,939
Again? Wait. How many times have
you broken me up with a girlfriend?

202
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,847
Never! Six.

203
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,682
- Like who?
- No one! Angie.

204
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,354
Sophomore year.

205
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:29,259
She was just using you to get back
at her ex, and you clearly didn't see it,

206
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,862
<i>so one day when she was taking a nap...</i>

207
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,112
Creed?

208
00:10:50,286 --> 00:10:53,016
Oh, my God, I have to break up with her.

209
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,354
So that's where my Creed CD went.

210
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:58,189
Who else?

211
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:00,422
Remember that weird sci-fi girl

212
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:03,523
who wanted you to propose after,
like, two months?

213
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:07,331
You barely even liked her,
but you were still thinking about it, so...

214
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:14,341
<i>Listen, Ted, you're great,
and this is so difficult,</i>

215
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:17,407
<i>but I think we're looking
for different things.</i>

216
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:21,543
<i>So, live long and prosper. Whatever.</i>

217
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:29,858
That was you? This is insane!

218
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:34,127
Ted, I did those things to help you.
You're a commitment junkie.

219
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:37,567
You fall in love with these women
even if they don't deserve you.

220
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:40,232
What if one of those women was
supposed to be the mother of my children?

221
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:44,107
If there was ever the tiniest chance
of that, I swear I didn't do anything.

222
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:48,546
- Like with Victoria or Stella.
- Or Robin.

223
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:53,147
- Or Robin.
- Robin, Robin...

224
00:11:53,388 --> 00:11:55,686
Did you break us up, too?

225
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,116
Did you break us up, too?

226
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:00,822
Stop talking to me like I'm your enemy!

227
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:02,431
You weep for these women,

228
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:05,933
but you have the luxury
of not knowing what I know,

229
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:07,935
that those breakups, while tragic,

230
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:12,031
probably saved you from a crappy
and very expensive first marriage.

231
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:13,974
Did you break me and Robin up?

232
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:16,342
You don't want the truth
because deep down,

233
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:18,608
you want me out there
watching out for you.

234
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:21,413
And deep down, you know
that none of those women

235
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,784
were ever gonna
be the mother of your children.

236
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:26,153
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- I did what I had to do.

237
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:29,785
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- You're damn right I did!

238
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,625
Marshall, your grandpa Olaf
was a wise man.

239
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,602
You broke me and Robin up?

240
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:46,474
- No, it's not...
- I cannot believe this.

241
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,343
I need another drink.

242
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:50,880
You know, I feel a little breeze down there.
It's nice.

243
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,318
You think that's something?
Stand over this heating vent.

244
00:12:54,422 --> 00:12:57,357
It's like your junk is on a tropical island.

245
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:01,092
<i>- Little Barney says, "Mahalo. "
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

246
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,829
Seriously, what is wrong with you, Lily?
How could you do that?

247
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:07,027
I did this because I care about you!

248
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:10,537
I am so glad that is the one you watched!

249
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,938
Dear God, what happened to you?

250
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,601
You didn't watch my show?

251
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:20,182
Oh! The show. Sorry.
Something special happen?

252
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,745
Same old same-old.

253
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,585
Lily just told us that
she broke you and me up.

254
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:30,786
What? Broke us up?
What does that even mean?

255
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,625
And why are these guys
wearing nightgowns?

256
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:33,698
- Nightshirt.
- Nightshirt.

257
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,198
- It's a nightshirt.
- It's called a nightshirt, Robin.

258
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,791
Turns out Lily has taken it upon herself
to sabotage

259
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:39,734
many of my relationships, including ours.

260
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:41,601
No. Robin was different.

261
00:13:41,707 --> 00:13:43,369
I didn't want you two to break up,

262
00:13:43,476 --> 00:13:48,470
but you wanted completely different things
out of life and refused to deal with it.

263
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:50,913
I could just picture that front porch.

264
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:53,050
Hmm. Two of hearts.

265
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:55,553
Just like the hearts of the two children
I never had

266
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:58,056
because my lovely wife hates kids.

267
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:00,924
Mmm, a deuce.

268
00:14:01,028 --> 00:14:02,928
Exactly what my career dropped

269
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,864
once I decided to settle down
and marry Ted.

270
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:09,035
Bridge! I win.

271
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:13,204
Well, I do not like that scenario one bit.

272
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:16,836
All I tried to do was get you guys
to talk about your issues.

273
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:21,246
<i>I didn't know I was feeding you the words
that would lead to your breakup.</i>

274
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,650
Hey, here's a fun question, just for fun.

275
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:27,423
Where do you see yourself in five years?

276
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:30,884
You know what's fun? Fun questions.

277
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:33,656
Where do you see yourself in five years?

278
00:14:33,964 --> 00:14:37,366
- Where do you see yourself in five years?
- Where do you see yourself?

279
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:41,666
Not to put words in your mouth,
but you probably want to be married.

280
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,667
I probably want to be married.

281
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:46,835
You probably want to be in Tokyo or Paris.

282
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:50,379
I probably want to be in Argentina.

283
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:53,542
- Argentina?
- Or Tokyo or Paris.

284
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:56,454
We have an expiration date, don't we?

285
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:58,718
- Oh, my God.
- Lily,

286
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:01,555
you can't manipulate people like that!

287
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:03,526
I've known you 12 years,
and I can honestly say,

288
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,462
I have never been more furious at you!

289
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:08,160
- Look, I didn't mean to... I was just...
- No! I don't even want to hear it!

290
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,429
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

291
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:13,439
Settle down! Let's just settle down!
Now, I have one question.

292
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:17,744
- What do these bad boys feel like in bed?
- Come on. Let's go see.

293
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:21,473
So, if it weren't for you,
Ted and I might still be dating?

294
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,346
Or you would have stayed
together far too long,

295
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:28,254
had an incredibly bitter breakup
and not even remained friends,

296
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:31,589
and then you and I would never
have become best friends.

297
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:34,686
Don't even say that. Okay?

298
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:36,364
Stop hugging!

299
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:40,563
Lily, you had no right
to interfere in my relationships.

300
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:41,831
You got lucky. Okay?

301
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:45,067
You met the love of your life
in a dorm hallway when you were 18.

302
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,939
But that doesn't give you
the right to play God

303
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:50,378
to the rest of us mortals down here
who are still looking for someone.

304
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,609
You're so concerned about
who you and Marshall are gonna end up

305
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:55,481
on that front porch with.
Well, you know what?

306
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,681
You can have it to yourselves.

307
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,557
What happened to your jacket?

308
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,258
Soot, bread crumbs, placenta.

309
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,765
Did you at least TiVo it?

310
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,075
So, you're this comfy every night,
and Lily still has sex with you?

311
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,473
Yeah. That's what marriage is all about,
man, unconditional love.

312
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,708
You can wear whatever you want
and still get laid.

313
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:25,312
Tell me more about being married.

314
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,181
Well, sometimes, when you're married,

315
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,425
you wake up to the smell of
breakfast already on the table.

316
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:33,859
- And coffee, too?
- And coffee, too.

317
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:38,692
Sometimes, she'll even put out
a vase of freshly cut flowers.

318
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:40,292
I love flowers.

319
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:43,165
And sometimes,

320
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:45,571
when you're worried you've made
all the wrong decisions in life,

321
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:49,669
and you're not nearly the man you
want to be, what does she do then?

322
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,580
Well, she tells you that you're great
and it's all gonna be okay.

323
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:56,118
That's wonderful.

324
00:16:57,054 --> 00:17:01,185
And she'll help you find other girls
to have sex with?

325
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:05,257
I mean, I guess.

326
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:08,457
Maybe if you agreed
upon that beforehand, yeah.

327
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:10,124
Mmm.

328
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:12,363
Little guy had a big day.

329
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:16,267
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Sweet dreams, slugger.

330
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,854
<i>The next night,
I was still angry at your aunt Lily.</i>

331
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:35,156
<i>Until...</i>

332
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,528
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you...

333
00:17:41,737 --> 00:17:44,228
Lily came by and explained everything.

334
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:46,941
And she gave me this note for you.

335
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:52,738
<i>"Ted, I'm sorry.</i>

336
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:55,281
<i>"It doesn't matter to me who you marry.</i>

337
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:59,151
<i>"I know they'll be awesome
because they'll think you are.</i>

338
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,750
<i>"To show I mean it, I put together
a little surprise for you and Karen upstairs.</i>

339
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:05,089
<i>"Love, Lily. "</i>

340
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,858
<i>"P.S. Sorry the envelope
was already open.</i>

341
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,935
<i>"I had to read what she wrote. Marshall. "</i>

342
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,432
Sabotaging our relationship? I got to say,

343
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,236
even using the specially-ordered,
extra-low bar

344
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:18,775
by which I judge your friends,

345
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:20,936
Lily really outdid herself this time.

346
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:23,345
Obviously, we can't ever see her again.

347
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:26,551
I know. It's a big loss, right?

348
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:33,325
Hey, remember
your old college roommate?

349
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:36,988
He was married to
that shrill, little idiot girl.

350
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:41,261
Marshall. Oh, it's been so long.

351
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:43,166
God, I hated him.

352
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:45,698
Anyway, here's his obituary.

353
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:51,808
And I realized, maybe it shouldn't matter
what my friends think of my girlfriend,

354
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:55,315
but it sure as hell matters what
my girlfriend thinks of my friends.

355
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:58,785
- Wow. So you ended it?
- Yeah.

356
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:04,158
So if you want to be my plus one,
Lily's a damn good cook.

357
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:05,523
Mmm!

358
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:09,793
Beef pot pie, mac and cheese,
homemade buttermilk biscuits.

359
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,893
Wow, no wonder Marshall dies at 68.

360
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:15,798
Thank you.

361
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:18,534
<i>So, Robin and I
enjoyed a gourmet dinner.</i>

362
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,573
<i>Well, for her it was breakfast.</i>

363
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:24,308
<i>And we ended up doing exactly what
Lily wanted us to do all along,</i>

364
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,350
<i>we talked about our relationship.</i>

365
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:31,816
- So, Lily broke us up, sort of.
- Yeah.

366
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:35,622
- Kind of makes you wonder.
- Yeah.

367
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:40,457
I mean, if it weren't for her,
would we still be dating right now?

368
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:42,066
Maybe.

369
00:19:43,503 --> 00:19:46,564
But Lily was right. We weren't ready.

370
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:49,707
We both needed to move on,
do our own thing.

371
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:53,009
- Still do, I guess.
- Mmm-hmm.

372
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,414
We should make a pact.

373
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:59,721
If the years go by, and we both turn 40,

374
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,584
and we're still single, we...

375
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:12,200
Robin Scherbatsky,
will you be my backup wife?

376
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:15,735
A girl always dreams
of hearing those words.

377
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,831
Yes! Yes! A million times, yes!

378
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:25,442
Thank you.

379
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,449
- All right, it's a deal.
- Yeah.

380
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:31,915
So, should we set up
some ground rules for this?

381
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,012
Okay, like what?

382
00:20:33,124 --> 00:20:35,685
I don't know. Like neither one of us
can get super fat. Stuff like that.

383
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:38,059
Okay, I only have one,
you can't wear a nightshirt.

384
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:41,099
- I will never wear a nightshirt.
- Thank God.

385
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:00,277
Never mind.

386
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:02,116
No!
