20
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,120
Naughty thought.

21
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,430
How about we don't wait 12 minutes for our next kiss?

22
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,990
We would never see the end of the movie.

23
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,240
It's better if we stick to the schedule.

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,480
Sure.

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,630
Didn't hear you come in last night.

26
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,370
So I'm guessing it went well at Carly's.

27
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,010
The end of the movie was very predictable.

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,020
Not the question I was asking,

29
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,610
but you still managed to answer it.

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,120
Carly touches me when we kiss.

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,330
You don't like her touching you?

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,480
Oh, I -- I do.

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,730
But I prefer to touch only one thing at a time.

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,040
Have you told her you prefer to touch only one thing at a time?

35
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,330
In those exact words?

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,560
Whatever it is, I'm definitely in.

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,880
My first lead surgery!

38
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,720
Shaun! That is awesome!

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,290
I am going to rock it!

40
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,650
Oh, hells to the yeah you are!

41
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,500
How you doing?

42
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,500
I'm good.

43
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,670
Thank you for helping me with the sea lions.

44
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,960
I'll never say no to a caper.

45
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,440
But I'd like to keep my mother's death between the two of us.

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,360
I just -- I can't deal with people's platitudes right now.

47
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,040
Okay, but that kinda suggests you're not good.

48
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,390
This is textbook denial.

49
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,360
It's only going to inhibit your grief process.

50
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,330
Denial is the first step in the grief process,

51
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,620
so I'd say I'm right on track.

52
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,760
But thank you for your platitudes.

53
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,600
This is Curtis.

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,030
He decided to fix his chimney without a safety harness.

55
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,790
He has open bilateral tib-fib fractures.

56
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,030
They wanted $1,200 for a two-hour job.

57
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,480
And I can still do a Hurricane Grind.

58
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,290
It's a skateboard move that builds off a 180 Ollie.

59
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,690
I got great balance.

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,180
Pupils are slow to react.

61
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,590
Unfortunately, balance is less great after a few cocktails.

62
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,410
Not me.

63
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,570
Clean and sober six years, three months,

64
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,710
and -- and 24 days.

65
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,080
Get him on IV antibiotics and to OR Level One.

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,420
And run a BAC.

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,210
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

68
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,780
Your surgeon.

69
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,130
Esophageal cancer is a serious condition.

70
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,620
However, you don't have any remote

71
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,250
or metastatic disease

72
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,080
and responded well to chemoradiation,

73
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,640
so a resection of the esophagus

74
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,800
should render you cancer-free.

75
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,610
You look awfully young.

76
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,430
I always say, the younger they are, the smarter they must be.

77
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,130
Oh, oh, yes.

78
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,200
We will pull the stomach up and attach it to the remains

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,780
of your esophagus, keeping your GI system connected,

80
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,100
so you will not need a permanent feeding tube.

81
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,600
My oncologist told me all this,

82
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,580
but I refused to believe it --

83
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,860
that it was all gonna be okay --

84
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,310
until I heard it from my surgeon.

85
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,850
I'm sorry, it's just...

86
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,160
I've been through a divorce and a career change...

87
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,700
and I finally bought my own cafe...

88
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,410
three days before I got my diagnosis.

89
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,660
And I thought it was a sign I was making a mistake.

90
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,330
But it was just the opposite.

91
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,790
I wasn't done.

92
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,070
Oh, I'm sorry...

93
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,360
I have to inform you of the risks of this procedure.

94
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,730
There is a 7% chance of heart and lung problems,

95
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,600
a 12% chance of infection, a 0.5% of death, among others.

96
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,650
Bring it, Dr. Murphy.

97
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,460
Shaun got very lucky.

98
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,160
Landed the world's most genial patient for his first case.

99
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,890
- Nice. - Of you.

100
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,580
You picked that patient for him --

101
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,090
I heard it was Park's chart before you stepped in.

102
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,780
Shaun's weakness is patient management.

103
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,240
You shouldn't be coddling him.

104
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,430
We challenge him too much, we lose him.

105
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,370
Murphy?

106
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,110
He perseveres. He's annoyingly resilient.

107
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,160
I agree that some failures don't seem to faze him at all.

108
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,330
But it's his lifelong dream.

109
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,430
So, yes, I think we could lose him.

110
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,650
I'll tough-love his ass next week.

111
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,660
Okay, Curtis, we're good to go.

112
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,100
Curtis, my God. Are you okay?

113
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,210
I'm thinking I should've gone with the contractor.

114
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,560
His thinking was impaired.

115
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,280
He had a blood alcohol level of .09.

116
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,790
Your test must be wrong.

117
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,260
You were quite inebriated when you came in.

118
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,180
That's impossible. Curtis doesn't drink.

119
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,390
We'll make a note of it in his chart.

120
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,290
We've got to get him to the O.R.

121
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,070
You play softball?

122
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,540
Uh, my junior year in high school,

123
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,710
I had an ERA of 2.95.

124
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,290
My wife's got an arm.

125
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,640
I can't believe you're my wife.

126
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,460
Till death do us part.

127
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,300
Yeah.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,710
Oh, you found Wally.

129
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,010
You have a name for it?

130
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,480
Yeah, he's my Walther PPK .32;

131
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,940
he and I go way back.

132
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,080
Is it loaded?

133
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,350
I mean, is this a problem?

134
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,360
'Cause I -- I just -- I keep it in my bedside table,

135
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,700
in my gun safe -- combination 7-3-5-9.

136
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,290
I'm not gonna remember that.

137
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,990
I don't want to remember that.

138
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,480
If we're gonna live together,

139
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,690
we're gonna need to make some compromises.

140
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,270
You nervous?

141
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,000
How badly are you freaking out?

142
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm not badly freaking out.

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,380
I've assisted in six esophageal resections,

144
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,980
all of which were free of complications.

145
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,830
So you're overdue for a blow-up.

146
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,110
Sorry.

147
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,150
I'm just a bit annoyed

148
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,990
'cause I had my hand on this case first,

149
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,650
and now I'm third out of four, at best.

150
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,750
But I'm happy for you.

151
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,200
Really.

152
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,820
I'm happy for me, too.

153
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,660
She has extensive scar tissue.

154
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,720
And it's plastered her stomach to her anterior abdominal wall.

155
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,160
I told her she wouldn't need a permanent feeding tube.

156
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,090
But she will.

157
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,390
We've got to tell a budding chef she'll never eat again.

158
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,780
How will she react?

159
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,900
Don't know.

160
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,390
Badly. But the specifics --

161
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,900
You should tell her.

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,940
She's your patient, it's your job.

163
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,990
I'm bad at patient communication.

164
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,800
If I make her very unhappy,

165
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,080
she may not want me to do the surgery.

166
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,470
If you're not willing to take that risk,

167
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,210
then you should hand the case over to Park.

168
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,590
No. I don't want to hand the case over to Dr. Park.

169
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,170
Park will tell Beth.

170
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,720
And, Shaun, it's still your surgery.

171
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,010
Drill.

172
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,190
Do you see his heart rhythm?

173
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,550
Rate controlled A-fib.

174
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,110
Wasn't on his record.

175
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,970
Ask his wife about it post-op.

176
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,100
Probably a symptom of binge drinking.

177
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,380
Which he'll lie to us about and she'll tell us she believes.

178
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,270
She's in denial?

179
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,270
You had surgery as a child.

180
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,430
As a baby. I don't even remember it.

181
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,060
There's considerable scar tissue --

182
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,040
more than we'd typically expect to find.

183
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,760
Which has affected our surgical plan.

184
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,770
How?

185
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,720
Dr. Murphy will field that question.

186
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,310
No, Dr. Lim s-said --

187
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,890
Proceed, Dr. Murphy.

188
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,170
Somebody please tell me.

189
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,470
We can't move your stomach up, so you will need a feeding tube.

190
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,660
For the rest of your life.

191
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,690
The good news is that this surgery is simpler,

192
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,260
so your recovery time will be shorter by three to five days.

193
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,330
Do any of you own a gun?

194
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,580
Is there someone you'd like "taken care of"?

195
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,580
I still have my service pistol.

196
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,540
I have a Sig P365.

197
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,710
Do any of you have, or have you ever had,

198
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,480
issues about it with your significant others?

199
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,790
After our son was born, my wife suddenly hated

200
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,810
having a firearm in the house.

201
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,550
And one night, I came home late to a...

202
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,360
PowerPoint presentation.

203
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,060
90 minutes of horrifying statistics.

204
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,240
Now it's in a locker at my gun range.

205
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,430
Lotta set up but I like that.

206
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,580
I had a boyfriend who felt very weird about me having a gun.

207
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,130
He wasn't big on logic,

208
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,160
so I took the emotional approach.

209
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,850
Told him it's not for the firepower,

210
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,820
it's for the confidence it gives me

211
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,710
as a woman when I carry it.

212
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,430
I lived with a guy who had a gun.

213
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,400
Had to use the nuclear option.

214
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,470
It goes or he goes.

215
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,640
It worked -- they both went.

216
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,330
Well, that's just wonderful.

217
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,850
I heard your news.

218
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,310
It's pretty exciting.

219
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,280
I jumped seven times.

220
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,970
How's the anxiety level?

221
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,290
Why do people keep asking me that?

222
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,920
Everyone has doubts, Shaun.

223
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,110
I'm excited.

224
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,950
You can be excited. And nervous.

225
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,780
Usually they go together.

226
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,200
Speaking of, uh, I'm sorry if I was a bit

227
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,420
too assertive last night.

228
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,350
Lea said it must be tricky for you.

229
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,850
So now Lea is also privy to

230
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,420
the intimacies of our intimacy?

231
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,200
- Great. - Yes.

232
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,100
Lea said to tell you

233
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,510
that I prefer to touch only thing at a time.

234
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,520
Located upper esophageal sphincter.

235
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,400
You have a good tumor margin -- resecting above or below?

236
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,490
Below.

237
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,770
Shaun gave the news to his patient after all.

238
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,970
Shaun did what I expected.

239
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,720
He upset her, but the news is upsetting.

240
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,800
She'll deal with it, he'll learn how to --

241
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,510
She wants him off the case.

242
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,120
- Shaun -- - No...

243
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,730
Shaun, I will find you another case.

244
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,430
This is my case.

245
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,090
I prepared for this case.

246
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,270
I don't want another case.

247
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,000
Dr. Murphy...

248
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,600
You're learning, Shaun.

249
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,350
That's what you do at a teaching hospital.

250
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,630
I'm learning, too.

251
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,550
Going from attending to Chief of Surgery

252
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,590
is...a big deal.

253
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,620
Every day, every decision, every mistake...

254
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,450
I learn something.

255
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,020
So do you.

256
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,910
No, I don't.

257
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,900
I have a developmental disorder.

258
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,010
- Come with me. - I'm waiting for my bus.

259
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,490
You can take a later one.

260
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,350
I'm sure I mentioned I was Chief?

261
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,270
Hi, Beth.

262
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,210
I'm sorry for what you're going through.

263
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,070
And Dr. Murphy's phrasing was unfortunate.

264
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,440
But there's been no deceit or negligence.

265
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,730
He's an excellent surgeon

266
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,850
who has my full confidence in the O.R.

267
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,310
And if you don't trust him, you don't trust me.

268
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,650
So, I would recommend

269
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,480
you have your surgery at a different hospital.

270
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,130
I can make arrangements.

271
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,190
However, if you reconsider, we can proceed as scheduled

272
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,960
first thing tomorrow morning.

273
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,330
If you don't want people to know your mother died,

274
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,030
stop acting like someone whose mother died.

275
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm gonna move on to the second stage of grief -- anger.

276
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,350
I'm not acting depressed.

277
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,060
No, you're acting bitchy.

278
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,380
But you're not a bitch, so that looks weird on you,

279
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,190
and people are gonna know something's up.

280
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,460
So, do you want me happier or sadder?

281
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,090
Let me know, because I'm really looking for your approval.

282
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,180
Bitchy...

283
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,640
You really think this guy's still on the wagon?

284
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,710
Just because he's a drunk doesn't mean he's not sick.

285
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,100
But all you can see is an addict married to an enabler,

286
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,840
so all roads lead to rum.

287
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,010
C'mon, that was cute.

288
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,130
No LV wall motion abnormalities.

289
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,950
No valvular disease or dysfunction.

290
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,110
Ruling out any structural cause for the arrhythmia.

291
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,970
You win. Congratulations.

292
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,400
How was your day?

293
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,610
Good, good.

294
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,160
Pensive.

295
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,320
I was thinking about your gun and why you need it --

296
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,360
- Oh, Aaron, I -- I don't -- - No, no, no.

297
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,890
I was an idiot and a guy, I get it.

298
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,180
You walking alone in a garage late at night,

299
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,990
you walking alone on the street late at night --

300
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,590
Or getting into my own car, or even my own house.

301
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,750
Exactly.

302
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,050
That's why I got you a surprise.

303
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,320
- Yeah? - Right outside the back door.

304
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,010
We have exactly 10 seconds to punch in the code

305
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,480
before S.E.A.L. Team Six arrives.

306
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,770
7-3-5-9.

307
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,140
Every door, every window,

308
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,590
every vent over 36 inches.

309
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,010
This is your security fob.

310
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,980
Works in all 48 contiguous states and Canada.

311
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,700
You have no idea how much extra comfort this is gonna give me.

312
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,570
Actually, I was hoping it would be

313
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,710
your primary source of comfort.

314
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,220
You were thinking that this would mean

315
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,140
I would give up my gun?

316
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,350
That's exactly what I was thinking.

317
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,090
Well, the first rule of security systems is redundancy.

318
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,290
By that logic, we should get a tank for the garage.

319
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,530
Aaron, it shouldn't matter why I want a gun --

320
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,440
whether it's because it makes me feel more secure,

321
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,110
or it was a memento of my dad's

322
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,700
or just because it's fun to shoot.

323
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,720
All that matters is I'm a grown-up,

324
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,650
and I'm responsible, and I want it.

325
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,500
You're ruining Shaun.

326
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,550
Maybe you got him over the hump of patient management,

327
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,410
but what about surgical management?

328
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,140
Taking charge of the O.R.,

329
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,470
keeping lines of communication open, everyone cooperating.

330
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,120
You're throwing him into the deep end,

331
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,610
and that's unfair to him.

332
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,200
Unless you plan to scrub in as a lifeguard.

333
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,760
He'll be fine.

334
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,970
You handpicked his surgical team?

335
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,360
You're ruining him.

336
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,150
The tests prove his arrhythmia is associated

337
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,390
with excessive ethanol consumption.

338
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,060
But there's no permanent damage

339
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,280
and his rhythm will return to normal

340
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,490
in the absence of any further drinking.

341
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,700
We met when we were 15.

342
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,610
I was first clarinet, he was second.

343
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,010
We were at a band festival in Anaheim when he found out

344
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,310
his parents died in a plane crash.

345
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,160
We grieved together and fell in love.

346
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,790
Then he started drinking.

347
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,050
It wasn't until I threatened to leave that he finally woke up.

348
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,100
The day he received his two-year recovery chip

349
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,230
was the day we got married.

350
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,230
The day he vowed to me,

351
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,510
and a church full of our family and friends,

352
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,770
that he would never drink again.

353
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,240
Our marriage is built on his sobriety.

354
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,080
I believe him.

355
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,400
Teal,

356
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,500
we ran the BAC three times,

357
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,940
and the results were consistent.

358
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,040
I believe in my husband.

359
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,200
I have to.

360
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,520
His BP is dropping.

361
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,490
Temp is normal.

362
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,220
Check for causes of shock.

363
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,940
Upper GI bleed -- need stat hematocrits and transfuse blood.

364
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,500
Surgery's the easy-peasy part.

365
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,530
You wanted this, enjoy it.

366
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,920
I can't.

367
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,390
If I get distracted, if I get upset --

368
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,420
If you do, Andrews has your back.

369
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,500
If Dr. Andrews has to take over, then I have failed.

370
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,900
I have failed, and I have endangered a patient's life,

371
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,910
and if I'm no good at the easy-peasy part,

372
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,070
then what part am I good at?

373
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,670
What do we do when we get all nutty like this?

374
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,340
Blow out the candles.

375
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,030
How many do you need?

376
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,810
Three.

377
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,780
Hey. I was looking for you.

378
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,130
Big day, huh?

379
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,300
How are your nerves holding up?

380
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,060
I'm not nervous.

381
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,470
Of course you're nervous. Everybody's nervous.

382
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,200
It just means that you care.

383
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,670
Being nervous means I feel inadequate and unprepared,

384
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,840
and if I am either of those things,

385
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,790
it doesn't matter whether I care or not.

386
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,430
You are more than adequate, and you're very prepared.

387
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,870
You remind me of a -- a young surgeon I knew once.

388
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,880
The day he got his first lead, he was thrilled,

389
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,880
but he was a mess, trying to remember a million things,

390
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,730
imagining a million things that could go wrong.

391
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,490
But then he remembered the birth process,

392
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,150
how moms are asked to pick a focal point,

393
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,970
let everything filter through that.

394
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,410
So, he chose the color orange to focus on.

395
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,460
This is the cap that he focused on,

396
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,990
and he got through it with flying colors.

397
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,990
Maybe it'll help.

398
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,790
Why do you have the young surgeon's cap?

399
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,540
I was being coy.

400
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
The young surgeon was me.

401
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,400
Konnichiwa.

402
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,420
That's Japanese for hello.

403
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,830
Konnichiwa. I have surgery in 42 minutes.

404
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,470
Which is why I'm here, to wish you luck.

405
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,910
I don't need luck.

406
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,250
Everyone needs luck.

407
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,550
That was a good luck kiss.

408
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,700
How can a kiss give you --

409
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,470
So was that.

410
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,030
I am feeling a bit lucky.

411
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,670
You know the thing that Lea told you to tell me?

412
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,640
Yes.

413
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,660
That was actually great advice.

414
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,210
It's important that we tell each other

415
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,850
exactly what we like and what we don't.

416
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,730
I also don't like pickles, sirens, anything wool--

417
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,350
I was thinking more in the romantic area.

418
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,070
And right now, we are not going to touch lips anymore.

419
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,260
Because there's something else I want you to touch.

420
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,030
So, what do you think?

421
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,510
You don't have any lumps.

422
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,900
Win-win.

423
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,720
Lab and imaging tests rule out Crohn's,

424
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,640
gastroenteritis, C-diff colitis,

425
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,240
and even H pylori.

426
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,910
Leaving bleeding ulcers.

427
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,120
Caused by alcohol abuse.

428
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,690
He needs to be on a proton pump inhibitor

429
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,920
and octreotide to prevent any further blood loss.

430
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,320
No.

431
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,970
He loves you.

432
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,220
That's why he hasn't been honest.

433
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,670
Doesn't make it right, but it's that same love

434
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,900
that kept you together through everything.

435
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,570
And it'll get you through this, too.

436
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,030
He's telling the truth.

437
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,810
We'll run more tests.

438
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,250
Your faith in your husband is impressive.

439
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,850
But it may have just killed him.

440
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
{\an1}BGM: I Fear the Nite by Dan Romer, Saul Simon MacWilliams

441
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,930
Ten blade, please.

442
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,830
Located lower end of esophageal lesion.

443
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,870
Linear cutting stapler.

444
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,060
Resecting the esophagus from the stomach...

445
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,850
I'm now at the upper end of the lesion.

446
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,590
Hemoclips.

447
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,780
Dr. Murphy?

448
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,000
No.

449
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,780
No...

450
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,150
What's the matter?

451
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,500
No, no, no...

452
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,520
Shaun, what are you seeing?

453
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,120
Can't -- can't do this!

454
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,260
What -- what can't you do?

455
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,920
- No! - Don't -- No.

456
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,270
No! No! No! No!

457
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,190
- Dr. Murphy! - No!!

458
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,490
Dr. Murphy!!

459
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,660
Go, go!

460
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,870
Page Dr. Lim. Keep her stable.

462
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,130
No. No. No.

463
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,120
Yur...

464
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,660
No.

465
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,200
No.

466
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,640
No. Yur...

467
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,460
What happened?

468
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,570
- No, no, no. - He lost it,

469
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,020
walked out mid-procedure.

470
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,280
Yuri...Yu--

471
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,430
- Yuri kucho saiken. - Shaun?

472
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,020
Yur-- Yuri -- Yur...

473
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,940
Okay, Park, take over the surgery.

474
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,340
No!

475
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,360
Dr. Park.

476
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,920
Y--

477
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,230
- No. - He obviously can't.

478
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,240
I don't think he lost it.

479
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,560
He was in complete charge of that room.

480
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,660
I don't think this is a meltdown.

481
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,080
He said he can't do it.

482
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,020
He said, "Can't do it." Maybe he meant we can't do it.

483
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,430
I think he's seeing something...

484
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,460
We have a patient open on the table.

485
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,730
Shaun, you have to tell us what you're seeing.

486
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,410
It's okay, Shaun.

487
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,990
Breathe.

488
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,780
That's it. Now slowly.

489
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,820
What are you thinking?

490
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,220
When...

491
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,690
Okay. When I examined the upper portion...

492
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,050
When I examined the upper portion,

493
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,000
there was a much larger area

494
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,860
of tumor-free esophagus than anticipated...

495
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,550
That's correct, but not nearly enough to reach the stomach.

496
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:41,070
But there is enough to accept a jejunum free flap,

497
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,290
using a portion of the small intestine

498
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,270
to replace the resected esophagus.

499
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,550
We don't do jejunum free flaps.

500
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,500
They do in Japan.

501
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,090
They do in Japan.

502
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,340
I've been studying their technique --

503
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,610
Yuri kucho saiken.

504
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,200
They have had great success.

505
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,440
It would mean Beth wouldn't need a feeding tube.

506
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,390
But...

507
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,360
it is v-very complex.

508
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,590
It's too complex for you to lead.

509
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,960
So you'll lose your case.

510
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,920
Yes...

511
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,180
I haven't done a transposition graft like that before.

512
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,730
Think you can walk us through it?

513
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,320
Yes.

514
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,950
I'll scrub in.

515
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,680
Stomach is perfect.

516
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,360
Check the duodenum.

517
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,550
The only way Teal will accept the treatment

518
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,810
is if we give her no room for denial.

519
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,020
Did you really believe what you said?

520
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,970
That their love is enough to get them through this?

521
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,490
Such BS, the belief that love is enough.

522
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,990
Even worse, it's corollary that a lack of love

523
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,220
is the real problem.

524
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,040
If only they had someone in their life

525
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,020
who had enough faith in them, had enough love for them,

526
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,140
they could've pulled through.

527
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,520
It's wrong and it's mean.

528
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,410
What's that?

529
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,210
Flush the area.

530
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,410
There's our bleed.

531
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,300
But it's not coming from an ulcer...

532
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,970
It's coming from a tumor.

533
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,960
It's obstructing his digestive tract.

534
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,940
I'm paging Melendez to the O.R.

535
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,760
- Okay. - Actually, I'm --I'm gonna need an extra shot.

536
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,010
Rough day?

537
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,470
Had to help out in the E.R. with an eight-year-old boy

538
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,570
who was accidentally shot by his sister.

539
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,850
He'll survive, but with brain damage.

540
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,760
That's horrible.

541
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,370
Yes, it is.

542
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,830
And quite coincidental.

543
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,350
Like so many other coincidences.

544
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,760
You know how many kids are shot every day in this country?

545
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,830
19.

546
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,930
You know you're three times more likely to be shot

547
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,660
if you have access - to guns than if you don't?

548
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,250
Here's another fact -- one in four women are victims

549
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,780
of violence at the hands of their intimate partner.

550
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,660
No, no, no. I'm not afraid of you.

551
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,130
This isn't about you.

552
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,190
Did something happen?

553
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,110
'Cause if it did, I want to know about it.

554
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,930
You figure something horrible must have happened to drive me

555
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,050
to such an irrational, fear-driven choice?

556
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,280
I'm sorry. Hi.

557
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,160
The ends of the harvested jejunum have been matched

558
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,290
for caliber size for the attachment sites.

559
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,950
You should begin proximal attachment at the neck incision,

560
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,430
using layer-to-layer technique on the esophagus

561
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:12,390
and microvascular anastomosis of the vessels.

562
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,440
You wanted to know when Dr. Semler

563
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,180
was heading to O.R. #3.

564
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,350
Dr. Park, scrub out and join Semler.

565
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,520
I-if it's all right, I'd rather stay here.

566
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,190
You're needed where you're needed.

567
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,510
Tumor is free.

568
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,290
Bag it, tag it, and get it to path.

569
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,850
Do you smell that?

570
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,880
Smells like a distillery.

571
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,920
But we know he couldn't have touched a drop

572
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,000
for at least 24 hours.

573
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,000
Final stitch is yours.

574
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,930
It's completely symbolic, but symbols can be powerful.

575
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,060
Easy-peasy.

576
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,860
You had something called Auto-Brewery Syndrome.

577
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,730
The tumor we found was blocking your intestinal tract.

578
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,220
So carbs weren't being digested,

579
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,300
they were being trapped and fermented.

580
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,000
Your stomach was actually creating its own alcohol.

581
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,610
You were drunk, but not from drinking.

582
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,200
With the removal of the tumor -- which was benign --

583
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,050
you're all good.

584
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,890
And the arrhythmia's gone, too.

585
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,110
I never doubted you.

586
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,360
Her faith in you saved your life.

587
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,390
Thank you.

588
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,070
I was so pissed when Lim kicked me out --

589
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,190
until I found Semler had an appendectomy waiting for me.

590
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,460
Got my first lead after all.

591
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,580
I'm happy for you. Really.

592
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,240
I'm happy for me, too.

593
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,030
You earned it.

594
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,760
And you'll get your chance again soon, Shaun.

595
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,210
So that's it? All's well that ends well?

596
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,530
Your surgeon walked out on his case.

597
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,210
That's your takeaway? That he failed?

598
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,580
A chef can eat.

599
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,150
Well, as a diagnostician,

600
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,140
he did something wonderful, but as a surgeon?

601
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,870
Yes, he failed.

602
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,640
We don't work alone, Marcus.

603
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,010
Every time we have a good outcome,

604
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,890
it's because everyone in the room did something right.

605
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,160
Shaun came up with the idea, Park got it out of him,

606
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,260
I approved the surgery, and you?

607
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,650
The only reason Shaun is working here

608
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,550
is because you believed in him.

609
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,220
Yay, team.

610
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,220
Are you still having a gun fight?

611
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,710
Second day of my marriage and we are at an impasse.

612
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,950
Tried the logical approach, I tried the emotional approach,

613
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,320
no compromise.

614
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,260
Only thing left is the nuclear option, which really sucks.

615
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,350
The thought of having a gun in my house makes me sick...

616
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,270
Has Debbie let you touch her breast?

617
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,430
What?

618
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,010
Has Debbie let you touch her breast?

619
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,960
Yeah.

620
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:28,010
Then you shouldn't worry about anything else.

621
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,690
I was wrong...

622
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,150
this time.

623
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:52,770
But 99.9% of cases, I would be right.

624
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,500
If -- if someone acts like an addict, lies like an addict,

625
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,230
smells like an addict, then they are an addict.

626
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,650
And just because we stumbled across

627
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,700
the one ridiculously fluky exception,

628
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,390
that isn't going to change my attitude moving forward.

629
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,580
I respect you, Claire.

630
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,000
Might even go as far as to say I like you.

631
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,490
And I know you're angry right now.

632
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,700
At your mother.

633
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,850
The world.

634
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,030
Yourself.

635
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,810
Eventually, that'll go away.

636
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,100
Or...at least some of it will.

637
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,880
But until then, giving up on that 0.1%

638
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,060
means giving up on something else.

639
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,750
Hope.

640
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,050
Hope...

641
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,390
killed my mother.

642
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,250
We need to talk.

643
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,210
About the 800-pound gun in the room.

644
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,590
I'm working on my compromise skills.

645
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,660
Okay.

646
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,830
Looks like your first lead surgery went well.

647
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,260
I didn't have a first lead surgery.

648
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,730
Yes. It went very well.

649
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,470
Can I check your other breast?
