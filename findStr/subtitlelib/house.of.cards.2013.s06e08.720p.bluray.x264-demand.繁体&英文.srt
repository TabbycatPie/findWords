道格·斯坦普給我發了條信息
Doug Stamper sent me that text,

50
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,530
他說這是你丈夫日記里的話
he said it comes from your husband's diary.

51
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,090
我該采訪你  還是他
who should I interview, you or him?

52
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,640
你已經懷孕26周了  總統女士
You're 26 weeks pregnant, Madam President.

53
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,550
臭婊子  是女孩
You fucking cunt. It's a girl.

54
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,520
她死后  副總統的位子空缺
After her death, with the vice presidency vacant,

55
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,330
我們的朋友布雷特·柯爾會成為總統
our friend Brett Cole will be president.

56
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,860
我們要讓她成為烈士
We'll make her a martyr.

57
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,870
我不在乎你  也不在乎你想要什么
I don't care about you or what you want.

58
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,760
但你確實在乎弗蘭克想要什么
But you do care what Frank wanted.

59
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,020
弗蘭克想讓她死
Frank wanted her dead.

60
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,440
我來找你了  克萊爾
I'm coming for you, Claire.

61
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,920
弗蘭克會怎么辦
What would Frank do?

62
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,210
她可懷著他的孩子呢
Given that she's carrying his child.

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,060
我一直承諾會告訴大家真相
I've always promised to tell you the truth.

64
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,250
公開透明是我做總統的基礎
Transparency is the cornerstone of my presidency.

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,230
秉持著這一精神
And in that spirit,

66
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,510
我必須把這些事告訴大家
I feel compelled to share the following.

67
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,170
幾周以來
For some weeks now,

68
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,160
司法部在調查幾項指控
the Justice Department has been investigating allegations

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,960
前總統  即我丈夫
that the former president, my husband,

70
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,880
故意在幾個州夸大了2016年選舉日的威脅
falsely inflated 2016 election day dangers in several states

71
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,310
可能對選舉結果造成了影響
that may have played a role in tipping the results.

72
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,250
大家可以想象  這一消息
This news, as you can imagine,

73
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,370
讓一個遺孀的心被烏云籠罩
has caused a widow's dark night of the soul.

74
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,000
總統女士
Madam President!

75
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,110
這里曾是我的辦公室
This used to be my office.

76
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,510
那是我的辦公桌
That was my desk.

77
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,580
沙發換了
The couch is different,

78
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,000
但我在這兒過夜的次數多得都數不過來了
but I slept here more nights than I care to remember.

79
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,330
安德伍德議員的辦公桌就在那里
Congressman Underwood's desk was right through there.

80
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,170
他從來不睡
He never slept.

81
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,810
永遠別扣最下面的扣子
Never button the bottom.

82
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,450
-總統女士  -莎拉  請講
- Madam President! - Sarah, yes.

83
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,460
女士  具體來說
Ma'am, to follow up.

84
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,370
您究竟準備采取何種行動
What specific action, if any, are you planning to take,

85
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,940
鑒于您丈夫已經...
since your husband is...

86
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,340
去世了
Dead.

87
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,110
可供考慮的選項有很多
Well, everything is on the table.

88
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,120
包括死后起訴
Up to and including a posthumous indictment.

89
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,880
-拉里  -但是  總統女士
- Larry. - But, Madam President,

90
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,340
如果要質疑選舉結果
if you're calling the election results into question,

91
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,140
那對您的總統之位意味著什么
what does that mean for your presidency?

92
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,300
總統是全國權力最大的職務
This is the highest office in the land.

93
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,650
公職是神圣的
Public service is a sacred privilege,

94
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,080
誰都不能凌駕于法律之上
and no one is above the law.

95
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,170
我孩子的父親不能  我也不能
Not the father of my child, not me.

96
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,980
馬可斯
Marcus.

97
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,700
有人提醒過您剛剛發表的這篇文章嗎
Were you given any warning about this article that just came out?

98
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,520
簡寧·斯克斯基寫的
By Janine Skorsky?

99
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,190
我不知道你指的是什么
I don't know what you're referring to.

100
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,210
是在您講話時發表的
It was posted as you were speaking.

101
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,640
標題是
The headline reads,

102
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,020
《前總統安德伍德將妻子剔出遺囑》
"Former President Underwood excluded his wife from his will."

103
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,140
可以評論一下嗎
Would you care to comment?

104
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,330
我還沒看過的東西  無法作出評論  謝謝
Well, I can't comment on what I haven't seen. Thank you.

105
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,310
文章中提到的線人是道格拉斯·斯坦普
The source named in the piece is Douglas Stamper.

106
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,050
二十多年前  自從道格拉斯
I have known Douglas

107
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,120
成為我丈夫的左右手  我就認識他了
since he became my husband's right hand man over 20 years ago.

108
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,040
他最近飽受折磨  這不是什么秘密
And it is no secret that he's been having a difficult time lately.

109
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,660
最主要的是情緒方面
Emotionally, above all else.

110
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,280
我幾個月前赦免他  是出于憐憫
And when I pardoned him months ago, it was based on compassion.

111
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,160
我同情他  真的
I feel for the man, I do.

112
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,780
但道格·斯坦普絕對無法引導我們發現真相
But Doug Stamper will never be the one to lead us to the truth.

113
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,630
"顯然  前總統在最后時刻手寫了遺囑
"The former president apparently handwrote an 11th hour will,

114
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,260
嚴格說來  是親筆遺囑
technically known as a holographic will,

115
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,170
其中提到將他的全部財產
with instructions that his entire estate

116
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,000
留給前幕僚長道格拉斯·斯坦普"
be left to his former Chief of Staff Douglas Stamper."

117
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,770
寫沒寫到具體內容
Does it say anything about what's in it?

118
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,760
"遺囑的細節尚未公布
"The specifics of the will are not yet public,

119
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,070
但在與斯坦普先生的獨家采訪中
but in an exclusive interview with Mr. Stamper,

120
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,910
他承諾他'很快就會'公開內容"
he promised to reveal the contents 'soon.'"

121
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,090
你可以走了
That'll be all for now.

122
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,740
聯系白宮顧問
Get White House counsel.

123
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,310
不  現在就給我的個人律師打電話
No, no, actually get my personal lawyer on the phone now.

124
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,160
是  女士  還有  格林助理局長來了
Yes, ma'am. And Assistant Director Green is here,

125
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,820
但他堅持要把他的...
but he insisted that his--

126
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,790
總統女士
Madam President.

127
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,850
容我介紹一下我妻子艾比還有我們的兒子杰克遜
Let me introduce you to my wife Abby and this is our son Jackson.

128
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,510
你們好
Hello.

129
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,780
艾比是您的粉絲  我們想跟您合張影
Abby's such a fan, we were hoping to take a picture.

130
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,800
沒問題
Of course.

131
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,860
我希望我的家人陪我一起來告知您
I wanted my family here with me when I let you know,

132
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,990
我要離開聯調局了
I'm leaving the Bureau.

133
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,670
我已經遞交了辭呈
I already submitted my letter of resignation.

134
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,470
納森  那怎么行呢
Nathan, we can't possibly accept that.

135
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,810
求您了  黑爾總統  我求您了
Please, President Hale. I'm begging you.

136
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,730
琳  請進來一下
Lynn, can you come in here, please?

137
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,450
納森  我們必須得單獨談談
Nathan, I insist we speak about this one-on-one.

138
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,330
讓我們單獨談會兒吧
Can you give us a moment?

139
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,040
很抱歉我在沙漠讓你失望了
I'm sorry I failed you as far as the desert,

140
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,430
但我做不下去了
but I can't do this anymore.

141
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,030
-納森  -我已經決定了
- Nathan-- - I've made up my mind.

142
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,010
如果我悄悄離職對我們都好
It's better for both of us if I go quietly.

143
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,480
我想你一定很期待第一天
I'm sure you're looking forward to walking Jackson

144
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,140
送杰克遜上學
to his first day of school.

145
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,700
是的  女士
I am, ma'am.

146
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,690
那我的想法沒改變
Well, my feelings haven't changed.

147
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,060
我希望道格能終于獲得
I want Doug to finally, finally get the help

148
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,730
他非常需要的幫助
he so desperately needs.

149
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,160
你有理由擔憂
You're right to be concerned.

150
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,300
這世上的確有些瘋狂的人
There are some crazy people out there.

151
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,860
我最后跟道格對話時
In my last conversation with Doug,

152
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,020
他告訴我有人找上了他
he told me entities had approached him,

153
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,250
想招募他  艾比
hoping to recruit him. Abby.

154
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,010
你最好取消你接下來的公開露面
You should cancel your upcoming public appearances.

155
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,960
-只是來見老朋友的  -總統說
- Here to see an old friend. - The president said,

156
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,200
"道格·斯坦普絕對無法引導我們發現真相"
 "Doug Stamper will never be the one to lead us to the truth."

157
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
你想評論嗎
You care to comment?

158
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,860
把我說成是瘋子肯定對總統有利
It must serve the president to paint me as some sort of crazy man.

159
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,500
但抱歉讓她失望了  我頭腦清醒  她很清楚
Bu I'm sorry to disappoint her, I am of right mind, and she knows it.

160
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,190
那份被修改的遺囑  誰知道其內容
In terms of a revised will, who knows about its contents?

161
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,750
這問題你怎么不去問她
Why don't you ask her that question?

162
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,530
先生  你是怎么知道的
Sir, how did you become aware of it?

163
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,510
他死的那晚我跟他在一起
I was with him the night he died.

164
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,490
他叫我去他在海亞當斯酒店的套間
He asked me to his suite at the Hay-Adams.

165
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,770
他說他不再相信
He told me he no longer had faith

166
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,770
他妻子能擔任總統了
in his wife's ability to serve as president.

167
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,570
安德伍德總統
And President Underwood,

168
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,600
真正的安德伍德總統留了音頻日記
the real President Underwood, kept an audio diary.

169
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,470
我已經聽了一些
Pieces of which I've heard.

170
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,410
那我們就找個能做出對我們有利判決的法庭
Then let's find a court that will rule in our favor.

171
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,510
斯坦普  前弗蘭西斯·安德伍德總統的幕僚長
...Stamper, former Chief of Staff to President Francis Underwood,

172
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,240
今天早些時候的言論
recorded earlier today.

173
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,510
我們請嘉賓們
Let's turn to our panel

174
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,170
談談他們怎么看待據稱...
for their take on the claim that the leak--

175
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,430
別忘了  他是個有困擾的人
...remember, this is a troubled man.

176
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,770
我們并不能完全相信他說的一切
We can't take everything he says at face value, right?

177
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,840
問題是  斯坦普究竟有何最終目的
The question is, what is Stamper's endgame here?

178
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,420
-為什么攻擊黑爾總統  -怎么
- Why the whole attack on President Hale... - What?

179
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,460
他是該去激怒她的
He was supposed to provoke her.

180
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,320
他被控謀殺  但最終被開釋
He walked away from murder charges.

181
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,600
-別忘了...  -馬克
- Don't forget that... - Mark...

182
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,680
-我沒時間讀你的心  -我提醒過你
- I don't have time to read your mind. - I tried to warn you.

183
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,670
我跟他合作過  我們有暴露的風險
I've worked with this guy. We could be exposed.

184
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,440
-你相信我嗎  我的直覺  -我當然信你
- Do you trust me, my instincts-- - Yes, of course I do.

185
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,840
但這跟評估他如今帶來的風險毫無關系
That has nothing to do with evaluating the risk he is becoming.

186
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,610
他精神錯亂  安奈特
He's unhinged, Annette.

187
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,770
要的就是精神錯亂
Unhinged is what's called for.

188
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,980
控制好他  那是你的工作
Contain him. That's your job.

189
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:47,760
安奈特
Annette!

190
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,780
怎么回事
What's going on?

191
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,190
如果我兒子不是我兒子  他早放出來了
If my son were anyone else in this country, he'd be out by now.

192
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,510
不  這算怎么回事
No, what's going on here?

193
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:04,970
我們之間嗎
Between us?

194
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,940
我們又開始做愛了
We're having sex again.

195
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,420
直到又再次對我們不利
Until it seems like a bad idea, again.

196
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,260
-聽我說  -那賤人
- Hey, listen to me-- - That bitch

197
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,050
在制造對鄧肯不利的局面
is tipping the scales when it comes to Duncan.

198
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,110
他是絕對得不到公正聽證會的
And there's no way he can get a fair hearing,

199
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,670
除非她死了
until she's gone.

200
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,520
好吧  等等
Okay, hold on. Just, um...

201
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,190
你可以退回去一點嗎
Can you back up a few words?

202
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,760
退多少
How far back?

203
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,450
"這種時刻  需要..."
"Moments like this require..."

204
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,500
什么來著
What is it?

205
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,020
"有人采取行動  做一些不好的事"
"Someone who will act. Who will do the unpleasant thing."

206
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,030
可以讓我聽嗎
You know what? Can you just let me hear it?

207
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,000
不行
No.

208
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,050
為什么
Why not?

209
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,400
我不能...
I can't. It's...

210
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,320
你干什么
What are you doing?

211
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,830
沒什么
Nothing, I-- Nothing.

212
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,620
我們不非得這么做的  好嗎
Look, we don't have to go ahead with this. Okay?

213
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,260
不管你需要理清楚什么  你該去理清
And whatever you need to figure out, you should.

214
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,070
你不能就放下他嗎
Like, can't you just leave him alone?

215
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,090
-你當我是什么  -我很清楚你是什么人
- What do you think I am? - Look, I know exactly what you are.

216
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,940
她會找上你的
She's gonna come after you.

217
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,740
"要有人采取行動
"Requires someone who will act.

218
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,270
做一些不好的事  但也是必要的事
Who will do the unpleasant thing, the necessary thing.

219
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,480
別被她美麗的臉騙了
Don't be fooled by her beautiful face.

220
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,960
我妻子很無情"
My wife is ruthless."

221
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,280
"是我認識的最無情的女人  可惜人們不知道"
"The most ruthless woman I've ever met. If people only knew."

222
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,570
我們已申請了禁止令
We've filed an injunction.

223
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,300
但斯克斯基稱她的消息源
But Skorsky's saying her source

224
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,010
認為這些材料是他的
believes the material belongs to him.

225
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,800
這簡直瘋了
This is insane.

226
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,720
除非有人拿出遺囑的證據  沒...
Unless someone produces evidence of a will, there's no--

227
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,170
我們為什么要把這事當真啊
Why are we even taking this seriously?

228
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,680
我相信我可以用噤聲令讓她閉嘴
I am confident I can silence her with a gag order.

229
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,190
但一旦新聞印發
But once a thing is in print,

230
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,130
-其他新聞機構都能...  -印發
- any other news outlet has the right to-- - Print?

231
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,400
這不是紙媒  杰柔丁
This isn't print, Geraldine.

232
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,720
我們不能關閉網站嗎
Can't we just shut down the site?

233
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,760
不能  女士  那恐怕不行
No, ma'am. I don't think we can.

234
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,680
我建議  我們取證
My advice, let's depose.

235
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,670
讓斯坦普先生宣誓
Get Mr. Stamper under oath.

236
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,090
-如果他作偽證  -不  那正中他下懷
- If he perjures himself-- - No. That's exactly what he wants.

237
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,910
他就想要公開的平臺
He wants a public forum.

238
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,650
而且他也受了不少罪了
And he's been through enough already.

239
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,740
總統女士  我得問
Madam President, I have to ask.

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,400
我也會在您律師面前提這個問題
And I will ask you this in front of your attorney.

241
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,490
您的立場
Is it your position

242
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,460
是你完全不知道你丈夫...
that you were entirely unaware of your husband's--

243
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,130
-這您不必回答  -不  我想回答
- You don't have to answer that. - No, no, I want to.

244
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,210
我不知道他那么做是為我還是為自己
I don't know if he did it for his sake or mine,

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,040
但他從未告訴我任何事
but he never told me a thing.

246
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,080
女士  在美國訴尼克松案中
Ma'am, in United States v. Nixon--

247
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,950
我以他未出世的孩子發誓
I swear on his unborn child.

248
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,300
當然了  公司的部分領域
Well, there's no doubt that there's areas of the company

249
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,620
她并不是很擅長
she's not quite as well versed in.

250
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,840
這我有責任
Partly my fault, our--

251
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,680
我們的父親不相信繼承
Our father didn't believe in succession.

252
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,140
你是說你覺得你妹妹無權...
Are you saying you don't think your sister deserves--

253
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,920
不是  我不是那個意思
No. That's not what I'm saying.

254
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,340
其實  說到繼承
If anything, when I talk about succession,

255
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,410
我想說的是總統之位
I'm talking about this presidency.

256
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,980
承認吧  我們的三軍統帥
Let's face it, our Commander In Chief,

257
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,520
基本上是從她丈夫那里繼承來了這工作
who basically inherited the job from her husband,

258
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,930
還擺出了一副女王的架勢
is acting like a goddamn monarch.

259
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,250
當
When--

260
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,910
當一名暴君假裝透明公開
When a tyrant pretends to be transparent,

261
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,320
國家就要小心了
nation beware.

262
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,170
這些
And these--

263
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,510
這些評論
These comments,

264
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,060
這些道格·斯坦普的公開評論  是完全說得通的
these public comments from Doug Stamper make nothing but sense.

265
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,020
去查串謀吧
I mean, follow the complicity.

266
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,230
-所以你對黑爾總統有什么建議嗎  -有
- So, do you have any advice for President Hale? - Yes.

267
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,070
退位
Abdicate.

268
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,450
-得了  比爾  -不  真的
- Oh. Come on now, Bill. - No, no. Listen

269
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,420
這對國家來說不會是壞事
it wouldn't be the worst thing for this country

270
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,500
如果她的任期提前結束的話
if she didn't finish out her term.

271
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,400
如果那是她的命運的話
If that's what was fated for her.

272
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,150
-謝潑德先生  -聽著
- Mr. Shepard-- - Listen,

273
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,340
我昨晚一個勁地調臺
I was flipping around the channels last night,

274
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,460
然后看到了《邊城英烈傳》
and I came across The Alamo.

275
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,010
我知道那不算部好電影
I know it's not a great movie,

276
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,120
但當約翰·韋恩哽咽著說"共和..."
but when John Wayne chokes up saying "Republic--

277
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,530
比爾·謝潑德  閉上嘴吧
Bill Shepherd, shut the fuck up.

278
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,890
聯系其他人
Reach out to the others.

279
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,800
提醒他們嘴巴不牢的危險
Remind them of the perils of loose lips.

280
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,370
納森·格林參加了一場安奈特·謝潑德主持的會議
Nathan Green was in a meeting hosted by Annette Shepherd.

281
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,970
我不輕易緊張
I don't get rattled easily,

282
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,280
但這件事的秘密性  去的人和為什么去
but the secrecy around this one, who was there and why,

283
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,640
這是我前所未見過的
is more than I have ever come across.

284
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,420
我猜那房間里坐了些很有勢力的人
I suspect there were some very powerful people in that room.

285
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,440
道格拉斯·斯坦普呢
Douglas Stamper?

286
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,580
我還不知道
I don't know yet.

287
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,250
還有別的嗎
Anything else?

288
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,720
沃爾特  你從一開始就跟我們合作
Walter, you have worked with us from the beginning.

289
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,380
是啊  我喜歡弗蘭克
Yes. I liked Frank.

290
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,370
所以我很好奇
So, I'm curious.

291
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,000
你怎么做到的
How did you pull it off?

292
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,430
克萊爾
Oh, Claire,

293
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,360
我的考慮很實際
my calling is a practical one.

294
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,910
我不評判  也不質疑
I don't judge. I don't question.

295
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,350
我只是為出價最高者工作
I simply work for the highest bidder.

296
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:49,040
我是不可知論者  但這虛擬界對我來說很陌生
I'm agnostic, but this virtual landscape is new to me.

297
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,780
而現在有人
And someone out there

298
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,110
在非常拼命地抹黑弗蘭克
is working very hard to make Frank look very bad.

299
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,290
聽著  現在的雜音很多
Listen, it's just a lot of noise at the moment.

300
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,120
不僅僅是他
It's not only about him.

301
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,270
你要怎么把自己撇干凈啊
How will you manage to separate yourself from all this shit?

302
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,700
現在能聯系到我的只剩道格了
All that's left is Doug to connect me.

303
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,430
小心  克萊爾
Be careful, Claire.

304
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,670
各位啊
Oh, you guys.

305
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,140
我其實真不希望還得這么做的  但是...
I really didn't wanna have to have to do this, but...

306
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,680
哈里發國恐怖組織的一個極端派系
An extreme faction of the ICO terrorist group

307
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,600
企圖在巴基斯坦購買一個核裝置
made an attempt to purchase a nuclear device in Pakistan.

308
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,700
這是事實
That's a fact.

309
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,430
-總統女士  無意冒犯  -瑪莉婭
- Madam President, all due respect-- - Maria,

310
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,490
我知道你是新來的
I know you're new to this,

311
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,920
但請再不要對我用那個俗語了
but please don't ever use that expression with me.

312
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,020
"無意冒犯"表達的是完全相反的意思
"All due respect" means precisely the opposite.

313
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,750
女士  這個威脅
Ma'am, it's just that this threat

314
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,730
仍是一個潛在威脅
remains squarely in the category of a potential--

315
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,270
但他們有意圖
The intent is there.

316
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,090
除非我們能確認交易...
Until we have confirmation that the deal has--

317
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,650
我們的情報機構已經表示
Our intelligence has told us

318
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,360
他們會重新部署  再次嘗試的
that they will regroup and try again.

319
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,140
這能追溯到拉菲克·納澤兩個月前的警告
This goes back to the warning from Rafiq Nasser two months ago.

320
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,080
自從南茜接替了諾拉
Now acting Secretary Gallagher and I

321
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,920
成為代理國土安全部部長
have been keeping a close watch on this threat

322
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,720
我們就一直在密切關注這一威脅
ever since Nancy took over for Nora at Homeland.

323
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,520
為了秉承本屆政府的
And in the spirit of the full transparency

324
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,740
公開透明政策
this administration is embracing,

325
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,370
我們要把這公諸于眾
we're going to take it public.

326
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,450
女士  老實說  我擔心
Ma'am. Frankly, I'm concerned.

327
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,620
從戰略角度講
From a strategic perspective,

328
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,070
如果哈里發國不行動  我們就成了狼來了
if ICO doesn't act, we appear to be crying wolf.

329
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,340
另一方面  我們要把局面搞成
But on the other hand, are we putting ourselves in a position

330
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,440
刺激他們行動嗎
where we're daring them to act?

331
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,840
我們不想魯莽行事
We don't want to appear reckless.

332
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,060
我昨晚睡不著
I couldn't sleep last night.

333
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,820
當然是因為國家安全的原因
For obvious national security reasons, of course,

334
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,680
但是
but...

335
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,410
也因為胎兒鬧得我睡不著
also because the baby kept me awake.

336
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,230
不知怎么
And for some reason...

337
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,440
我想到了"厭女者"一詞
the word "misogynist" popped into my mind.

338
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,580
我努力去想有沒有個對應詞
And I was trying to think of the word for the opposite.

339
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,890
就是討厭男人的專有名詞
You know, the word for when a person hates men.

340
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,700
在場有誰知道那個詞是什么嗎
Does anyone around this table know that word is?

341
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,420
就是討厭男人的專有名詞
The word for when a person hates men?

342
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,830
有人知道嗎
Anybody?

343
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,760
我還去查了一下
I had to go and look it up.

344
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,640
"厭男者"
"Misandrist."

345
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,940
但沒人知道這個詞
And no one really knows that word

346
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,100
因為我們文化中不常用它
because it's not used in our culture.

347
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,520
所以我想說的是  或許我們都
So what I'm getting at, is maybe we all,

348
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,040
不管我們什么性別
regardless of our gender,

349
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,540
應該好好審視一下我們關于誰能
would do well to examine the pre-conceived notions that we have

350
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,240
誰不能做三軍統帥的既定想法
about who can and cannot act as Commander In Chief.

351
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,500
給
There you go.

352
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,480
這家店叫聯邦黨豬
They're from a place called the Federalist Pig.

353
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,740
我沒聽說過
I don't know it.

354
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,810
據說是僅次于弗萊迪的烤肉了
Well, I've been told it is the next best thing to Freddy's.

355
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,050
我不用了  你要點嗎
I'm good. You want some?

356
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,700
不  給你買的
No, they're for you.

357
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,960
道爾在到處打聽你
Doyle has been asking around about you.

358
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,430
我們可以讓他停止
Now we can shut him down.

359
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,820
但是
But...

360
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,390
來吧  給我一根
Yeah, come on, give me one. I mean...

361
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
什么樣的人拒絕肋排啊
What kind of man says no to ribs, right?

362
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,290
報道  還有記者招待會
The articles and the press conferences.

363
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,100
雖然不多  但影響很大  道格
A little goes a long way, Doug.

364
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,820
很多人
A lot of people,

365
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,180
可以說整個國家
in a way, the whole country,

366
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,980
-都在指望你  -賽斯
- we're relying on you. - Seth,

367
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,190
我能照顧好自己
I can take care of myself.

368
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,580
可以把醬遞給我嗎
Can you pass that sauce?

369
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,360
你肯定很孤獨
You must be so alone.

370
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,840
你身邊還有值得信任的人嗎
Do you even have anyone around anymore that you can trust?

371
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,210
你在玩什么把戲
What are you playing at?

372
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,930
"她肯定都看見了  所有的殺戮
"Surely, she saw it all. The killing.

373
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,070
相關的謊言"  弗蘭克在第六分鐘說
The lying," Says Frank at minute six.

374
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,670
道格  你和我必須和解
Doug, you and me have to have a come to Jesus.

375
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,130
同意  停止公開指責他  否則就等著被曝光
Agreed. Stop publicly accusing him or it's all gonna come down.

376
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,030
我現在只想尋求事實
All I'm trying to do is seek the truth these days.

377
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,220
76分鐘  "我有大行動前
Minute 76-- "Before I ever made any big moves,

378
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,270
總先跟我妻子商量"
I always ran them by my wife."

379
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:09,010
我喜歡你的聲音  道格  很安撫人心
I like the sound of your voice, Doug. It's so soothing.

380
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,210
我以前從沒想過這個
I never really thought about it before,

381
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,730
但在這方面  你讓我覺得像弗蘭西斯
but in just this way, you remind me of Francis.

382
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,170
我真正想念的  是他的聲音
The one thing I really miss is his voice.

383
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,720
那一直是我最喜歡他的地方
It was always my favorite thing about him.

384
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,090
不管他說的是什么
No matter what he would say,

385
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,380
他的聲音讓我覺得好像
the sound of his voice made me feel like

386
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,350
一切都會沒事
everything was going to be all right.

387
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,590
不是的
It's not.

388
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,920
除了安奈特  還有誰去了
Besides Annette, who else was there?

389
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,610
只有我能救你  道格
I'm the only one who can save you, Doug.

390
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,510
"他又問我是否不信上帝
"And then he asked if I had no faith in God.

391
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,030
我說  你錯了
I said, 'You have it wrong.

392
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,980
是上帝不信我們"
It's God who has no faith in us.'"

393
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,740
14分鐘  要我給你放嗎
Minute 14. Would you like me to play it for you?

394
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,040
放棄調查  為你對他的抹黑道歉
Drop the investigation and apologize for what you're doing to him

395
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,740
否則就會有更多泄露出來
or more of this is gonna come out.

396
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,740
我要按播放了  我想要你聽聽
I'm gonna press play. I want you to hear it.

397
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,540
我的安全團隊剛告訴我
My security team just informed me

398
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,600
俄羅斯士兵沖美軍特種部隊開槍了  維克多
that Russian soldiers are firing at American Special Forces, Viktor.

399
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,980
是他們入侵了海岸
They invaded the coast,

400
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,690
這違反了你我的協議
which violates agreements you and I made.

401
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,110
是為了防止核裝置
Preventing a nuclear device from--

402
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,860
這是你策劃的嗎  克萊爾
Did you orchestrate this, Claire?

403
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,000
為了什么  分散人們對你丈夫日記的注意
For what? To distract from your husband's diary?

404
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,190
別裝作你不會做出這種事
And don't act like that would be beneath you.

405
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,370
我并不相信當母親能自動讓一個女人變成圣人
I don't believe motherhood automatically makes a woman a saint.

406
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,440
-拉菲克·納澤  -死了
- Rafiq Nasser-- - Is dead.

407
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,800
我們一小時前用無人機襲擊了他
We hit him with a drone strike an hour ago.

408
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,880
他在給我們提供必要的情報
He was providing us with necessary intelligence.

409
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,710
那是你先告訴他的
That you provided him with first.

410
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,260
威脅是真的
The threat is real.

411
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,930
我會讓我格勒烏的人接手的
I'll have my people, the GRU, take it from here.

412
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,130
不行
No, you won't.

413
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,550
克萊爾
Look, Claire, just...

414
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,060
專心生你的孩子去吧
worry about having your baby now.

415
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,930
我一直覺得你的自大很好玩
I've always been entertained by your arrogance.

416
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,100
就像是看已經過了時的電影
It's like watching some movie, just out of date.

417
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,780
如果有危險分子拿到核武器  維克多
If a rogue element gets their hands on a nuclear device, Viktor,

418
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,230
我會先出擊的
I will strike first.

419
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,790
你們那邊現在幾點
What time is it there now?

420
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,490
快日出了吧
Must be close to sunrise, huh?

421
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,340
快了
Just about.

422
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,260
如果你丟原子彈
If you drop an atom bomb,

423
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,590
我們的世界  你女兒的世界
our world, your daughter's world...

424
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,050
太陽會永遠變樣的  克萊爾
That sun will never look the same again, Claire.

425
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,990
你那邊幾點了
What time is it there?

426
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,480
我正要吃午飯
I'm about to have lunch.

427
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,010
你都吃什么
And what are you having?

428
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,780
沙拉
Oh, a salad.

429
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,800
黃瓜和西紅柿  還有羊乳酪
Cucumbers and tomatoes, a bit of feta.

430
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,620
西班牙橄欖  還有丹吉爾的草藥
Some Spanish olive oil and herbs from Tangiers.

431
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,700
我現在不吃面包了
I don't eat bread anymore, you know.

432
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,290
我們還從未好好吃過一頓飯
We never had a proper meal, you and I.

433
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,410
算不上吃過
Not really.

434
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,610
我現在得在聯合國公開反對你了
I'll have to oppose you now, openly at the UN.

435
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,540
事事針對你
And at every turn.

436
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,130
但私下里
Privately, I...

437
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,060
我會想你的
I will miss you.

438
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,640
我已跟佩特羅夫總統說明
As I made clear to President Petrov,

439
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,120
我絕不會允許恐怖分子帶著原子彈
I will not have terrorists waltzing out of the desert

440
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,650
大搖大擺地走出沙漠
with an atomic bomb.

441
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,150
我也該拿你們當大人了
It's time for me to treat you all like the adults you are.

442
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,310
事實就是
The truth is...

443
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,380
我不是唯一有危險的人
I'm not the only one who's in danger.

444
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,630
沒有人真正安全
No one's safe. Not really.

445
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,020
永遠都不
Not ever.

446
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,360
那么會進行核打擊嗎  自長崎后的第一例
Does that mean a nuclear strike? The first one since Nagasaki?

447
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,400
如果有必要的話  是的
If need be, yes.

448
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,300
泰芮
Terry.

449
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,060
你近來公開批評總統
You've become a vocal critic of the president.

450
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,950
甚至在你被捕前
Even before your arrest.

451
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,970
其實  你第一次公開露面
Actually, the first time you went public

452
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,980
就是支持限制她權力的立法
was to support legislation limiting her powers.

453
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,590
而現在這一點更加緊急了
Which is now more urgent than ever.

454
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,200
最近  在你等待庭審時
And recently, as you await trial,

455
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,850
又因為一些言論而陷入了更多麻煩
you got into some more hot water with your comments.

456
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,820
是啊  我失言了
Yes, I misspoke.

457
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,290
但說實話吧  這個總統簡直要命
But let's face it. This president is fatal.

458
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,930
她在刺激末日的到來
I mean, she's out there evoking end of days.

459
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,680
她在任的話
And with her in office,

460
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,240
國家就是會走向末日
that is exactly where this country is headed.

461
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,610
我是什么
And what am I?

462
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,640
因為我還相信家庭  就古板了嗎
Some antiquated soul because I still believe in family?

463
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,450
如果你想改變國家的貧困狀態
Listen, if you want to do something in this country about poverty,

464
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,760
就得靠家庭
family.

465
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,620
減少犯罪  靠家庭
Crime, family.

466
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,130
教育  靠家庭  家庭是一切
Education, family. It's family.

467
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,170
我父母每晚都六點吃飯
My parents had dinner at six o'clock. Every single night.

468
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,080
不管你在哪  在做什么
They didn't care where you were, what the hell you were doing.

469
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,280
晚飯六點開始
Dinner was at six, goddamnit.

470
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,750
你和你妹妹上一次一起吃晚飯是什么時候了
And when's the last time you and your sister had dinner?

471
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,580
這個問題很合理
That is a fair question.

472
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,520
我們的確
And it has been some time

473
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,940
挺久沒有面對面坐下來了
since we sat across from each other.

474
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,840
你好嗎  比爾
How you doing, Bill?

475
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,800
看是哪天了
Depends on the day.

476
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,690
還有用藥劑量
And the dose.

477
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:12,640
我給你帶了點心來  喬治敦的普蓬
I brought you some pastries, from Poupon, Georgetown.

478
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,100
我知道你就喜歡這個
I know you have a soft spot for those.

479
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,970
我現在不吃糖了
Well, I don't do sugar anymore.

480
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,720
只會助長腫瘤
It's... fuel for the tumor.

481
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,430
你想吃的話吃一個吧
You can have one, if you want.

482
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,790
不用了
No, I'm good.

483
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,780
20年前
Twenty years ago,

484
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,800
我大概會坐下來
I probably would have sat down...

485
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,010
寫本回憶錄
and written out my memoirs,

486
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,650
而不是
instead of...

487
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,160
想盡辦法把話說出去
trying to just get it out there any way I can.

488
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,990
我以為她會來呢
I thought she would have come out.

489
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,960
抱歉  她讓我來了
I'm sorry. She sent me.

490
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,680
她要我停下嗎
Does she want me to stop?

491
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,710
恰恰相反
The opposite.

492
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,390
她要你繼續猛烈抨擊總統
She wants you to keep hitting the president hard...

493
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,380
這樣她就能出來反對你
so that she can come out against you.

494
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,480
這會變得一團亂嗎
Is this gonna be a mess?

495
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,400
可能吧
Could be.

496
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,200
什么時候變成這樣的
When did it happen?

497
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,010
我們成了拼命補救的一方
That we were the ones catching up.

498
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,690
是我們沒留神嗎
Were we not paying attention?

499
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,290
不夠留神
Not enough.

500
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,250
弗蘭西斯就是個混蛋
Francis was a son of a bitch.

501
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,780
但他是個厲害的混蛋
But he was a talented son of a bitch.

502
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,140
他料到了她
He saw her coming.

503
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,510
卻阻止不了他自己
He just couldn't stop himself.

504
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,730
或她
Or her.

505
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,250
你覺得十年后我們會變成什么樣  馬克
Where do you think we're gonna be in ten years, Mark?

506
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,850
拜托  這個問題我逢人便問
Come on. I'm asking everybody.

507
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,600
-因為顯而易見的原因  -你比我更常想這個
- For obvious reasons. - You think about it more than I do.

508
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,670
大腹便便  醉眼迷離  心不在焉
Fat, wasted and distracted.

509
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,520
這么過一晚還不錯  但不能這么生活
Might be a good night out, but it's no way to live a life.

510
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,430
拜托  十年后
Come on, ten years?

511
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,670
我不知道
I don't know.

512
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,060
事情并不會怎么改變  比爾
Things don't really change, Bill.

513
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:44,870
只會...
They just--

514
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,920
只會逐漸消逝  兄弟
They just fade away, man.

515
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,390
天啊  我真憤怒
God, I'm angry.

516
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,870
我聽了你丈夫的錄音
I heard your husband's voice.

517
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,770
道格拉斯·斯坦普來找我們
Douglas Stamper came to us.

518
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,700
要把弗蘭西斯的日記給我們
Offered up Francis' diaries,

519
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,550
道格給我放了部分片段
snippets of which Doug played for me.

520
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,340
說實話  我想過拿它對付你
And to tell you the truth, I considered using it against you.

521
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,240
但我覺得錄音
But I don't think it should

522
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,500
不應該被公開
ever find its way into the public sphere.

523
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,280
-我很驚訝  -我不是我哥哥
- Forgive my surprise. - I'm not my brother.

524
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,710
比爾現在對民主是不利的
Bill's become bad for democracy.

525
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,280
和之前的弗蘭西斯一樣
Like Francis was.

526
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,690
大家都喜歡看女生打架
The world loves a cat fight,

527
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,900
但我說我們不要如他們的愿
but I say let's deny them the satisfaction.

528
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,160
對我們來說還不算太遲
It's not too late for us.

529
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,870
你說得對  我們不要讓他們如愿
You know, you're right. Let's not give them what they want.

530
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,720
去他們的
Fuck them all.

531
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,910
抱歉  寶貝
Sorry, Angel.

532
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:01,010
他們是能聽到聲音的  有這方面的研究
They hear things, you know. There have been studies.

533
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,570
感覺是不是很棒
Is it amazing?

534
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,210
是的
It is.

535
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,210
她是個活潑的小東西
She's an active little thing.

536
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,540
我可以摸摸嗎
May I?

537
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,640
當然可以
Sure.

538
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,200
她在踢我
She's kicking.

539
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,810
我們會解決掉道格的
We'll take care of Doug.

540
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,700
我不相信你會支持我
I don't believe your support.

541
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,200
你根本不會說謊  安妮
You're a bad liar, Annie.

542
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,870
你還企圖殺了她
And you tried to kill her.

543
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,610
你手里有我兒子
You have my son.

544
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,900
你準備怎么下手
How are you gonna do it?

545
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,520
我不知道你在說什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

546
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,000
告訴我其他人是誰  我就放了鄧肯
Tell me who the others are and I will let Duncan go.

547
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,370
-他是無辜的  和我一樣  -天啊  得了
- He's innocent, as am I. - God, please.

548
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,910
這所謂的核危機
This so-called nuclear crisis.

549
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,590
你比弗蘭克還糟糕
You're worse than Frank.

550
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,720
她又在踢我了
She's kicking again.

551
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,000
像是她感覺到  結局就快到了
It's like she senses we're nearing the end.

552
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,310
唯一的問題是  道格
The only question, Doug, is

553
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,110
如果你是他們的A計劃  那他們的B計劃是什么
if you're their plan A, what's their plan B?

554
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,380
如果弗蘭西斯還在  我們就能知道
If Francis were here, we'd know.

555
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,280
是啊  如果他準備殺我
Yes. Well, if he was going to kill me,

556
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,980
-他會怎么做  -他會利用你提供的機會
- how would he do it? - He'd find an opportunity you provided.

557
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,940
他總是搶先人三步  是吧
He was always three steps ahead, wasn't he?

558
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,140
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德...
Francis Underwood...

559
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,560
也許他現在還是這樣
Maybe he still is.

560
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,890
我一直在延續他的生命嗎
Have I been keeping him alive?

561
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,650
我愿意走到哪一步
Just how far am I willing to go?

562
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,270
我有些猶豫了
I'm having second thoughts.

563
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,840
我確定這是個好主意嗎
Am I sure this is a good idea?

564
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,170
是的
Yes.

565
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,810
如果我懷的是惡魔的種呢
What if I'm carrying a demon seed or something?

566
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,950
五五開的幾率
The odds are 50-50.

567
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,600
真是受夠了說弗蘭西斯的事
So tired of talking about Francis.

568
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,210
我想念我男朋友里德
I miss my boyfriend Reed.

569
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,840
我有時候也想  但...
I do too, sometimes, but--

570
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,150
里德想要的太多
Reed wanted too much.

571
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,130
弗蘭西斯允許我保持饑餓
Francis gave me permission to hunger.

572
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,830
因為他也是這樣
Because he felt it himself.

573
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,690
一直都不滿足
All the time. Insatiable.

574
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,070
大家都覺得我應該知足了
Everyone thinks I should feel sated.

575
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,730
而他說  "不  克萊爾
Then he said, "No, Claire,

576
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,940
和我一樣饑餓  永不滿足"
be as hungry as me."

577
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,560
于是我吞噬了他
And so I ate him?

578
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,680
他吞噬了自己
He ate himself.

579
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,530
道格·斯坦普呢
Doug Stamper?

580
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,870
我也要吞噬他嗎
Am I going to eat him?

581
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,960
-上帝先生  -魔鬼先生
- Herr God. - Herr Lucifer.

582
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,280
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}出自《拉撒路夫人》一詩

583
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,130
當心了
Beware.

584
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,690
我一直以為
You know, I always thought...

585
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,960
-或許某一天...  -放回去
- maybe one day, you know, but... - Put it back.

586
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,460
什么
What?

587
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,950
那張照片  貼回冰箱上
The picture. It belongs on the fridge.

588
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,490
好  抱歉
Okay, sorry.

589
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,590
如果有什么我可以做的
You know, if there is anything that I can do.

590
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,290
萬一沒能如我們的愿
I mean, in case it doesn't go as planned.

591
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,700
能別晃來晃去嗎
Can you please stop moving?

592
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,370
我有點緊張  好嗎
I'm a little worked up, all right?

593
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,680
克萊爾·黑爾·安德伍德生而后死
Claire Hale Underwood lived and then she died.

594
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,420
-她也只是凡人  -沒錯
- She's no different from anyone else. - Yeah.

595
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,970
我不敢說世人會和你持相同的看法
Well, I'm not sure the world's gonna see it the way you do.

596
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,420
如果一切順利  你將成為英雄
If this breaks right, you can be a hero.

597
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,420
別拍馬屁了  賽斯
Don't spin me, Seth.

598
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,350
他們打算怎么處理我
How do they plan to do me in?

599
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,530
賽斯
Seth?

600
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,390
聽著
Look.

601
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,920
我這么說
I'm gonna say this to you.

602
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,190
并不是因為我們是朋友
Not because we're friends.

603
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,550
而是因為我們一起經歷的一切
But because of everything that we've been through together.

604
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,480
你是個混賬
You're an asshole.

605
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,350
你如果不想做  可以退出
You don't have to be a part of this, if you don't want to.

606
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,290
你這么說是為了我  還是為了自己
You saying that for me or for you?

607
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:33,970
或許都是
Maybe both.

608
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,530
我不清楚是誰
I don't know who it is...

609
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,970
但他們在白宮有內應
but they have someone inside the White House.

610
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,460
軍方一向看她不順眼
Military always hated her.

611
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,020
那是一點
That's one thing.

612
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,340
去他們的
Fuck 'em all.

613
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,570
我們倆就遠走高飛吧
What about the two of us? We just leave.

614
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,910
你想去哪里
Where do you wanna go?

615
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,810
喂
Hello.

616
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,470
他看起來如何
How does he look?

617
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,600
挺好  他肯定她會邀請他去
He's fine. He's sure that she'll invite him in.

618
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,870
讓他接電話
Put him on.

619
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,720
道格
Doug.

620
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,630
嗯
Yeah.

621
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,170
多么偉大的時刻
What extraordinary times these are.

622
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,780
我真希望能親自握你的手
I wish I could be there to shake your hand.

623
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,960
安奈特  有件事我必須講明
Annette, I want to make something very clear.

624
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,130
我這么做不是為了你
I'm not doing this for you.

625
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,900
我們一定會把他從加夫尼遷到阿靈頓公墓
We'll be sure to move him from Gaffney to Arlington.

626
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,660
并且資助圖書館
And help fund the Library.

627
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,140
道格  考慮到你近期的精神狀態
And, Doug, given your recent struggles,

628
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,900
九年十年后  你就能出來了
nine or ten years from now, you could be out.

629
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,740
我要感謝你
And I want to thank you.

630
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,230
賽斯
Seth.

631
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,560
是
Yes.

632
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,240
這邊已經準備就緒
Everything is set from our side.

633
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,930
只差臨門一腳了
The quarterback is standing by.

634
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,420
鄧肯呢
And Duncan?

635
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,300
他只能等了
Is going to have to wait.

636
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,760
她還說了什么
What else did she say?

637
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,340
沒了
Nothing.

638
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,080
就...
Just...

639
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,680
一切都準備好了
everything's in place.

640
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,440
再見
Later.

641
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,280
賽斯
Seth.

642
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,550
事情發展不會如你所想的
It's not going to go like you think.

643
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,300
不
No.

644
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,240
我從來就不喜歡對你說話
I never liked talking to you in the first place.

645
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,250
據我得到消息
From what I hear,

646
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,420
你取消公開露面是對的
you were right to cancel your public appearances.

647
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,620
-你這么認為  -是的  女士
- You think so? - I do, ma'am.

648
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,600
我認為你目前待在白宮里
I think the White House is the safest place

649
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,840
是最安全的
for you to be right now.

650
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:16,000
納森  你是個騙子
Nathan, you're a liar.

651
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:20,930
幫我個忙  替我親吻你小寶寶的額頭
Do me a favor. Kiss your sweet baby's forehead for me.

652
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,510
我們的情報已證實
Our intelligence confirms

653
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,960
交易馬上就要進行了
the hand off is on the verge of taking place.

654
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,960
但我們的情報顯示并非如此
And our intelligence says that's not so.

655
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,740
這可是一片半徑20英里的沙地
We're talking about a 20-mile radius of sand.

656
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,500
無法通過常規辦法到達
Unreachable by conventional means.

657
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,370
我會讓我的部隊配合你的部隊  好嗎
I'll have my forces coordinate with yours, okay?

658
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,430
我沒在請求準許  維克多
I'm not asking for your permission, Viktor.

659
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,260
克萊爾  我能看出你多么渴望讓敵人知道
Look, Claire. I can see how eager you are to show your enemies

660
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,380
你有多強大
just how powerful you are.

661
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,290
但是  拜托
But, please,

662
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,640
不要這樣做
please don't do this.

663
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,030
我了解你
I know you,

664
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,290
知道你做過的事
the things you've done.

665
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,270
想想世界會如何評價你
Think how the world will judge you.

666
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,320
就好像你在世界舞臺上有什么可信度似的
As if you have any credibility with the world stage.

667
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,350
準備一份聲明
Prepare a statement.

668
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,710
女士  我必須反對
Ma'am, I need to object.

669
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,670
你說什么
Pardon me?

670
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,670
民眾知道我們準備進行核打擊了
The public is aware we're prepared to strike.

671
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,800
我們不需要讓他們更加恐慌了
We don't need to alarm them further.

672
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,910
我不要參與這出戲
I will not be a part of this... this fabrication.

673
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,990
通知軍隊副官
Alert the military aide.

674
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,340
我要他準備好核公文包等著我
I want him ready and waiting with the briefcase.

675
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,130
一次針對性的打擊將使該地區
A targeted strike will destabilize the region

676
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,580
動蕩幾十年
for decades to come...

677
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,320
還會在歐洲
and it will create a distrust

678
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,940
和亞洲大部分地區產生不信任感
that will ripple through Europe and much of Asia.

679
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,930
市場將受到震蕩  是的  后果會很嚴重
Markets will be rocked. Yes, the consequences will be grave.

680
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,080
但我已經得知
But it has come to my attention...

681
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,150
現在有針對我的陰謀
that there is a plot against me.

682
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,670
我的白宮里有人打算背叛我
Someone in my White House is planning to betray me.

683
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,280
在我找出內鬼之前
And until I find out who that is,

684
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,950
我不會重新考慮我的立場
I will not reconsider my position here.

685
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,870
女士  道格·斯坦普給您送來了一樣東西
Ma'am? Something arrived for you from Doug Stamper.

686
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,370
它通過了安檢
It was passed through security.

687
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:18,840
謝謝
Thank you.

688
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,500
說
Yes.

689
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,500
軍人不支持你
The men in uniform don't support you.

690
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,910
把白宮清場
I want the White House emptied out.

691
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,460
除了你們  只留下必要的最少人手
Other than yourselves, minimal and essential staff only.

692
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,990
-所有來訪者都要經過我的同意  -是  女士
- All visitors need to be cleared by me. - Yes, ma'am.

693
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,140
你在開玩笑嗎  你要放我鴿子嗎
Are you fucking kidding me? Are you standing me up?

694
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,530
上帝保佑你
God bless you, man.

695
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,820
但你不是這樣答應我的
But this is not what you promised me.

696
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,510
你可以告訴總統
And you can tell the president

697
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,630
她可以派一幫律師對付我
that she can send an army of lawyers at me,

698
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,670
但別想埋了我
but I won't be buried.

699
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,790
我不會罷休的
I am not going to stop.

700
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,470
我不知道在什么時候以何種方式
And I don't know when it will be or how.

701
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,940
但我一定會完成這該死的報道  好嗎
But I am going to finish this godforsaken story, okay?

702
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,190
看  哈利·布洛克的畫  這是我最喜歡的
See, the Harry Brooker painting, that's my very favorite.

703
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,380
然后是霍格斯
And then there's the Hogarth.

704
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,670
18世紀  英國的
That's 1700's, English.

705
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,580
還有法國的  夏爾丹  同一時期
And from France, the Chardin, same period.

706
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,720
紙牌屋

707
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,070
還有一幅...
There's...

708
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:14,500
19世紀  德國的
one from the 1800s from Germany

709
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,340
這個很有趣
that's very interesting in here.

710
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,960
在這里  看到了嗎
There, see?

711
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,260
它們都有一個共同點
They all have one thing in common.

712
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,760

Children watching,

713
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,850

我不要在這兒等著
I won't be here for this.

717
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:53,790
那你想去哪里
Where would you rather be?

718
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:54,870
我不知道

但我又去不了  所以我不知道
But I can't be there, so I don't know.

722
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,130
如果你要離開  就快走
If you're leaving, leave.

723
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:41,570
女士
Ma'am.

724
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,000
謝謝你  弗洛拉上校
Thank you, Colonel Flora.

725
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,760

726
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,890
-女士  我沒有...  -閉嘴

727
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:50,460
你怎么這么久才來
What took you so long?

728
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,200
能讓我們單獨談談嗎
May we have the room, please?

要喝一杯嗎
Do we need a drink?

732
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:14,870
你不能喝酒
You can't.

733
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,870
畢竟是非常時刻  是吧
Well, desperate times, right?

734
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,090
這些是想殺了你的人
Here's who wants you dead.

有個瑞秋·波斯納  不過

你覺得那件事  你還能逃避多久

743
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,040
我逃不了
I don't.

744
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,080

還沒定
I haven't decided yet.

那是給她的
That belongs to her.

749
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,550
她會聽到他的聲音  他的話嗎
She ever gonna get to hear his voice? His words?

750
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,220
不會
No.

751
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,680
也永遠不會有人聽到了
And neither is anyone else.

752
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,020
-她父親是個偉人  克萊爾  -道格
- Her father was a great man, Claire. - Doug.

753
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,430
他在這些錄音里  有多少次
How many times did he even mention your name

754
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:48,800
提到過你的名字
in those recordings?

755
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,020
-他是在保護我  -不是
- He was protecting me. - No.

756
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:57,370
你非要這么認為  我很遺憾

了解你的人  只剩下我了  克萊爾

你利用這個孩子

裝出一副國母的樣子
acting like the mother of this nation.

761
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,390
-但我知道真相  -道格  我很幸福

他過來是想殺了你
He was coming here to kill you.

766
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,370
然后下一個目標就是你

00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:49,250
我不能讓你毀了他
I couldn't let you destroy him.

768
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:55,510
你是想讓他死在我床上  你是這么計劃的嗎

我哪有什么計劃
I didn't have a plan.

00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,890
我根本不知道
I didn't know.

771
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,840
我真的不知道
I didn't-- I didn't know.

772
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,350
我用了他的藥
I used his meds.

773
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,370
我不知道要花多久才生效  但是我

我不能讓他毀掉我們成就的一切

776

我必須阻止他破壞他的遺產
I had to protect the legacy from the man.

777
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,400
他變弱了  道格

778
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,140
這不是你的錯

我不會如你所愿的

可惡  克萊爾  說吧  求你了

00:53:08,120 --> 00:54:08,120
{\an5}{\pos(193,147)}2013年美版《紙牌屋》第一季上線  隨后在當年的艾美獎上獲得9項提名
成為美國電視史上第一部獲得艾美獎提名的網絡劇  在過去5年中
《紙牌屋》共獲得46項艾美獎提名和8項金球獎提名  包括最佳劇集
男女主演凱文·史派西和羅賓·萊特都曾憑在本劇中的表演獲得過金球獎
但與其它經典美劇不同的是  《紙牌屋》的成功
深深影響了美國娛樂工業在21世紀的發展  其歷史地位遠超一部普通電視劇
網飛當年冒著巨大風險  投資1億美元制作了《紙牌屋》第一季
進入了自主制作內容的領域  并破天荒地采取一次性整季上線的發行方式
由于編導演俱佳  該劇上線后非常成功  網飛也加大了原創劇方面的投入
到2018年  其在自主內容制作上的投資預算已經達到了驚人的130億美元
在2018年的艾美獎上  網飛超過HBO獲得了112項提名  并最終奪得23個獎項
《紙牌屋》第六季上線前幾天  網飛還宣布了一項新的發行政策
其自主制作的幾部優質影片上線前  將先在一些線下影院放映
該政策是為了讓這幾部佳作能夠有資格參加明年的奧斯卡最佳影片競爭

00:54:08,120 --> 00:55:08,120
{\an5}{\pos(193,147)}《紙牌屋》的成功和網飛的飛速擴張  徹底改變了全球劇迷觀看視頻節目的習慣
也讓美國娛樂工業發生了滄海桑田般的變化
亞馬遜  Hulu  甚至蘋果等公司開始投巨資進入自主制作在線視頻內容的領域
HBO  STARZ  ShowTime等有線付費頻道也隨之加大投入  改變制作發行方式
迪士尼收購20世紀福克斯  試圖推出自己的在線付費服務等
都很大程度上是為了應對網飛的競爭威脅
《紙牌屋》2013年第一季上線時  網飛的付費用戶是三千六百萬
到2018年  網飛在全球一百多個國家提供服務  用戶總數達到一億三千七百萬
現在每天全球互聯網有15%的流量是在播放網飛的劇集
網飛也從一家在線視頻網站  發展成了全球最大的娛樂媒體公司
但元老劇集《紙牌屋》卻漸漸失去了曾經的光環
最后幾季很少獲得獎項肯定  粉絲口碑也有所下降  除了劇集本身的質量問題
《紙牌屋》的降溫  還因為美國所有政治劇創作者都面臨的一個巨大挑戰：
現實生活中的美國政治越來越離譜  美劇的內容還不如電視新聞精彩
美國政壇亂象的夸張離譜  讓美劇編劇們只能自嘆不如
