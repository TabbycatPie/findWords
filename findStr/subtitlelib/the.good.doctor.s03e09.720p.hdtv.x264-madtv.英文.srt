Kinda overcooked the eggs.

You know, I outdrank you at least two to one.

Never mind I was rolling on Molly.

33
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,290
I'm a cheap date.

34
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,570

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,310
I had fun last night.

41
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,760
Me too.

42
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,070

Hey, Shaun --

53
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,990
I have a question for Dr. Glassman.

54
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,500
Uh, he's, uh, in the shower.

55
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,820
- Do you want to come on -- - When did his shower begin?

56
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,580
Just -- He just got in.

57
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,160
His showers are at least nine minutes.

58
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,420
I'd be late to work.

59
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,150
I'll wait. This is important.

Is there something I can help with?

64
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,190
The florist told me the pink roses express passion

65
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,880
and the purple Peruvian lilies convey devotion,

66
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,710
but I feel both passion and devotion for Carly.

67
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,500
You could give her both.

68
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,320
Please ask Dr. Glassman to text me the answer

69
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,400
as soon as he gets out of the shower.

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Well...what's Carly's favorite color?

71
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,720
'Cause flowers don't really have meaning.

72
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,700
That's just a tactic to boost sales.

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,220

92
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,610
39-year-old male, multi-car accident,

93
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,690
blunt abdominal injuries,

94
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,740
including ruptured spleen and lacerated liver.

95
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,370
- What's his G.C.S.? - Nine.

96
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,670
Intraperitoneal free fluid in the right upper quadrant.

97
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,700
We need an O.R., stat.

98
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,760
Page Melendez.

101
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,300
We were at our engagement photoshoot.

102
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,210
I thought it was just a migraine.

103
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,450
I get them sometimes with the flashing lights.

104
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,060
Then she started slurring her words.

105
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,420
I was trying to tell him

106
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,880
that I couldn't feel or move my left side.

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,460
The only thing that got me through was Tony telling me,

108
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,190
"Okay, it will be."

109
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,900
How long before your symptoms began to subside?

110
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,550
About half an hour.

111
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,300
By the time we got here, all I had was a mild headache.

112
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,500
I think you had a transient ischemic attack.

113
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,530
A mini-stroke.

114
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,190
- A stroke? - Mini.

115
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,540
Jeanie's 25.

116
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,370
Which is why we'll need an MRI, cardiac echo, and labs

117
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,040
before... we know for sure.

118
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,260
Cauterize that bleed.

119
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:44,970
That's it for the liver.

120
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,570
What's his mean arterial pressure?

121
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,940
67.

122
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,770
What was that place with the deviled oysters you took Dr. Lim to?

123
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,760
Oh, Mia's in town.

124
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,050
As some of you may be aware,

125
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,900
Dr. Lim and I are no longer together.

126
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,690
It's called Half Shell.

127
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,190
Downtown, off Second.

128
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,820
Remove the packing.

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,900
Look at the aorta.

130
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,820
Likely a laceration from the accident.

131
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,990
We'll need to dissect further to determine the extent of the damage.

132
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,520
B.P.'s skyrocketing.

133
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,930
He's just suffered massive blood loss.

134
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,970
He's under anesthesia. He should be hypotensive.

135
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,970
Pulmonary embolism?

136
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,910
Push beta-blockers.

137
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,490
That-- that'd kill him.

138
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,880
He's tachycardic and hyperthermic.

139
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,680
I think he must be on something.

140
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,710
MDMA mixed with anesthesia?

141
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,300
Give him a low dose of nitroglycerin

142
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,790
and calcium channel blockers.

143
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,100
B.P.'s dropping.

144
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,110
It's working.

145
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,540
Push the full dose. Close him up.

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,490
We're gonna have to wait for the MDMA to leave his bloodstream.

147
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,810
We'll get a better look at the aorta via imaging.

148
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,310
Good call.

149
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,630
I need to use the restroom.

150
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,450
Hang in there, Jeanie. Just a couple more minutes.

151
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,570
You should ask me what I'm going to do tonight.

152
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,890
Okay.

153
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,000
But just to make it feel more like an actual conversation...

154
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,710
Nothing much.

155
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,750
I've got a yoga class and a date with Ben & Jerry tonight.

156
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,640
How about you, Shaun?

157
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,330
I'm having sex with Carly.

158
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,510
It's my first time.

159
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,170
Mazel tov.

160
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,050
It took us 22 days to kiss,

161
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,320
nine more to hold hands --

162
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,950
although, we don't really hold hands when we hold hands --

163
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,150
and another six to touch more than one thing at a time.

164
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,350
But now I'm ready.

165
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,560
That's a lot of foreplay.

166
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,690
I've been reading about the four stages of arousal --

167
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,580
Fair warning -- - the first time for most people

168
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,930
is kind of awful.

169
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,140
Your first time was awful?

170
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,040
Not an appropriate question to ask a colleague.

171
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,230
Although, there's an exception to every rule.

172
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,890
Which books did your lover read to prepare?

173
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,650
No clots, no bleeds, 

174
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,730
no occlusions, no P.F.O.

175
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,670
W--

176
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,100
She didn't have a stroke.

177
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,940
She's having a seizure.

179
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,390
Pushing diazepam.

180
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,030
She had to use the restroom.

181
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,610
Her bladder is distended.

182
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,820
Whatever it's pressing against must be causing these attacks.

183
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,230
CT shows she has two pelvic lesions,

184
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,830
and labs show elevated levels of catecholamines.

185
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,250
The pain meds we gave her could have distended her bladder,

186
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,550
which is abutting one of the tumors,

187
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,390
setting off her second attack.

188
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,880
But what set off the first one?

189
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,380
Sexual intercourse.

190
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,200
The other tumor appears to be within her clitoris.

191
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,300
Progressive impact may have destabilized it over time.

192
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,490
And now she's at risk of having more seizures.

193
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,210
Sex could kill this woman.

194
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,830
He's stable, and the MDMA is out of his system.

195
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,950
We're good to go back in and graft the aorta.

196
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,190
We're just getting caught up with blood loss

197
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,540
and fluid resuscitation.

198
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,300
An endovascular stent is minimally invasive.

199
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,830
It is a better option than a graft.

200
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,780
But a stent could clot off

201
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,610
because we won't be able to give blood thinners.

202
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,250
His liver is still a bleeding risk.

203
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,910
Let's take our chances with the stent.

204
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,560
We can be in and out and have him back in the ICU,

205
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,350
where we can focus on his recovery.

206
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,830
I do not want to proceed without consent.

207
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,700
He won't regain consciousness for another couple of hours.

208
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,120
We shouldn't wait that long.

209
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,850
Get it from his wife. She's on her way here now.

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,940
We can remove the tumors,

211
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,190
but it means we also have to remove

212
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,100
most of your vagina and clitoris.

213
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,700
You can still have children.

214
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,150
Via C-section. It won't affect your uterus or ovaries.

215
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,490
What about sex?

216
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,500
You won't be able to have intercourse

217
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,400
or experience an orgasm.

218
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,310
I-it doesn't make sense.

219
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,560
I've been sexually active for five years.

220
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,120
Never had any attacks.

221
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,170
We suspect the tumor's been dormant for some time.

222
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,800
What if I don't have the surgery?

223
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,080
What are the odds of another attack?

224
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,280
There are many variables involved,

225
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,400
including frequency, duration,

226
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,600
sexual position, penis size --

227
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,970
About 2%.

228
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,190
Each time?

229
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,330
Each time.

230
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,280
On average, couples have sex 52 times per year,

231
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,010
which means in the next three years,

232
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,940
your chance of having a life-threatening attack

233
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,620
is well over 95%.

234
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,430
I think we'll take our chances.

235
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,540
You should talk it over between yourselves,

236
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,910
perhaps with a counselor --

237
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,430
I understand the situation.

238
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,390
I don't want the surgery.

239
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,370
I'll catch up.

240
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,210
Missed you at the research meeting.

241
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,270
I was in surgery. Craniotomy.

242
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,710
Now I have two consults, a meeting with a donor,

243
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,010
and a hospital chair meeting.

244
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,810
Well, don't forget to eat something.

245
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,160
Ah, food is for the weak.

246
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,290
So is waiting for this elevator.

247
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,450
Are we okay?

248
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,460
Yeah.

249
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,820
Sorry, I'm just busy.

250
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,770
We're recommending the stent.

251
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,200
It risks clotting, but it's also less invasive than the graft.

252
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,840
The graft would be a more permanent repair,

253
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,970
but there's greater chance of surgical complications.

254
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,800
I have to trust you, right?

255
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,080
Is Dad gonna be okay?

256
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,980
Oh, absolutely, darling.

257
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,130
We're gonna take good care of your dad.

258
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,860
He'll be home before you know it, okay?

259
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,050
Okay.

260
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,770
Thank you.

261
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,390
If we send her home without the surgery, she'll die.

262
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,450
We don't know that.

263
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,250
And taking away sex from a young couple in love?

264
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,210
That's devastating.

265
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,610
So's death.

266
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,850
How much time does a couple actually spend having sex?

267
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,020
19 minutes per week, including foreplay.

268
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,520
The rest -- - that's the real relationship.

269
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,800
Forget the act itself.

270
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,780
Sex is crucial to the happiness

271
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,470
and satisfaction of a relationship.

272
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,310
Sex is destructive.

273
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,470
It turns people into liars and cheaters and idiots.

274
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,800
It might start relationships,

275
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,850
but more often than not, it rips them apart.

276
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,750
She got devastating news

277
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,600
and made an emotional decision without thinking it through.

278
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,990
The least we can do is get her counseling.

279
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,440
Was she offered counseling when you gave her the diagnosis?

280
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,100
Briefly, but she was still reeling from the --

281
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,020
Then it's over.

282
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,930
When she's stable, discharge her.

283
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,850
Thank you.

284
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,160
Yeah, the pink heart and purple star...

285
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,230
How are you feeling?

286
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,010
Hi, Doctor. He's doing great.

287
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,310
Hi. I'm Dr. Browne.

288
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,820
You had a tear in your aorta,

289
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,580
but we stabilized it with a stent.

290
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,580
Until we can give you blood thinners,

291
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,910
you'll be at risk of a clot,

292
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,780
so we'll be monitoring you closely.

293
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,480
But right now, everything is looking absolutely perfect.

294
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,850
Gentle.

295
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,320
See, Cupcake?

296
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,680
It's all good.

297
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,180
Why didn't you come home last night?

298
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,860
Daddy had a sleepover at Uncle Jeff's.

299
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,160
He got a new turtle. You can see it next time.

300
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,530
Your blood pressure is responding well

301
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,810
to the alpha-blockers.

302
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,680
We'll run labs.

303
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,090
If they're normal, you can be discharged in the morning.

304
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,140
Thank you.

305
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,400
You'll want to be aware at all times

306
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,150
of where the closest hospital is.

307
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,380
Every time you have intercourse,

308
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,450
you'll be endangering your fiancée's life.

309
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,520
I-I'm aware of that.

310
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,680
We both are.

311
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,160
But it's Jeanie's body. It's her decision.

312
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,520
I'm just...trying to be supportive.

313
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,920
I don't think you are.

314
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,520
You're being selfish.

315
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,930
She's risking her life,

316
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,000
and you're keeping your mouth shut

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,520
so you can keep getting laid.

318
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,720
You do think I'm making the right decision?

319
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,650
Yes.

320
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,250
I do.

321
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,360
Thanks.

322
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,860
He really is gonna be fine.

323
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,270
I know. Thank you.

324
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,390
You okay?

325
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,700
I think he's cheating on me.

326
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,130
His brother lives in Willow Glen,

327
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,070
the other side of the city from where he had his accident.

328
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,540
What did he say about it?

329
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,830
That he had a breakfast meeting with a client.

330
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,740
Not unlike the excuse he used last time he cheated.

331
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,460
Him denying it was the worst part.

332
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,220
Made me doubt myself.

333
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,590
You know, was I just a paranoid, jealous wife,

334
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,290
throwing out wild accusations?

335
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,520
Your husband has just had a serious car accident,

336
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,820
and you're very stressed.

337
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,330
Right now, all you should be thinking about is...

338
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,200
getting him better.

339
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,180
You're right.

340
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,120
Thank you.

341
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,800
Not at all.

342
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,570
Would you like to take my top off?

343
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,470
Yes.

I'd like to go watch some TV.

370
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,390
So, eh, you weren't feeling it?

371
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,310
I was definitely feeling it.

372
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,260
She --

373
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,350
I don't know.

374
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,750
I think you're confused.

375
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,410
I think -- I think it's emotional

376
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,570
and it's hormonal, and -- and -- and maybe --

377
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,850
I wasn't confused.

378
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,810
She had a tattoo.

379
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,300
It was half a heart.

380
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,930
I don't understand why someone would get an incomplete tattoo.

381
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,000
She shouldn't have something that's incomplete

382
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,940
on her body that I can see.

383
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,280
You sure it was the tattoo?

384
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,890
Yes. It is a...

385
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,410
very disturbing tattoo that makes no sense.

386
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,710
Maybe it's not about the tattoo.

387
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,230
I mean...

388
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,320
maybe it's about intimacy?

389
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,990
Letting another person into your life -- that's a big deal.

390
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,340
I know. Trust me.

391
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,300
There are gonna be things about her that you love

392
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,750
and things about her that you don't.

393
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,140
And there are certain things, like the tattoo,

394
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,660
you -- you can't change.

395
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,250
Because...

396
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,260
because...

397
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,590
well, it's worth it.

398
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,960
She can get the tattoo removed.

399
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,380
She can't get the tattoo removed, Shaun.

400
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,010
I don't think it's about the tattoo.

401
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,040
We are backed up.

402
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,610
Sorry, Shaun.

403
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,900
Okay.

404
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,430
Everything looks good.

405
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,630
- Could've just checked them on the E.M.R. - I know.

406
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,470
How's it going with Shaun?

407
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,590
He tends to overshare with coworkers.

408
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,830
Yes, he does.

409
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,000
And he was oversharing up until this morning, so I'm guessing -

410
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,870
the Night of a Thousand Stars didn't go as planned?

411
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,740
We're fine, thanks.

412
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,100
Of course.

413
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,790
You waited three weeks for a kiss. You're a saint.

414
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,210
That didn't sound like a compliment.

415
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,420
I like Shaun, and I love that he's dating,

416
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,740
but I can't help thinking

417
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,360
that the kind of person who'd go out with Shaun

418
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,980
might be seeing him more as a project than a person.

419
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,390
And I'd rather not see him get his heart broken.

420
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,550
Last week, two techs called in sick.

421
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,460
I had to diagnose and file over 200 slides.

422
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,230
But when I told Shaun,

423
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,020
he came down and he helped me get through them

424
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,570
until three in the morning.

425
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,090
I am not going out with Shaun because I have a martyr complex.

426
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,770
I'm going out with him 'cause he's a great guy who treats me well.

427
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,740
And the condescending notion that

428
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,970
someone needs an ulterior motive to be interested in him

429
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,520
means you're the one who isn't seeing him as a person.

430
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,990
Your craniotomy ended an hour before the research meeting.

431
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,290
You didn't miss the meeting 'cause you were in surgery.

432
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,330
I think you missed the meeting because I was gonna be there.

433
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,050
I'm busy. I can show you my calendar if you'd like.

434
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,340
You dumped me. I should be the one avoiding you.

435
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,440
What's going on?

436
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,150
Are you having second thoughts?

437
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,470
No. I'm not.

438
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,570
Why are you willing to die for sex?

439
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,730
Sex creates...

440
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,420
vulnerability,

441
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,160
lets you be open, honest with each other,

442
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,970
share your biggest fears.

443
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,480
Sometimes, you shouldn't share.

444
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,330
Sometimes, you have to just accept, right?

445
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,310
Wrong.

446
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,070
What you have to accept, that's not for anyone else to say.

447
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,960
If you don't tell your partner everything that you're feeling,

448
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,780
thinking, worrying about,

449
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,160
then you aren't fully connected.

450
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,960
Close your eyes.

451
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,440
Yes, this is one of those dumb sensory exercises,

452
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,800
but just go with it.

453
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,310
Now tell me one of your favorite memories with your fiancée.

454
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,560
Last summer, we went camping in Yosemite.

455
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,110
We decided to rough it by only packing PB&J sandwiches.

456
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,800
The first night, a bear rips into our tent and devours them.

457
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,130
And the next night, of course, we had this hole in our tent,

458
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,080
and the mosquitos just ate us alive.

459
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,750
And the bug spray that we thought we packed?

460
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,750
It was sunscreen.

461
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,770
And then when it started pouring,

462
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,380
we turned to each other at the same time and we said,

463
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,760
"Denny's."

464
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,430
And that's when I knew I wanted to marry her.

465
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,600
Great.

466
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,890
That was a memory of something you got through together,

467
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,520
not about the time you had a threesome in Miami.

468
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,360
It was New Orleans.

469
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,330
The threesome was in New Orleans, not Miami.

470
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,450
And it was way better than the bear trip.

471
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,830
But I wasn't gonna tell my fiancée's doctor about it.

472
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,470
Sex...makes you real with someone.

473
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,290
Sex makes you stupid.

474
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,630
I had the perfect man.

475
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,980
He was...smart and funny.

476
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,680
He squeezed the sponge after washing the dishes.

477
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,030
Then one night, I-I met some guy and I had a few drinks,

478
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,100
and, um...

479
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,480
I got all tingly and got really stupid.

480
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,230
Never saw him again.

481
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,610
Or my boyfriend.

482
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,700
Sex can make us feel incredibly close to someone --

483
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,240
honest,

484
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,120
vulnerable.

485
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,500
But sex is not the goal.

486
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,170
All the rest of those things are.

487
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,380
She's the love of my life.

488
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,650
And I always thought that we were strong

489
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,510
and that we can overcome anything together.

490
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,440
But without sex...

491
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,400
I don't know if...

492
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,480
if we have enough.

493
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,400
Okay.

494
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,080
Then you need to lie to her.

495
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,960
Nurse said you'd be here an hour ago.

496
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,960
Yeah, well, you're not my only patient.

497
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,090
Look, I get it.

498
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,880
This is about as awkward as it gets.

499
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,470
Yes, it is.

500
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,930
You know, I almost died in that accident.

501
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,360
When I woke up, all I could think about was my wife...

502
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,230
and my little girl...

503
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,320
and how much of an ass I'd been and how hurt they'd be.

504
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,590
So, why is it that once I get out of here,

505
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,990
I'm gonna keep cheating on them?

506
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,620
I can't help it.

507
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,540
No matter how much remorse or guilt...

508
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,430
I feel like I always give in.

509
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,560
Then you should leave them.

510
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,630
I can't.

511
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,590
I love them.

512
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,840
How messed up is that, right?

513
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,100
But I think you know.

514
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,410
Yeah, well, I don't cheat.

515
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,560
I saw you checking me out in the bar.

516
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,440
My left hand,

517
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,280
just making sure I was married.

518
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,950
You're just as big a cheater as me, Dr. Browne.

519
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,040
My, uh, leg...

520
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,460
it's -- it's cold.

521
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,850
No pulse.

522
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,540
Your stent has formed a clot.

523
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,310
We need an angio, stat!

524
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,690
Everything okay?

525
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,570
You haven't said a word since "Pass the salt."

526
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,990
It's about Shaun, isn't it?

527
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,200
Two weeks ago,

528
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,260
you asked me to give him romantic advice,

529
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,710
which I didn't want to do.

530
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,020
And then he comes into my office for romantic advice,

531
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,770
and you kick him right out.

532
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,940
It's because you're helping him too much.

533
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,980
He is completely dependent on you.

534
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,770
For good reason.

535
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,820
He hasn't spoken to his parents since he was 14.

536
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,640
The only person he cared about...

537
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,930
died right in front of his eyes.

538
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,930
Aaron, I know how much you love him.

539
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,940
How you hate to see him struggle, fail, get hurt.

540
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,070
But you need to let him.

541
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,740
And he'll be okay.

542
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,360
Because he has someone else in his life now.

543
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,530
Just like you do.

544
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,500
Placing guide wire through the needle.

545
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,540
Placing catheter.

546
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,800
So, how do you know this guy?

547
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,810
You knew he was on MDMA,

548
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,230
you've been avoiding him since he arrived,

549
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,880
and...I checked on his accident.

550
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,890
It was a half mile from your place.

551
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,950
I was with him the night before the accident,

552
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,870
but it's not relevant.

553
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,240
It hasn't affected my judgement.

554
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,390
Yes, it has.

555
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,950
If you hadn't been avoiding him,

556
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,400
we could've caught the clot earlier.

557
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,070
I figure you've been going through something lately.

558
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,030
Something that's really hurt you.

559
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,120
And maybe it's making you turn to things you normally wouldn't.

560
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,930
But some of the guys you meet are gonna be trouble,

561
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,390
some are gonna be married, some are gonna --

562
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,830
He took a vow, not me.

563
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,690
That's the exact attitude someone had

564
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,260
when they helped ruin my life.

565
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,590
There's the clot.

566
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,520
Activating angio jet.

567
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,620
It's too big to bust.

568
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,810
We have to open him up.

569
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,290
You said to accept things I don't like, but Jeanie said

570
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,420
- I have to share everything, and I don't know   - Shaun. Shaun.

571
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,240
Shaun, stop, stop, stop.

572
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,740
I have to go home.

573
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,260
I can walk you to your car. Is it very far?

574
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,600
I think this discussion will take at least 15 minutes,

575
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,060
so maybe you can drive me?

576
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,680
We have to set boundaries, okay?

577
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,140
We have to set some limits.

578
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,040
You can't just come over 6:30 in the morning,

579
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
uh, uh, for flower advice.

580
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,860
You can't just pop into my office anytime you want.

581
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,150
Is this because of Debbie?

582
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,050
No.

583
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,970
Yes.

584
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,470
And I agree with her.

585
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,990
It was different when it was just the two of us,

586
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,120
but now we have people in our lives --

587
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,150
both of us.

588
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,520
We have to make them the priority.

589
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,280
Does this mean we can't talk anymore?

590
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,450
No, of course we can talk. Of --

591
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,130
It's just that there's a time and a place for everything.

592
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,210
And this is the wrong time and place?

593
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,550
Yeah.

594
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,520
7:00 A.M. Tuesday. Pancakes.

595
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,270
I liked it better

596
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,480
when it was just the two of us.

597
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,680
125 over 78.

598
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,740
Looks good.

599
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,720
Nice bug spray.

600
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,720
Spf 50.

601
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,100
Not much went right that trip.

602
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,430
But...

603
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,310
the more things went wrong,

604
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,360
the closer I felt to you.

605
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,030
We'll get through this, too.

606
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,950
I don't know.

607
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,620
Sex has always been...

608
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,960
our language.

609
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,790
Our way of sharing who we are with each other.

610
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,710
And if we lose that...

611
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,880
...what if we don't have enough?

612
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,050
We'll still have...

613
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,010
honesty,

614
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,060
intimacy,

615
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,640
love,

616
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,850
three kids.

617
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,810
Two boys and a girl.

618
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,820
I love you more than sex.

619
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,040
I love you more than sex, too.

620
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,140
Does...this mean you're getting the surgery?

621
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,350
Yeah.

622
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,290
90 minutes without a pulse in his leg.

623
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,660
He's at high risk for necrosis.

624
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,460
Prosthetic successfully sutured to aorta.

625
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,460
Almost done with the distal right anastomosis.

626
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,570
Careful not to narrow the artery during suturing.

627
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,420
Blood flow restored. Good arterial pulse.

628
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,480
Good job catching that clot, Dr. Browne.

629
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,800
If we'd waited any longer, we'd have to amputate.

630
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,770
Thank you. It...was a team effort.

631
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,020
Making incision at the vaginal wall.

632
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,620
Murphy, develop margins at the lesion.

633
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,500
Forceps.

634
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,530
Nicely done.

635
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,070
How you turned your patient around.

636
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,630
It was nice when Tony told Jeanie

637
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,530
he loved her more than sex.

638
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,580
He was lying.

639
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,420
I told him that if he cared about her at all, he had to.

640
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,380
Maybe it was the truth.

641
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,340
It can be true without him knowing it's true.

642
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,110
What's wrong?

643
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,050
Dr. Glassman told me I have to accept things,

644
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,590
but Jeanie said to be open and honest.

645
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,950
I agree with Jeanie --

646
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,620
whoever she is.

647
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,210
It's your tattoo.

648
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,350
Thank God. I thought you hated my boobs or something.

649
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,920
It's incomplete.

650
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,380
Didn't you have enough money to pay for a full heart?

651
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,230
I got this in high school.

652
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,720
It's incomplete.

653
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,770
Not anymore.

654
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,070
I got you.

655
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,840
Shaun?

656
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,760
Dr. Glassman was right.

657
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,140
It's not the tattoo.

658
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,090
We were able to restore blood flow to his legs.

659
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,490
He's gonna be just fine.

660
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,370
Thank you so much, Dr. Browne.

661
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,630
Now that he's out of the woods,

662
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,880
you don't need to feel guilty about questioning him.

663
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,550
All the pain, paranoia, and self-doubt...

664
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,800
you deserve to know the truth.

665
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,140
He's just gonna deny it.

666
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,220
Then you need to insist.

667
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,620
Our relationship was a stupid idea.

668
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,370
Which made ending it a smart idea.

669
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,000
Simple, binary...

670
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,250
and naive.

671
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,340
I really underestimated how hard this would be.

672
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,810
Yes, I've been having second thoughts.

673
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,870
I'm not saying we should get back together --

674
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,190
What are you saying?

675
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,150
I don't know.

676
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,150
Good.

677
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,410
It's...good to know that it's not easy.

678
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,540
It's good to know that it mattered.

679
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,050
Intimacy isn't about a tattoo.

680
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,140
And it's not about touching or kissing or...

681
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,060
even sex.

682
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,520
It's about sharing your biggest fears.

683
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,480
Yes.

684
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,150
What are you scared of?

685
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,160
I love being a pathologist.

686
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,760
But every day I walk into the lab,

687
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,420
I am filled with doubt.

688
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,230
Am I smart enough? Am I capable enough?

689
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,880
Do I really deserve to be here?

690
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,480
How long until someone walks in and exposes my fraud

691
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,840
and has me removed from the premises?

692
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,470
Eventually, those thoughts retreat.

693
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,620
Until the next morning,

694
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,020
when they all come crashing back into my brain.

695
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,570
That and pigeons.

696
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,820
They freak me out.

697
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,620
My biggest fear...

698
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,210
...is that I'll be alone.

699
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,340
If I don't get over this, you'll leave.

700
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,660
We don't have to have sex.

701
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,830
Can we just hold each other for a little bit?

702
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,760
I think I'd like that.

703
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,670
Shaun?

704
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,160
You should go.

705
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,390
I don't know. Maybe.

706
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,090
It can wait till tomorrow morning.

707
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,960
Eh, you were right.

708
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,220
Everything you said was right.

709
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,590
But this is different.

710
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,680
Shaun needs you.

711
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,390
Your mom called from Wyoming.

712
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,220
Your dad's been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

713
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,940
He may only have a few days left.
