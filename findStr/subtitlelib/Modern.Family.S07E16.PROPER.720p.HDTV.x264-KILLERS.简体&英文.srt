恐怕不吧
I don't think so.

43
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,690
你好面熟  我怎么想到了长椅上的广告
You look so familiar. Why am I picturing a bench ad?

44
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,320
小有名气  不得不承认了
Minor celebrity. Guilty as charged.

45
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,510
你是牙医广告上那个人
You're the "Accidentes" guy.

其实我最近正在找房子

00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,440
我没  我手头没有名片
I don't -- I don't have any cards.

53
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,220
我穿的是去健身房的衣服
I'm in my gym clothes.

54
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,930
看来那杯热巧克力是锻炼后的奖赏啦
Oh, I see you earned that hot chocolate.

55
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,080
是啊  我刚刚进行了一次
Yeah, I rocked a pretty intense 

56
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,960
高强度摇哑铃快步走

早上好  邻居们

58
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,100
我昨天看到了你女儿  家有小女初长成

59
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,920
我叫安吉
My name is Angie.

60
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,550
这是我的号码
Here is my number.

61
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,370
如果你在这附近有看到什么三卧室的房子
If you find any good three-bedrooms in the neighborhood,

62
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,390
可以介绍我看看
I'd love to see them.

63
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,060
我会给你打电话的  很愿意带你看房
Well, I'll call you. I'd love to show them to you.

64
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,740
我可不只有一张让人们坐的帅脸[板凳广告]
I'm not just a pretty face people sit on.

65
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,090
当作没听见吧
Forget...I said that.

66
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,150
来了
Here you go.

67
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,200
谢谢  亲爱的
Oh, thanks, honey.

68
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,380
安吉是谁
Who's Angie?

69
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,980
我刚在里面见到的一个女的
Just a woman I m-met inside.

70
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,720
是吗  她还给你她的号码了
Really? She gave you her number?

71
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,460
还把"i"上的点画成了小爱心
And dotted her "i" with a little heart?

72
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,100
对啦  她在找房子
Oh, yeah. She's looking for a house.

73
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,940
温柔的老女人
Sweet old lady.

74
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,180
我不知道我为什么那么说
Don't know why I said that.

75
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,050
有点胖
Little overweight.

76
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,520
不知道我怎么想的
No idea where that came from.

77
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,650
非常重的爱尔兰口音
Thick Irish accent.

78
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,780
我慌神了
I panicked!

79
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,580
我应该说实话的
I should have told the truth,

80
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,580
但是克莱尔知道我  有个喜欢的类型
but Claire knows I have... a type.

81
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,610
那只是个善意[白人]的谎言
It was just a little white lie.

82
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,990
很讽刺吧
Ironically.

83
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,090
你好  美国
Hey, America!

84
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,610
我没看到你们来了
I didn't see you there.

85
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,480
欢迎来到全新的网络直播节目"杰说心语"
Welcome to another live webcast of "Jay Talking."

86
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,500
{\an8}杰说心语
杰·普里契特

87
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,330
你们知道我很讨厌什么吗
You know what really gets my goat?

88
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,710
山羊奶酪
Goat cheese.

89
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,800
到处都有
It's on everything.

90
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,060
我讨厌死了
I hate it.

91
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,790
唯一比山羊奶酪更讨厌的是
The only thing worse than goat cheese

92
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,530
跟一些在室内戴帽子的傻瓜
is eating it at a communal table

93
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,190
一起在公共场合吃那玩意儿
with some jerk wearing a hat inside.

94
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,620
放尊重点
Have some respect.

95
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,220
把裤子拉上去
And pull up your pants!

96
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,580
{\an8}有些胖子裤子提不上去  弯腰的时候屁股缝会漏出来

97
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,580
我唯一想看到的裂纹是独立钟上的那条
Only crack I want to see is in the Liberty Bell.

98
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,100
地球上最棒的国家
Greatest country on the damn planet.

99
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,160
如果六个月前
If, six months ago,

100
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,100
你告诉我我会办一个很厉害的网络节目
you'd have told me I'd have a big Internet show,

101
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,790
我会说那挺合理的
I would have said, "Yeah, that adds up."

102
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,640
我以前常常用笑话和评论逗乐我的员工们
I used to entertain my staff with jokes and observations.

103
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,440
我退休后
When I retired,

104
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,740
我开始也在这家里这么干
I started sharing those gems around the house.

105
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,990
结果曼尼太喜欢了  于是建了个网络直播站
Manny went so nuts for it, he set up the whole webcast.

106
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,240
抱歉  互联网  把锅甩给你们了
Sorry, Internet. He's your problem now.

107
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,740
你们一天圈这人圈那人倒还不那么招人厌
Bottom line, you can keep your hashtags,

108
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,110
因为我喜欢炸薯饼[谐音]
'cause I like hashbrowns.

109
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,940
但是...
But, hey...

110
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,200
那只是"杰说心语"
that's just "Jay Talking."

111
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,500
结束了
And we're out.

112
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,140
90分钟时间飞逝
90 minutes just flew by.

113
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,070
各位
Hey, guys!

114
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,640
评论已经进来了
The comments are already rolling in!

115
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,060
"继续下去  杰"
"Keep it up, Jay."

116
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,010
"你说的正是我们想的"
"You're saying what we're all thinking."

117
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,960
"我也好想念炒杂碎[美式中菜]"
"I miss Chop Suey, too."

118
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,460
我爱死了
I love it, 

119
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,680
因为大家都会看到我天天要忍受什么了
because now everybody gets to see what I live with.

120
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,060
什么情况  又是这个家伙
What the hell? This guy again? 

121
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,600
谁
Who?

122
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,920
一个名叫"女士杀手52"的傻瓜
Some meatball named "LadyKiller52"

123
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,900
已经连续骚扰我好几天了
been dogging me for days.

124
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,770
看看他写了什么
Look what he wrote.

125
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,470
“老头  没人管你想什么"
"Hey, Grandpa, no one cares what you think."

126
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,870
你确定那不是海莉说的吗
Are you sure that that's not from Haley?

127
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,500
这还有一条  还是那个傻瓜发的
Here's another one. The same jerk!

128
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,280
"真奇怪你居然不喜欢山羊奶酪"
"It's weird you don't like goat cheese

129
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,230
"你长得就像山羊啊"
when you've got a goat face."

130
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,550
这说不通啊
Well, that makes no sense. 

131
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,870
什么山羊会吃自己的奶酪啊
What kind of goat eats its own cheese?

132
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,240
我来这里  想为美国人带来欢笑  引发思考
Here I am, trying to make America laugh and think,

133
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,790
结果这个傻瓜老是跑来骂我
and this hockey puck's coming at me with tired insults.

134
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,060
好吧  他就是在故意煽动  杰
Okay, I-it's called a troll, Jay.

135
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,960
但你不能让他或者任何什么事情
But you can't let him or anything else

136
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,790
阻止你把你的所有想法
keep you from directing all of your opinions

137
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,780
都传到电脑里
into that computer.

138
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,440
没错  曼尼
You're right, Manny.

139
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,610
做公众人物确实不容易
It's tough being in the public eye.

140
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,140
总算知道辛纳特拉[美国歌手]为什么老打人了
Now I know why Sinatra was always punching guys.

141
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,140
好啊  克莱尔
Hola, Claire.

142
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,740
怎么了
What's going on?

143
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,460
你经常做瑜伽对吧
You do a lot of yoga, right?

144
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,600
以前啦
Ah, I used to.

145
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,820
但是跟那些扎着马尾
But all those judgy vegans

146
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,680
穿着紧身裤的圣母严格素食主义者在一起
with their ponytails and their Lululemon,

147
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,390
我觉得自己土鳖还是待在家里算了  你懂吧
I'm like, "Nama-stay home," You know what I mean?

148
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,900
我刚开始学
I just started taking it,

149
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,630
但我觉得那个教练喜欢上我了
but I think that the instructor is hitting on me.

150
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,920
-没错  -你怎么知道
- He is. - How do you know?

151
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,060
因为你穿着瑜伽裤[很紧绷]呢
Because you're you in yoga pants.

152
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,760
换个课上吧
Just go to another class.

153
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,360
但是这课真的很好
But this one is perfect.

154
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,110
正好跟乔去上金宝贝同一时间
It's at the same time as Joe's Gymboree,

155
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,750
又在隔壁
right next door.

156
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,360
要不你跟我一起去
Ay, why don't you come with me today

157
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,120
然后告诉我是不是我想太多了
and tell me if I'm just being crazy?

158
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,680
行啊  把具体信息发给我
Sure. Text me the info.

159
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,420
提醒她
Hey, remind her!

160
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,840

把菜单写在黑板上的饭馆

164
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,880
我想要菜单在我手里的感觉
I want to feel a menu in my hands!

165
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,600
姐们
Hey, girl.

166
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,770
-你要干什么  -没什么
- What are you doing? - Nothing.

167
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,960
就是想跟你打个招呼  聊点事情
Just wanted to say hi, talk about stuff.

168
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,690
什么事情
What stuff? 

169
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,820
我不知道  我只是想你了
I don't know. I just miss you.

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,340
什么都可以聊啊
We could talk about anything.

171
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,510
聊聊  水门事件怎么样
How about... Watergate?

172
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,490
比如  你觉得
Like, what would you say

173
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,870

175

把引文也说一下
Cite your sources.

176

我不会帮你写论文的
I'm not writing your essay.

177
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,990
好吧  复活节见
Okay. See you at Easter.

178
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,970
我回来了
I'm back.

179
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,490
带"小心心"安吉看房看得怎么样了
How'd your showing with Angie-with-a-heart go?

180
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,620
还好吧  都挺正常的
Oh, fine. Uneventful.

181
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,950
乏善可陈
Nondescript.

182
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,130
这个淋浴房好小啊
This shower's really small.

183
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,940
你能想象我用这浴室吗
Could you imagine me in here?

184
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,020
非常奇怪  我跟她在一起待了两个小时
Weird thing -- I was with her for two hours,

185
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,200
放在人群里我还是认不出她
I couldn't pick her out of a crowd.

186
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,390
真的吗  太奇怪了
Really? That is weird.

187
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,370
没什么奇怪的啊
Nothing weird about it.

188
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,440
你刚刚说那很奇怪
You just said it was weird.

189
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,990
那确实很奇怪  亲一个
That's weird. Give me a kiss!

190
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,870
你在干什么呢  兄弟
What are you up to, buddy?

191
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,030
写一篇关于尼克松总统的论文
Writing a paper on President Nixon.

192
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,160
好傻啊
What an idiot.

193
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,590
他拥有了一切  又因为一些愚蠢的谎言
He had it all and just threw it away

194
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,960
失去了这一切
because of some stupid lie.

195
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,100
也许他说出口之前
Well, maybe it came out of his mouth

196
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,520
都不知道自己在说什么
before he knew what he was saying.

197
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,210
然后他的谎越撒越多
Okay, but then he just kept lying over and over

198
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,710
接着要用更多的谎去圆
and making it worse and worse.

199
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,950
菲尔  安吉多大
Phil, how old is Angie?

200
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,150
70岁  怎么了
Oh, uh, gosh... 70. Why?

201
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,930
我在想福赛斯街那套房子
I was thinking about that house on Forsyth.

202
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,450
挺不错的  就是楼梯多了点
It's nice but has a lot of stairs.

203
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,570
不  她太胖了没法住
No. She's too... fat for that.

204
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,780
因此  我将从今天中午起
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency

205
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,270
辞去总统职务
effective at noon tomorrow.

206
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,550
他要是说实话就好了
If only he had told the truth.

207
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,960
他陷得太深了
He was in too deep!

208
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,440
看看我买了什么
Check out what I got!

209
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,270
不用了  谢谢
No, thanks.

210
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,530
我们明天可以去公园
Thought we could go to the park tomorrow

211
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,780
这样你就可以开始尝试学了
and you could finally learn.

212
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,970
尝尝水泥地的味道吗
What pavement tastes like?

213
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,370
我不想去
I don't think so.

214
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,490
莉莉  等你准备好了随时可以用
Well, Lily, when you're ready, it's here for you.

215
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,350
米奇尔  我们能去卧室
Mitchell, can I, um, speak to you in the bedroom

216
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,880
聊聊床罩的事吗
about the, uh, dust ruffle?

217
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,990
别担心  "床罩"现在就走
Don't worry -- the dust ruffle's leaving.

218
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,020
你干嘛这么做
Okay, why are you doing this?

219
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,490
我们得让莉莉学会骑车
We need Lily to get on this bike.

220
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,010
你为什么那么逼她这么紧
Why are you pushing this so hard?

221
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,280
很明显她害怕
She's clearly afraid.

222
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,140
她最近怕很多事
She's been afraid of a lot of things lately.

223
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,860
上周  她连衣橱门都不开
Last week, she wouldn't even open her closet door

224
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,040
因为她觉得里面有可怕的东西
because she thought something scary was in there.

225
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,890
可能是你妈给她做的牛仔连身裤
Could be the denim jumpsuit your mom made her.

226
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,200
这是个关键时刻
This is a pivotal moment.

227
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,490
我们的孩子绝不能
We can't raise a child

228
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,220
连车都不会骑  或者害怕上飞机
who won't ride a bike or get on an airplane

229
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,760
或者不吃蛋黄酱
or eat mayonnaise.

230
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,980
跟口感有关  鸡蛋怎么会变成那个样子
It's a texture thing. How does egg become that?

231
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,300
明天学定了  她一定要骑上这部车
We are doing this tomorrow. She is getting on this bike.

232
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,850
你急什么啊  她才八岁
What's the rush? She's 8 years old.

233
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,010
大部分她同龄的越南孩子都骑着单车去工作了
Most Vietnamese kids her age are already riding a bike to work.

234
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,010
圣雄之手在哪
So, where's Mahatma Handsy?

235
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,710
我知道你很会玩瑜伽方面的双关语
I noticed that you have a lot of these yoga puns.

236
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,210
我觉得我们不需要用那些
I don't think we need any more.

237
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,560
合十礼
Namaste.

238
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,420
好吧  他还是老样子
Okay. Now I get the one from before.

239
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,540
我们没见过吧
We haven't met.

240
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,300
克莱尔
Claire.

241
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,180
克莱尔
Claire. 

242
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,740
你真美
Beautiful.

243
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,980
就像唐君鲁的日出一般
Like the sunrise in Tanjung Rhu.

244
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,750
你身材很适合练瑜伽  以前练过吗
You have a great yoga body. You've done this before?

245
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,510
挺久以前了  不过我是练过
Um, yeah. I mean, it's been a little while, but yeah.

246
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,070
姿势很棒  很有力量
Great posture, strong core.

247
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,440
你会享受一番的
We're going to have fun.

248
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,330
也许我最近压力有点大  不过我错了
Maybe I've just been stressed lately, but I was wrong.

249
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,390
瑜伽很有意思
Yoga felt good.

250
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,280
把臀部撅向天花板
We are lifting our hips towards the ceiling.

251
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,460
很棒  克莱尔
Very nice, Claire.

252
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,750
拉很擅长指导
Ra was very supportive.

253
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,090
也许是我以前没找对教练
Maybe I just never had the right teacher.

254
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,660
我做对了吗
Am I doing it right?

255
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,870
而且还能免费停车
And they validate parking.

256
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,290
又来了一条
Another one?

257
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,420
我受够了这个叫女士杀手的混蛋
I've had it with this LadyKiller son of a bitch.

258
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,040
他一整晚都在骂我的视频
He's been lobbing insults all night.

259
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,040
"蠢货  我能透过网络闻到你的呼吸"
"Hey, dumbbell, I can smell your breath through the Internet."

260
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,330
这应该不可能吧
They can't do that, right?

261
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,290
杰  听听我这个局外人的意见
Jay, take it from a fellow performer --

262
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,660
如果你决定成为公众人物
If you're going to put yourself out there,

263
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,580
那就要做好面对负面评论的
you need to let the criticism roll off your back.

264
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,800
说真的  我蛮惊讶的  你居然没有因为
I must say, I was impressed you didn't mope for a month

265
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,220
对你《音乐之声》上表现的恶评抑郁一整个月
after that brutal review of you in "Sound of Music".

266
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,440
你说什么呢  哪有评论啊
What are you talking about? There was no review.

267
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,070
那周学校没有校报
There was no school paper that week.

268
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,340
就是啊  那周没有校报
Eeeeeexactly. There was no paper that week.

269
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,520
对啊
Oh, yeah.

270
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,750
你做了什么
What did you do?

271
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,590
我
I...

272
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,560
我不会傻站在这里
I am not going to stand here

273
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,940
让你把校报被偷的错都怪在我身上
and let you accuse me of stealing all of those papers!

274
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,490
他没那么说
He didn't say that.

275
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,940
"看过曼尼·迪尔加多"
"After seeing Manny Delgado

276
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,060
"演崩了的冯特拉普上校"
mangle the role of Captain Von Trapp,

277
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,220
"我只想说  上帝啊  让他停下吧"
all I can say is "Doe-a-dear Lord, make it stop.

278
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,190
"搞得我年纪轻轻就得开始吃抗抑郁药了"
I am 16 going on antidepressants.

279
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,910
"我想爬上所有山峰然后跳下来"
I wanted to climb every mountain and jump off."

280
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,730
什么老师会允许这种文章
What teacher allowed this?

281
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,780
爷爷好
Hey, Grandpa.

282
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,630
亲爱的
Hi, honey!

283
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,580
真高兴你打电话过来
Oh, I'm so glad you called.

284
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,960
我这周真是太糟糕了
I've just been having the worst week.

285
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,980
我压力太大了
It's been so overwhelming and so much --

286
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,740
你知道该怎么办吗  喝杯鸡尾酒
You know what helps? A cocktail.

287
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,330
听着  我现在有个问题
Listen, I've got a situation.

288
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,020
你认识能够在网上
Do you know any computer nerds

289
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,090
查到人家身份的电脑死宅吗
that can track someone down on the Internet?

290
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,920
我应该认识一些
Yeah, I think I can find a few.

291
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,990
好了  很激动吧  莉莉
Okay! How exciting is this, Lily?

292
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,140
马上你就能学会骑单车了
In no time at all, you're gonna be a bike rider.

293
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,640
或者变成一具尸体
Or a corpse. Okay...

294
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,860
我知道你害怕  要是你能够说出
I know you're afraid, and sometimes it's helpful

295
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,610
自己究竟怕什么  会更有帮助
if you say exactly what you're afraid of out loud.

296
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,320
所以呢
So...?

297
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,480
我害怕自己会摔倒
I'm afraid I'll fall

298
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,290
因为我还没准备好而你一直逼我
because I'm not ready and you forced me,

299
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,840
我下半辈子都会记着这仇了
so for the rest of my life, I'll hold it against you.

300
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,600
而在其他时间
And then other times,

301
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,970
还是应该克服困难坚持去学
it's just best to tamp it down and soldier on.

302
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,920
你把她从车上拽出来的时候我就说过了
I said this when you pried her out of the car,

303
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,700
我再说一遍  她不想学
and I'll say this again -- she doesn't want to do this!

304
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,810
她看到这有多简单就会想学了
She will when she sees how easy it is for me.

305
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,860
看吧  小菜一碟
See? Easy as pie!

306
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,190
莉莉  如果你不想学
Okay, look, Lily, if you don't want to do this --

307
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,820
-我不想学  -好吧
- I don't want to do this. - Okay.

308
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,230
我没事
I'm good!

309
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,140
听着  我会去跟爸爸说
Um... look. All right. I'm gonna talk to Daddy.

310
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,290
不过答应我你总有一天会学的
But just promise me you'll learn someday, okay?

311
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,790
还有你会去坐飞机
And that you'll get on a plane.

312
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,780
我为什么会不想上飞机  什么情况
Why wouldn't I get on a plane? What's wrong with them?

313
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,730
没事  飞机比车安全
Nothing. They're safer than cars.

314
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,040
车不安全吗  天哪
Cars aren't safe?! Oh, my God.

315
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,600
大爸来了
Okay! Look -- here's Daddy.

316
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,580
我平安地回来了
Here we are, safe and sound!

317
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,590
-发生什么事了  -没什么
- What's wrong? -Nothing.

318
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,800
我想到吃完早餐以后忘了关烤箱
I just think I left the oven on at home after breakfast,

319
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,870
我们得走了
so we should get going.

320
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,850
谢天谢地
Thank God.

321
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,750
你早上吃的是麦片
No, you had cereal for breakfast.

322
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,740
发生什么事了
What's going on?

323
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,770
我摔了一跤  好像把胳膊摔折了
I wiped out, and I think I broke my arm.

324
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,350
我从来没这么疼过
I've never been in so much pain.

325
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,110
保持微笑
Keep smiling.

326
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,010
得送你去急诊室
Got to get you to an ER.

327
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,090
不  不要  不要
No, don't! No, no!

328
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,160
莉莉要是看到我受伤肯定不会想学骑车的
If Lily sees me hurt, she's never gonna get on a bike.

329
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,010
你摔是因为那个慢跑的裸男吧
You crashed because of that shirtless jogger, didn't you?

330
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,440
天啊  他是有够性感
Oh, my God. Right?

331
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,840
歌洛莉亚  我刚还在想你今天会不会来
Oh, Gloria! I was wondering if you were gonna be here today.

332
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,070
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

333
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,940
我得说  我还以为我已经厌倦瑜伽了
I got to say, I thought I was over yoga,

334
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,260
可是昨天真是让我大开眼界
but yesterday was a real eye-opener.

335
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,740
大开"眼界"还是"腿界"啊
"Eye" or "Thigh"?

336
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,980
我觉得这个课很有挑战性
I thought it was a very challenging class,

337
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,660
还有我不太喜欢你暗示的东西
and I don't really appreciate anything else you're implying,

338
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,610
因为你有点...
'cause you're a little...

339
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,200
我怎么了
I'm what?

340
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,400
嫉妒
Jealous.

341
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,070
嫉妒什么  嫉妒他蹭你吗
Of what? Of him rubbing you

342
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,550
蹭得好像要把灯灵放出来了吗
like he was expecting a genie to come out?

343
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,970
你一直都习惯成为男性的关注焦点
Look, you are so used to being the center of men's attention

344
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,740
昨天你可能有点不开心  因为我也得到了
that yesterday, it probably bothered you that I... got some.

345
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,640
关注  仅此而已  仅仅是关注
Attention. That's all. Just attention.

346
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,240
你疯了吗  我都结婚了
That's insane. I am a married woman.

347
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,770
我一直都得不到什么关注
I am used to getting no attention.

348
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,490
不  安吉  你离我只有一个转角
No, Angie, you're like right around the corner from me.

349
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,110
对  向左转  朝西走
Yeah, turn left, walk west,

350
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,320
我们美发沙龙门口见
and I'll see you in front of the hair salon.

351
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,670
好的  待会儿见
All right. See you in a minute.

352
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,580
菲尔
Phil?

353
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,580
不要啊
No!

354
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,150
你们准备干什么去
What are you guys up to?

355
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,330
我要上瑜伽课
I have a yoga class.

356
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,700
很明显  克莱尔也要一起去
And, apparently, Claire does, too.

357
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,820
你在这里干嘛
What are you doing here?

358
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,980
正准备带我的胖爱尔兰客户
Oh, just on my way to show more houses

359
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,280
安吉·整容婆去看房子
to my fat, Irish client, Angie O'Plasty.

360
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,510
我要进去了
I'm going in.

361
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,830
我会告诉拉你到了
I will tell Ra that you're here.

362
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,010
拉是我们的瑜伽教练
Ra is our yoga instructor.

363
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,430
她肯定很厉害  你都连续两天来这儿了
Oh, she must be great. You're here two days in a row.

364
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,930
她是挺厉害的
She is great.

365
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,620
就是年纪有点大
She's a little old.

366
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,070
真不清楚我为啥那么说
Don't know why I said that.

367
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
我得进去了
I got to go.

368
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,580
回[黑]家见
See you black home.

369
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,040
非常清楚我为什么那么说
Pretty sure I know why I said that.

370
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,430
这是我人生中最大的伤痛
This is the most pain I've ever been in in my life.

371
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,640
况且我曾经还被马一脚踢到电铁丝网上呢
And a horse once kicked me into an electric fence.

372
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,230
好了小卡  你的胳膊断了
Well, C-Cam, yeah, you broke your arm.

373
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,140
你得去医院
You got to go to the hospital.

374
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,330
不  不着急
No. Not yet.

375
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,610
我先进房  泡个澡
I'll go in, draw myself a bath,

376
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,750
然后假装滑倒把胳膊给摔断了
pretend to fall and break my arm.

377
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,520
与此同时  你把你扭伤脚的时候
In the meantime, go get those painkillers

378
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,040
用的止痛药拿来
that they gave you when you twisted your ankle.

379
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,130
我好像已经扔了
Oh, I think I threw those away.

380
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,880
真的吗
Did you?

381
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,170
还是你把它们放在你枕边的床头柜上了
Or are they in the nightstand next to your bed

382
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,150
因为它们是很好的红酒伴侣
because they go good with a glass of wine?

383
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,540
大爸
Dad?

384
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,250
怎么了
Yeah?

385
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,500
你能把这个打开吗
Can you open these?

386
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,410
当然可以了
'Course I can.

387
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,980
好  那你开吧
Well? Will you?

388
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,000
可以呀  现在就要开吗
Uh...sure. Yeah. Now?

389
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,320
试试看
Let's see here.

390
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,550
那啥
Ooh, you know what?

391
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,750
要开这个其实有个很好玩的办法
There's a fun way to open these

392
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,130
不知道我有没有教过你
I don't know if I've ever taught you.

393
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,070
搞定  我的妈呀
There! Whoopsie-daisy!

394
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,040
祝你吃得开心  洗澡时间到
Bon appetit. Bath time!

395
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,900
好了  我拿来了
Okay, so, I got the --

396
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,730
这是怎么回事
What happened here?

397
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,130
大爸开的薯片
Daddy opened the chips.

398
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,850
用什么开的  吹雪机吗
With what -- a snowblower?

399
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,560
那是什么声音呢
Oh, I wonder what that noise was.

400
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,010
真希望大爸没事
I hope Daddy's okay!

401
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,580
-大爸  -噢  不
- Daddy! - Oh, no!

402
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,360
你看上去好像滑倒了  摔断了左手臂
Looks like you fell and broke your, uh, left arm.

403
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,940
不  米奇尔  我摔了  真心摔了
No, Mitchell, I fell. I really fell.

404
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,820
-这是真的吗  -真的
- Oh, really? - Really.

405
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,830
你没事吧
Are you okay?

406
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,200
头好痛  手臂也好痛
My head hurts. And my arm.

407
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
我再也不要洗澡了
I'm never taking a bath again!

408
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,730
这下好了
Oh, great.

409
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,720
你没从钢管上掉下来真是不幸
Too bad you didn't fall off a stripper pole.

410
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,560
对不起
I-I'm sorry.

411
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,190
那是左手臂  在左手边
That is the left. Left.

412
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,890
艾丽克斯找的电脑宅给我的地址就是这儿
Well, this is the address Alex's nerds gave me,

413
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,070
但我觉得这不像是挑衅鬼住的地方
but it's not where I pictured a troll living.

414
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,060
"自从主演《音乐之声》"
"After his performance in 'The Sound of Music,'"

415
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,220
"克里斯托弗·普卢默走上了杰出演员之路"
"Christopher Plummer went on to a distinguished acting career."

416
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,600
"而自从看了迪尔加多的表演  我认为"
After Delgado's performance, I expect he'll go on

417
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,120
"他可以走上杰出水管工[谐音普卢默]之路"
"to a distinguished plumbing career."

418
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,090
专心点  你得给我明天的节目拍好这段
Focus! I need you to film this for my show tomorrow.

419
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,930
还有如果这个废物未成年  就得靠你揍他了
By the way, if the punk's under 18, you have to hit him.

420
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,930
{\an8}美国传统教育允许用拳头解决问题  但要自己承担责任  同时未成年人不打比自己小的  成年人不打未成年人

421
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,010
什么  我可没同意这点
What?! I never agreed to that!

422
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,750
普里契特
Pritchett?

423
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,610
厄尔
Earl?

424
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,610
{\an8}杰的前合作伙伴  "衣柜衣柜衣柜"公司老板

425
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,480
你是在逗我吧
You've got to be kidding me.

426
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,770
你来这里干什么
What the hell are you doing here?

427
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,830
我来打女士杀手的肥脸
I'm here to punch LadyKiller in his fat face.

428
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,530
抱歉能再来一遍吗  我调的是拍照模式
I'm sorry. Can we start over? I was on "Photo."

429
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,250
继续吧  我准备好了
Go ahead. Any time.

430
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,900
你真可悲
You're pathetic.

431
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,640
我在衣柜生意上狠狠打败了你
I crushed you in the closet game,

432
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,210
我也要在互联网上打败你
and I'm crushing it on the Internet.

433
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,430
把那耗子放下  我要把你打趴在门口
Put that rat down, and I'll crush you on your porch.

434
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,500
这样也比不上你的没脑乱叫让人痛苦
Like that is gonna be any more painful than your stupid rant,

435
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,580
"餐厅什么时候变得这么吵了"
"When did restaurants get so loud?"

436
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,400
我早该知道是你
I should have known it was you --

437
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,630
你的短胖小手指打了那么多错字
all those typos from your stubby fingers.

438
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,230
怎么说话呢  我的手是像我妈
Watch it. I got my mother's hands.

439
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,160
你的猥琐胡子也像你妈
You also have your mother's mustache.

440
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,910
-拿着  -帮我拿着
- Hold this! - Hold this.

441
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,430
整整撕了二十秒
That went on for a good 20 seconds.

442
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,350
我们干嘛要一直互撕
Why do we keep doing this?!

443
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,440
谁知道呢
Who knows?

444
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,640
你们还看不出来吗
Isn't it obvious?

445
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,810
你们两个彼此需要  这就是原因
You two need each other. It's what drives you.

446
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,410
这孩子说得对
The kid is right.

447
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,000
我起床有一半原因是为了战胜你
Beating you is half the reason I get out of bed.

448
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,490
纠缠不休的角斗
Locking horns.

449
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,830
我们促使彼此变得更好
We made each other better

450
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,020
比我想象的还要好
than I ever thought we could be.

451
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,300
把对方推到了伟大的高度上
Pushed each other to greatness.

452
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,710
不能更高
We touched the sky.

453
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,490
但是我们说的是衣柜生意  对吧
We're talking about closets here, right?

454
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,260
抱歉  你是在说那个
Oh, I'm sorry -- You mean the sanctuary

455
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,430
让男人早晨得以充分武装
where a man dons his armor in the morning

456
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,090
夜晚总结回顾一天战斗的圣所吗
and takes stock of the battle at night?!

457
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,230
我们所有人拥有的一个共同点
The one thing we all have in common --

458
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,970
不管是总统还是邮递员  大亨还是教师
presidents to postmen, tycoons to teachers,

459
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,850
穿越四海
from sea to shining sea!

460
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,080
这剧情转变得也太诡异了
This is taking a weird turn.

461
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,990
我们的确让彼此展现出了最好的一面
We did kind of bring out the best in each other,

462
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,480
不是吗
didn't we?

463
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,990
你干嘛非得退休呢  普里契特
Why did you have to retire, Pritchett?

464
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,910
我想念我们之间的火花
I miss the fire.

465
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,410
我猜我也无法割舍
I guess I miss it, too.

466
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,210
好吧  我想说
All right, here's something.

467
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,510
我们一起拍视频秀怎么样
What if we do the show together?

468
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,820
什么  不要
What? No!

469
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,330
我才不会让你盯上我的新晋热门秀呢
I'm not gonna let you glom onto my new hit show!

470
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,060
阅读量只有43
43 views.

471
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,530
我们可以做一期观点对立的那种节目
We could do like a -- like a point/counterpoint kind of thing.

472
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,240
比如说我提出一个观点  像...
Like I would say something like, uh...

473
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,640
"废弃美分吧"  然后你的观点是
"Let's get rid of pennies," And you would say...

474
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,250
我们当然该弃用美分
Of course we should get rid of pennies!

475
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,170
美分用起来太烦了
They're annoying to own

476
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,620
要真扔了它们你又会不乐意
and make you feel bad when you throw them out.

477
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,780
好吧  那我就说"怀念送奶工"
All right, what -- what if I said "I miss milkmen"?

478
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,280
谁不怀念呢
Who doesn't miss milkmen?

479
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,230
那牛奶瓶  那小领结
The glass bottle, little bow tie.

480
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,220
我是傻子吗  我会不怀念送奶工
What am I, an idiot? I don't miss milkmen?

481
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,750
行  那你来出主意
Okay, well, then you think of something!

482
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,960
我可不是被试镜的那个
I'm not the one auditioning.

483
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,060
好吧
Okay.

484
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,040
我想到一个代表我独特思维的点子
Here's something that represents my unique brand of thinking.

485
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,110
我坐飞机的时候  觉得行李费收得好
When I fly, I like luggage fees.

486
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,910
我也是
Me too.

487
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,240
我们这些随身携带行李的人凭什么
Why should us carry-on folk have to foot the bill

488
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,910
要替不懂打包行李的笨蛋承担费用呢
for those morons who don't know how to pack?!

489
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,760
整整三个星期  我从爱丁堡飞到华沙
Three weeks, I went from Edinburgh to Warsaw

490
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,130
只穿两条裤子戴一顶苏格兰宽顶无沿圆帽
on two pairs of pants and a tam-o'-shanter.

491
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,030
我快睡着了
I'm falling asleep.

492
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,750
-我喜欢打个小盹  -谁不是呢
- I love naps! - Who doesn't?

493
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,070
这太可笑了
This is ridiculous!

494
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,840
你觉得可笑是不是因为尽管你们是死敌
The irony that, despite you two being mortal enemies,

495
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,210
但其实你们对任何事情的看法都一致
it appears you agree on everything?

496
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:16,850
才不是
No!

497
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,710
是因为这个混蛋竟然以为
It's that this jackass thinks

498
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,970
他真能为《杰说心语》带来新创意
he can actually bring something new to "Jay Talking."

499
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,830
拜托  我们会超神的
Come on! We would be magic!

500
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,220
你已经从我这儿偷走了一家公司
You already stole one company from me.

501
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,380
你这次休想再得逞
You're not getting this.

502
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,350
行  好
Okay, fine!

503
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,570
我要自己弄个节目
I will start my own show.

504
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,270
名字就叫《厄尔智言》
I'll call it... "Earls of Wisdom."

505
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,130
我等不及看了
Can't wait.

506
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,720
评论区见
I'll see you in the comments section.

507
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,230
我会关闭评论功能
I'll just turn the comments off.

508
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,710
-这能实现吗  -能啊
- You can do that? - Yeah.

509
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,200
那我来这里搞什么
Then why am I here?!

510
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,800
你真的不用这么做
Really, you don't have to do this.

511
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,310
如果我不送你来拿钥匙
If I don't drive you to get your keys,

512
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,660
你要怎么开车呢
how are you gonna get your car?

513
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,540
谢谢
Well, thank you.

514
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,570
那就是我家
This is me right here.

515
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,090
不是这里  不是这里  后两间
Not here. Not here. Two down.

516
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,450
我突然有点胃绞痛
Oh, there's a stomach cramp.

517
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,760
好多了  就是那里
Much better. Uh, right here.

518
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,890
邮箱地址"珀特菲尔德"[运输工原野]这家吗
With the mailbox that says "Porterfields"?

519
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,940
是的  这是我们跟邮差开的玩笑  说来话长
Yep. It is a joke that we play with the mailman. Long story.

520
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,290
我很快回来
I will be right back.

521
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,150
喂
Hello?

522
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,300
克莱尔  我是拉
Hey, Claire? It's Ra.

523
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,300
来电显示是"伊拉·巴恩博"
The readout said "Ira Burnbaum".

524
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,690
是的  "拉"是"伊拉"的简称
Yeah. Uh, "Ra" is short for "Ira."

525
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,880
我在想你要不要一起出来
Anyway, I was wondering if you wanted to get together,

526
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,580
洗个澡看个电影什么的
maybe grab a shower and a movie?

527
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,890
不  不
No. No.

528
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,080
我...
Oh, I am...

529
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,300
伊拉  我结婚了  这是不可能的
Ira, I'm a married woman. That's not gonna happen.

530
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,200
我趴在你身上的时候没感受出来
I didn't pick up that energy when I was planking you.

531
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,540
菲尔  你在家做什么
Phil! What are you doing home?

532
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,120
我丢了车钥匙  你在跟谁讲电话
I lost my car keys. Who were you talking to?

533
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,160
-没有谁  为什么你裤子破了 -没有为什么
- Nobody. Why are your pants ripped? - No reason.

534
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,570
找到了  待会见
Here they are. See you later!

535
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,240
你在这
There you are.

536
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,100
我们走吧
Off we go.

537
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,790
Phil  为什么你没让我看这幢房子
Phil, why didn't you show me this house?

538
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,950
它满足我所有的需求
It has everything I want.

539
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,500
我忘了它在待售了
I forgot it was for sale.

540
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,960
你可是中介
You're the agent.

541
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,570
我记起来了  它建得不好
I remember -- It's built cheap.

542
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,680
我觉得挺结实的
It...looks pretty solid to me.

543
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,320
空有其表而已
Well, it's mostly held up by beehives.

544
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:19,970
走吧
Let's go. 

545
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,220
菲尔  到底怎么了
Phil, what is going on?

546
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,690
没什么  只是不想让你住在次品房子里
Nothing. Just trying to keep you away from all that asbestos.

547
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,500
你不想让我当你的邻居吗
Do you not want me as a neighbor?

548
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,630
好吧
Okay.

549
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,300
我坚持不下去了  实话实说吧
I-I can't do this anymore. No more lies.

550
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,120
跟这有关
It is related to that.

551
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,150
我还真不知道你是个种族主义者
I did not peg you for a racist.

552
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,030
等等  不  不  不  不
Wait. No, no, no, no, no!

553
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,140
等等  等等  安吉
Wait, wait, wait. Angie...

554
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,380
世事总是那么难料
It's always the last people you think.

555
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,020
我们结束了  再见  菲尔
We're done. Goodbye, Phil.

556
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,470
不  安吉  不是这样的
No, Angie! That's not it!

557
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,470
我对我妻子撒了谎
I lied to my wife

558
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,260
因为她知道我对黑人有幻想
because she knows I have a thing for black women!

559
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,960
是吗
Oh, really?

560
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,010
嘿
Hey, there!

561
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,410
所以那就是安吉吗
So, that was Angie O'Hara?

562
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,110
好吧
Okay.

563
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,390
我向你坦白
Full disclosure...

564
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,230
我确实说谎了
I did lie.  

565
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,730
但只是因为她很漂亮  而你又有点神经质
But only because she's beautiful and you get a little crazy.

566
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,950
我到底是为什么要这么说
Why the hell did I say that?!

567
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,370
对不起
I'm sorry.

568
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,960
没关系
Oh, it's okay.

569
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,250
你现在那么善解人意  太不像你了
You're being so understanding. It's so unlike you.

570
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,460
你是不是不为人知地疯了
Are you secretly mad?

571
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,040
你是不是在给我安全的错觉
Are you lulling me into a false sense of security?

572
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,460
你是不是要在我睡着的时候对我做什么
Are you gonna do something to me while I'm asleep?

573
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,370
菲尔  你知道真正让我生气的是什么吗
Phil, you know what really gets my goat?

574
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,200
是你说谎了
That you lied.

575
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,520
看来男人都这样
Guess men are men.

576
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,220
不知道为什么我会有奢望
I don't know why I expected anything more.

577
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,380
喂
Hello?

578
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,280
我想给你道歉  你说得对
I want to apologize. You were right.

579
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,880
拉只关心你确实让我生气
It did bother me that Ra gave you all the attention.

580
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,260
他是个有魅力的男人  而你是个非常性感的女人
He's an attractive man, and you're a very sexy woman.

581
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,760
他当然会四处摸你
Of course he put his hands all over you.

582
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,410
-什么  -是拉吗
- What? - Ra?

583
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,460
是菲尔
It's Phil.

584
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,530
再...再见
B-Bye-bye!

585
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,330
克莱尔...
Claire...

586
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,910
你知道真正让我生气的是什么吗
You know what really gets my goat?

587
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,690
好吧  莉莉  开始吧
Okay, Lily. Let's do this.

588
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,290
我们能不能先别骑了
Can we just please give this a rest

589
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,440
等你完全好了再说
until you're fully recovered?

590
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,990
不  米奇尔  我们都陷得太深了
No. Mitchell, we're in too deep.

591
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,450
我摔断了手臂  我还忘了
I have a broken arm, and I can't remember

592
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,810
任何一位小学老师的名字
any of my grade-school teachers' names.

593
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,500
你已经说了四次了
Yeah, you've mentioned that four times now.

594
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
-真的吗  -是的
- Have I really? - Yeah.

595
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,170
好吧  莉莉  上车吧
All right. Uh, Lily, let's -- let's get on the bike.

596
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,210
小心点  小心点
Carefully. Carefully.

597
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,580
一次上一条腿
One leg at a time over.

598
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,440
脚踏在踏板上  很好
Feet on the pedals. Perfect.

599
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,840
然后就开始踩踏板
And then we start pedaling.

600
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,920
米切尔  开始踩踏板
Mitchell, we start pedaling.

601
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,250
好  放手吧
Good. Now let go.

602
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,090
-别放手  -好
- Don't let go! - Okay.

603
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,040
米奇尔  放手
Mitchell, let go.

604
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,070
-我没准备好  -她没准备好
- I'm not ready. - She's not ready!

605
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,980
米切尔  过来一下
Mitchell, sidebar, please.

606
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,680
好的  好的  停下来
Okay. Okay. Stopping.

607
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,460
把脚放下来  我很快回来
Just put your feet down. Be right back.

608
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,630
怎么了  莉莉  你不会骑自行车吗
What's wrong, Lily? Don't you know how to ride a bike?

609
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,680
我会  悉尼  我只是在教他们怎么教小孩
Yeah, Sydney. I'm just showing him how to teach a kid.

610
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,350
我却步不前是因为我摔伤了头
Okay, I'm dragging my feet because I have a brain injury.

611
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,470
你又是为什么
Why are you dragging yours, again?

612
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,170
因为我不想让她受伤
Because I don't want her to get hurt!

613
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,940
她终于开始变得谨慎了
No, see, it's not the worst thing in the world

614
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,790
这并不是什么坏事
that she's actually starting to be cautious.

615
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,720
她以前从书架上飞下来  从秋千上跳下来
She used to fly off of bookcases and jump off of swing sets,

616
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,670
而现在她想保护自己了
and now she's trying to protect herself.

617
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,030
那如果她什么都害怕
And what kind of life is she gonna have

618
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,180
她会拥有怎样的人生呢
if she's scared of everything?

619
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,000
我不需要担心她的人生
A life where I don't have to worry about her.

620
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,330
我懂了
I get it.

621
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,920
所以你才是害怕的那一个
So you're the one that's afraid.

622
