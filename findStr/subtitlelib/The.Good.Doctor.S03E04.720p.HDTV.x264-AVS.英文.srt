20
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,120
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

21
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,920
Message received from Mom.

22
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,170
Hey, baby. I got your text.

23
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,520
We're gonna celebrate. I'll see you soon.

24
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,980
I'm so proud of you, baby!

25
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,450
Here are flowers and chocolates.

26
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,760
Are you asking me out?

27
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,700
Yes.

28
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,900
I would love to.

29
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,700
Will we be doing this during all the commercials?

30
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,170
It's possible.

31
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,180
Patient came in through the celebrity track.

32
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,150
He was admitted through an entrance by the loading dock.

33
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,070
You're not to mention his name even to your colleagues.

34
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,230
What is his name?

35
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,390
Mitchell Stewart.

36
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,330
The conspiracy theorist? That's a celebrity now?

37
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,460
A guy who thinks 9/11 was an inside job?

38
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,600
He's an ass.

39
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,860
He's an ass who needs liver surgery.

40
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,320
Hold it right there.

41
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,960
It's okay, Dex. They're on the list.

42
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,860
Drs. Murphy, Park, Andrews.

43
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,160
Mitchell Stewart.

44
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,980
I don't blindly turn over my well-being,

45
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,540
or anything else, to those in authority,

46
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,880
so I ran background checks on all of you.

47
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,530
Including Nurse Villanueva.

48
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,740
Nurse Villanueva is not a person in authority.

49
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,400
People can be gotten to -- bribed, threatened.

50
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,220
And don't bother trying to hook up that IV

51
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,850
until I know what you want to pump into me.

52
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,160
They're normal IV fluids, Mr. Stewart. Please.

53
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,120
I'm sure you consider whatever you give me

54
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,090
to be normal medical treatment, but we all know

55
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,830
that doctors are pushers in the pay of the drug companies.

56
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,220
The bag contains an isotonic crystalloid

57
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,820
composed of 0.9% sodium chloride dissolved in sterile water.

58
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,260
Also, given that we will soon be

59
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,050
drugging you into unconsciousness

60
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,690
and cutting into your body,

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,040
don't you have to trust us a little?

62
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,910
You must be the autistic guy.

63
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,600
Good. No bull.

64
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,200
Probably doesn't know what bull is.

65
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,820
Bet your parents got one of those combination vaccinations.

66
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,850
Not connected,

67
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,930
because science does not support an autism link.

68
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,550
Yeah, that's what they told you.

69
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,400
Mr. Stewart, suppose we focus on what we'll be doing

70
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,050
to halt the liver damage caused by your genetic condition.

71
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,220
Idiopathic portal hypertension can cause --

72
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,510
My liver is damaged, but that's not the cause.

73
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,020
I've been poisoned.

74
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,940
His internist heard the same theory.

75
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,210
Tox screen came back negative.

76
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,020
And KCNN3 genetic testing confirmed the cause

77
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,070
of his idiopathic portal hypertension.

78
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,090
He inherited it from his mother.

79
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,190
Worth running that tox screen again?

80
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,620
The guy has a Web show where he claims

81
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,470
the parents of children who died in school shootings

82
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,970
are "Crisis actors."

83
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,300
He's earned some enemies.

84
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,700
Once we start doubting the tests,

85
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,090
then you can't trust anything

86
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,590
and there's no point in anything.

87
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,480
We know our patient needs liver shunt surgery.

88
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,750
We're doing the surgery.

89
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,210
You were late.

90
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,600
Your mom keeping you up?

91
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,450
Singing at night again?

92
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,930
No.

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,860
She's been quiet.

94
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,390
Ms. Barstow, I'm Dr. Browne.

95
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,620
This is Dr. Reznick.

96
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,740
What seems to be the trouble?

97
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,980
Nothing much, really.

98
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,060
I feel silly for coming here, but Jonas insisted.

99
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,750
Because you aren't getting any better.

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,690
Lily likes to downplay her problems.

101
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,610
She's the rock, and I'm the wimp.

102
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,340
Ah, fuss, fuss, fuss.

103
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,380
I've just been a little off food for a few days.

104
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,650
You also have a fever.

105
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,210
Most likely, it's an infection.

106
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,410
Oh, my God! Lily!

107
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,170
- Sir, please step back. - Lay back for me.

108
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,580
We're gonna do an ultrasound.

109
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,320
Her pulse is up.

110
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,950
Blood pressure's up, too.

111
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,010
Her appendix is ruptured.

112
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,850
- Oh, my God. - Page anesthesia stat! We're taking her to the O.R.

113
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,970
We need pre-op lab results.

114
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,060
Patient name?

115
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,720
Oh, we can't tell you.

116
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,870
Celebrity track. You'll find the results under the ID number.

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,740
Politics, arts, business?

118
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,720
Is it the President?

119
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,150
I'll give you a hint.

120
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,810
He's less popular.

121
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,930
Well, that's disappointing.

122
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,760
Once we get this cleaned up, we need to figure out

123
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,960
why her brain isn't getting the right distress signals.

124
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,600
How should we go about that, Dr. Browne?

125
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,810
We do an fMRI.

126
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,890
Stimulate her and see how her brain reacts.

127
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,750
Sorry. You asked Claire, but I have lunch plans.

128
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,240
I have a question.

129
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,490
Well, hopefully, it's a quick one.

130
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,740
I've cleared my schedule for the rest of the day.

131
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,650
Debbie and I are going to City Hall

132
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,530
to get married.

133
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,470
Not gonna make a big fuss out of it.

134
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,740
You know, get dressed up, turn it into a big event.

135
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,070
After all, we are not kids anymore.

136
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,050
This is where you say "Congratulations."

137
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,970
Congratulations.

138
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,870
Thank you.

139
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,870
Do you and Debbie hold hands?

140
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,140
Yeah. Why?

141
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,550
Is that what Carly wants to do?

142
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,610
Yes.

143
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,660
She tried twice.

144
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,130
Have you tried to explain why it's difficult for you?

145
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,130
No.

146
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,630
Well, I -- I'd start with that.

147
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,930
How can this be important?

148
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,980
It's a little thing.

149
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,660
Carly and I are compatible on so many big things --

150
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,600
children, geographic preferences,

151
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,530
work priorities, the use of headphones,

152
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,520
potential color schemes for our home --

153
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,770
You have a checklist?

154
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,730
Yes.

155
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,420
Carly and I are still learning about each other.

156
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,200
It's not like you and Debbie.

157
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,350
You already know these things,

158
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,980
or you wouldn't be getting married.

159
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,510
Four?

160
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,290
Five?

161
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,670
I'm feeling some pain.

162
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,790
We can stop.

163
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,660
We're not getting anything.

164
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,700
She's fine.

165
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,040
We need feedback.

166
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,610
Eight.

167
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,220
Nine.

168
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,300
Claire, she's not feeling pain.

169
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,430
The only activity is in the parietal.

170
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,410
Nothing in the limbic,

171
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,710
nothing in the anterior cingulate cortex.

172
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,040
She's feeling touch.

173
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,010
- But why did she just say - My guess

174
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,530
because she's never felt pain.

175
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,000
She doesn't know what it is.

176
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,520
Sleep apnea.

177
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,130
What?

178
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,450
That poor guy over there, I think he's got sleep apnea.

179
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,910
Maybe he's just tired.

180
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,470
It's -- it's one of the most important days of his life,

181
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,040
and he can't stay awake.

182
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,100
Maybe you could -- you could tell him

183
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,460
that there are treatments.

184
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,120
Me?

185
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,650
Otherwise, he's gonna keep his wife awake snoring

186
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,040
for the rest of his life.

187
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,790
It's gonna destroy their marriage.

188
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,610
You seem very sure about that.

189
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,030
There's literally no greater torture

190
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,050
than not getting a good night's sleep.

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,570
All right, first of all, I don't think you mean

192
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,310
literally no greater torture.

193
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,050
Oh, no. It's true.

194
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,870
Once when I was in the Merchant Marine --

195
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,940
Merchant Marines?

196
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
It's -- it's "Marine." No "S."

197
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,860
You were in the Merchant Marines?

198
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,480
And we were stationed off the Azores,

199
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,120
and every night, we were driven crazy

200
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,710
by these loud, just, like, strangled sounds.

201
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,780
Turns out it was just a bunch of cagarro birds.

202
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,460
We were literally hearing the sound

203
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,560
of Daffy Duck drowning.

204
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,650
'Course, that was nothing

205
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,060
compared to what happened in Valparaiso.

206
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,790
Are you okay?

207
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,070
Sorry.

208
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,650
It's just, I -- I'm not feeling so good.

209
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,010
You're not feeling well?

210
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,990
I can't do this.

211
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,440
What?

212
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,370
Is that it?

213
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,160
Are we finished?

214
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,850
Yeah, we're gonna get you out.

215
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,560
Uh, just a couple more questions?

216
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,130
Your mother died age 66 of a heart attack.

217
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,080
Were you there when that happened?

218
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,050
Yes. I called the ambulance.

219
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,930
She died while we were waiting.

220
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,700
Check the anterior cingulate cortex.

221
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,010
Physical pain and emotional pain are processed

222
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,340
through the same areas.

223
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,550
Nothing.

224
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,100
But we don't know how she feels about her mother.

225
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,320
It's your mother.

226
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,350
When she goes, there is a vacuum.

227
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,050
What about your husband?

228
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,860
Has he had any problems lately?

229
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,540
He had a cancer scare about a year ago.

230
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,250
Slight activity here, but it's pretty weak.

231
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,120
You want to argue that she doesn't like her mother

232
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,300
and her husband?

233
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,750
She's like...a superhero.

234
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,540
Nothing can really hurt her.

235
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,050
Is everything okay?

236
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,010
Your right hand is red.

237
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,160
Starting to swell.

238
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,760
What does that mean?

239
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,500
Infection.

240
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,470
Hello.

241
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,880
Your surgery went well.

242
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,760
If there are no delayed complications,

243
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,930
you should be discharged in a few days.

244
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,760
That's great, but what about the big picture?

245
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,310
Once I'm out of here, I'll go back to being poisoned.

246
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,290
You make many statements that have been proven wrong.

247
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,980
Do you really believe them?

248
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,950
You want to untangle what's real and what's for show?

249
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,780
Now you're talking.

250
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:24,940
Okay.

251
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,550
Do you think vaccination damage is being covered up?

252
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,530
Yes.

253
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,530
Do you think

254
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,560
the parents of children killed in school shootings

255
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,410
are "Crisis actors"?

256
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,110
I can't answer for individuals,

257
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,170
but I do believe there's a force in this country

258
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,960
that wants to scam our people

259
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,570
into laying down their arms.

260
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,230
But I no longer think

261
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,060
there's a pedo-slave-ring

262
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,530
in a basement under that pizza joint.

263
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,840
That was a wrong call.

264
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,200
What did you do

265
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,260
when you realized you'd made an error?

266
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,570
Nothing.

267
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,780
No apologies, no admissions.

268
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,840
The second you say you were wrong,

269
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,450
they'll make it seem like everything you know is wrong.

270
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,370
You can't give them that ammunition.

271
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,300
Then you're not really offering the truth.

272
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,140
Maybe if people saw you admit you were wrong,

273
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,770
maybe they'd believe you more.

274
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,270
No.

275
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,420
There is no middle ground.

276
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,650
Compromise is a scam.

277
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,320
When only one side can get what it wants,

278
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,960
make sure it's yours.

279
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,930
We have to surgically remove all infected tissue.

280
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,790
Immediately. Stop it from spreading.

281
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,400
We discovered that Lily can't feel pain,

282
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,420
which is why the appendicitis went untreated,

283
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,090
causing a widespread infection.

284
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,010
I can't...feel pain?

285
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,000
That makes no sense.

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,020
Whatever stimulation your nerves receive,

287
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,740
your brain doesn't acknowledge it as pain.

288
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,020
No, I feel pain.

289
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,770
Do you? Because I'm pinching you.

290
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,630
I feel it.

291
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,640
But you didn't jump or react.

292
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,530
You felt it as a touch.

293
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,070
Physical or emotional pain, it doesn't matter.

294
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,560
Okay, let's go. O.R. 2.

295
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,730
Stop hiding.

296
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,160
I'm not hiding. I'm thinking.

297
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,360
Well, I've done my thinking, and what I've come up with is,

298
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,420
I deserve a better explanation

299
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,900
than "I can't do this."

300
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,410
Because that was humiliating.

301
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,980
I'm sorry.

302
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,710
You're sorry?

303
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,340
What does that mean?

304
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,310
Are we going back tomorrow?

305
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,900
Never? What?

306
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,820
You are the one that proposed to me.

307
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,680
You're the one that told me

308
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,400
how happy our being together makes you.

309
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,350
It makes me happy. It does.

310
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,830
But when I proposed to you,

311
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,570
y-you even said, "I don't know you."

312
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,960
Is -- is that what this is about?

313
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,110
Because I was...

314
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,690
Because I was in the Merchant Marine?

315
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,070
I mean, yes, okay, I -- I -- I --

316
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,230
it makes me wonder what else I don't know about you.

317
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,940
But more importantly, it makes me realize

318
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,810
you don't know anything about me.

319
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,740
I am really annoying.

320
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,330
I'm easily irritable.

321
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,280
Like when people use the word "literally"

322
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,880
about things that aren't literal.

323
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,690
I am impossible to live with.

324
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,980
Maybe literally.

325
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,790
That's been made very clear to me in the past.

326
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,680
I don't want to go two years and get divorced.

327
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,380
Divorcing you would hurt.

328
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,250
Thank you.

329
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,510
But that's a bunch of crap.

330
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,690
You know that, right?

331
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,820
We have different personal styles.

332
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,220
You like to examine things from every angle,

333
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,590
and I -- I like to take a leap into the dark every now and then.

334
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,390
You're right.

335
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,020
I am not a leaper.

336
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,500
I am a toe-dipper.

337
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,110
Takes me two hours to get into the ocean

338
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,450
even when it's warm.

339
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,920
I know that you're good for me.

340
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,060
And I know that I'm good for you, Aaron.

341
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,360
Since meeting me,

342
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,500
you've jumped ship from a comfortable career

343
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,210
because you decided that you were missing something.

344
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,120
And...

345
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,040
you asked a complete stranger

346
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,550
to marry you.

347
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,960
Who knows what's next?

348
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,690
I guess you'll have to keep thinking.

349
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,510
Dr. Browne, widen the debridement.

350
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,360
Extending the incisions proximally.

351
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,750
Her husband thought she was a rock.

352
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,600
Turns out she's a rock

353
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,760
because nothing matters to her.

354
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,310
You're making assumptions.

355
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,840
We were monitoring her reaction to pain.

356
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,830
Love wasn't part of the test.

357
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,320
You care, you hurt.

358
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,490
Maybe not Lily.

359
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,080
She married this man. She stayed with him for years.

360
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,480
Maybe for her, love can exist without the pain of loss.

361
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,260
That would be paradise.

362
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,360
There is way more necrotic tissue here

363
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,580
than I expected.

364
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,870
She's gonna lose the hand.

365
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,610
Well, if anyone can handle bad news...

366
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,620
Are you going to take my hand?

367
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,720
Not right now, no.

368
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,840
I don't like to hold hands.

369
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,520
Either we hold hands or we don't.

370
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,210
There's no compromise.

371
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,990
Only one of us can get what they want.

372
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,340
I guess that's true --

373
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,440
It should be me.

374
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,380
Holding hands makes me uncomfortable.

375
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,200
Not holding hands doesn't make you uncomfortable.

376
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,490
That show we watched the other night --

377
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,020
it had a happy ending.

378
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,310
Because they stopped the story in a good place.

379
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,720
But in real life,

380
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,940
it's gonna get dark and cold out there.

381
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,900
All we have...

382
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,900
is this.

383
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,640
This says we're in it together,

384
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,750
we've got each other's back,

385
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,360
that we'll hold each other up for as long as we can.

386
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,560
I can say all those things verbally.

387
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,130
You could shout them,

388
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,970
and it wouldn't say it as loud as this.

389
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,030
You said that not holding hands wouldn't make me uncomfortable,

390
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,190
but it would.

391
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,370
I would feel...

392
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,470
...separate.

393
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,530
It's all right.

394
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,260
You've actually been lucky,

395
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,310
considering you have no warning system.

396
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,610
You need to be doing self-checks --

397
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,950
knees, feet, elbows, hands.

398
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,070
Look for bruises, discolorations.

399
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,640
Anything at all that changes could be dangerous --

400
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,790
life-threatening.

401
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,510
But there's another option.

402
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,060
Naloxone affects the central nervous system.

403
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,430
It's been shown to block the action

404
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,160
of pain-lowering endorphins.

405
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,470
It could give you the ability to feel pain.

406
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,920
I don't see the point. I've been fine so far.

407
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,770
Guess that sounds a little silly.

408
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,020
I know -- I just lost a hand.

409
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,000
But now I know about checking myself,

410
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,980
and I'll be a lot more careful.

411
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,140
Why is one gesture so important?

412
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,640
Carly still pushing you to hold hands?

413
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,620
No.

414
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,580
I tried, and she said it was all right.

415
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,620
You should give me context for that "Huh."

416
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,150
She wants it.

417
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,600
She's just given up.

418
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,310
Good.

419
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,250
No.

420
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,510
Not if it's gonna bother her

421
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,080
for the rest of your relationship,

422
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,820
which may not be very long.

423
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,710
We need to do imaging to make sure the problem isn't the shunt,

424
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,420
then check there isn't a clot causing backup --

425
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,000
The surgery was a success, but I'm still being poisoned?

426
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,630
No.

427
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,550
The surgery was a success,

428
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,300
but your liver's still deteriorating.

429
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,620
We don't know why.

430
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,430
Jen, check me out of here. Find another hospital.

431
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,770
I can't approve that, Mr. Stewart.

432
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,560
You're in no condition to leave the hospital --

433
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,900
You just confirmed that someone in this hospital is poisoning me.

434
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,980
You want me to cooperate with the suspects?

435
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,930
Another hospital wouldn't solve your problem.

436
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,720
People can be gotten to

437
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,560
bribed or threatened.

438
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,740
Right.

439
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,080
Someone here wants to kill me.

440
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,670
- No one is trying - Let's constrain some of these variables.

441
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,440
One person touches me.

442
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,070
Him.

443
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,920
He doesn't know how to lie.

444
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,010
Oh, I can lie.

445
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,830
Yes, but not successfully. Good choice.

446
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,040
Will I be able to play tennis?

447
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,940
Yes -- eventually.

448
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,670
Funny, I never could before.

449
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,380
You always take things well.

450
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,320
We had to pick up and move from Durham.

451
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,990
Well, that was for your job.

452
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,640
No sense in moping about it.

453
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,140
The miscarriage.

454
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,440
You never talked about it, so...

455
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,530
I never talked about it, I didn't want to hurt you.

456
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,160
But...did you not talk about it

457
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,680
because you just weren't thinking about it?

458
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,580
What are all these questions for?

459
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,770
I thought we were carrying the load together,

460
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,210
knowing how each other felt.

461
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,590
This isn't about us.

462
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,340
This is just... a medical condition.

463
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,180
If I died, would you care?

464
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,310
Would you miss me, or, uh,

465
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,820
would you just... move on?

466
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,760
Would you want me to be miserable?

467
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,920
I want it to matter.

468
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,870
Of course it matters.

469
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,370
You know I love you.

470
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,420
Jonas.

471
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:36,960
Maybe...

472
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,900
you think it's love, but it's like the pain --

473
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,480
it just doesn't go that deep.

474
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,490
But isn't it possible for me to love you

475
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,820
without it being all wrapped up in suffering?

476
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,430
But that's how it works.

477
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,540
When you lose someone, it shouldn't be like your hand.

478
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,690
It should ache.

479
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,860
That's right, isn't it?

480
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,070
That's what loss feels like?

481
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,540
I need to get away for a while.

482
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,760
I'm sorry.

483
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,860
Next, we're going to test you

484
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,850
for autoimmune hepatitis and fatty liver.

485
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,870
Those are diseases whose symptoms overlap yours.

486
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,160
They might have been masked

487
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,610
by your idiopathic portal hypertension.

488
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,130
Nurse Villanueva. Welcome.

489
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,500
But you know I'm not gonna touch that.

490
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,110
The dietician ordered it for you, and I'm required to bring it.

491
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,950
What are you eating if you're refusing hospital food?

492
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,390
80 grams of protein a day.

493
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,170
Kale and baby greens.

494
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,880
"Leopard Spring."

495
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,260
Jen, Dex, you mind stepping out?

496
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,370
It's Chinese herbs.

497
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,020
To make you feel younger, more energetic, more...

498
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,660
virile.

499
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,410
You don't feel virile?

500
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,920
Of course I do, but there's nothing wrong with feeling more virile.

501
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,860
I need strength for the fight.

502
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,830
You're not talking. Is there a problem?

503
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,800
No. These herbs are harmless.

504
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,260
You asked about my virility.

505
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,580
I was curious.

506
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,340
We're going to test you for autoimmune hepatitis and fatty liver.

507
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,340
What's up?

508
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,790
I tested a patient

509
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,340
for autoimmune hepatitis and fatty liver.

510
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,110
What's up with you?

511
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,350
Our patient decided to take the drugs.

512
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,870
Because I guess a husband walking out can make an impression

513
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,310
even on a woman who feels no pain.

514
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,710
That's a lot of paperwork for two tests.

515
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,070
They were negative.

516
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,340
I thought I might find something

517
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,800
in his mother's old records that could help, but no, no.

518
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,720
Her case was straightforward.

519
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,590
His parents were both alcoholics,

520
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,970
but her liver was already weakened by her condition.

521
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,770
Parents both alcoholics?

522
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,790
No wonder he thinks people in authority like to deny the truth.

523
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,360
He's grown up now, Claire.

524
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,430
No longer in that position.

525
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,030
There's still plenty of lying going on in the world.

526
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,010
That's not a situation you outgrow.

527
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,930
Yes.

528
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,230
There is a lot of lying.

529
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,490
Want to hear my theories?

530
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,380
Fight with your mother is number one.

531
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,070
You're debating whether to throw her out.

532
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,260
This theory explains what?

533
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,430
Why the usually compassionate Dr. Claire Browne

534
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,290
envies a woman who feels no pain.

535
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,100
You're miserable, torn.

536
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,090
You don't know what to do to make your own pain go away.

537
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,420
Want to hear my theory?

538
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,260
People that aren't you are doing great,

539
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,800
so you're looking for a toy you can break,

540
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,470
a pet you can torture.

541
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,830
- Is she in pain? - No.

542
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,920
What are her vitals?

543
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,150
Vitals are fine.

544
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,670
Then how can she be in crisis?

545
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,570
I don't know. But she is.

546
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,080
Lily?

547
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,460
Are you okay?

548
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,080
Lily?

549
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,470
I never noticed how ugly the walls are.

550
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,250
I've discovered the cause of your liver problem.

551
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,540
Really? Fatty liver? Autoimmune?

552
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,600
I've never had any symptoms of --

553
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,450
No. You were being poisoned.

554
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,820
What?

555
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,990
Who? Do you know who? How?

556
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,970
I thought maybe the dose of herbs listed on the bottle was wrong --

557
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,220
There's a toxic dose in there?

558
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,680
No. There are no herbs at all in here.

559
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,710
It contains sildenafil.

560
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,560
It's the active element in Viagra.

561
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,760
It promotes blood flow in your penis.

562
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,760
I know what it does.

563
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,320
They say it's natural herbs.

564
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,480
They lied.

565
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,200
Your idiopathic portal hypertension

566
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,170
means your liver is vulnerable to abuse.

567
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,300
The amount of sildenafil in here wouldn't kill most people,

568
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,630
but if someone with pre-existing liver issues

569
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,200
took it every day...

570
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,910
You were right.

571
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,290
You've been poisoning yourself.

572
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,750
It's good news.

573
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,920
Those Communist bastards.

574
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,090
I think they're based in San Pedro.

575
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,550
Mr. Barstow.

576
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,070
Is Lily all right?

577
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,950
She's on medication to reverse her pain-free condition,

578
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,790
but it's hit her hard.

579
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,620
She's being wrung out by all the negative thoughts and feelings

580
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,190
the rest of us have all built calluses against.

581
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,040
But she made the right choice?

582
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,780
I mean, she needs this to be safe.

583
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,960
I don't think she's doing this to be safe.

584
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,410
I think she's doing this because you walked out.

585
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,500
Why?

586
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,160
You were happy for years.

587
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,040
Now you're sure you can't be happy unless your wife changes?

588
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,880
I want her to feel everything I feel.

589
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,340
The love, the pain, everything. Wouldn't you?

590
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,450
The residents in this hospital work long hours. You know why?

591
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,990
Because the surgeons in charge worked long hours

592
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,200
when they were residents.

593
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,810
They suffered, so we have to suffer. It's human nature.

594
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,750
- What does that -- - But someone like your wife,

595
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,830
so invulnerable,

596
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,250
it's -- it's like she's gotten away with something.

597
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,920
It's hard not to resent her.

598
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,170
Sure, we want to "cure" her,

599
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,090
but how much of it is -- is to give her a warning system,

600
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,050
and how much is because

601
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,200
we want to pull her down into hell with the rest of us?

602
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,060
Are you married now?

603
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,600
No.

604
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,230
I chickened out.

605
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,870
Apparently, I don't like change.

606
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,770
Change makes me very nervous.

607
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,320
I'm not the easiest man in the world to live with.

608
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,630
My first wife made that very clear.

609
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,910
It's true.

610
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,620
You can be very irritating.

611
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,000
Are you saying I shouldn't get married?

612
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,670
Are you asking for my advice?

613
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,760
Yes.

614
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,220
You've never really asked before.

615
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,740
And this is an important decision.

616
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,980
Your happiness depends on it.

617
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,020
This is huge.

618
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,780
Well?

619
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,300
I don't have any advice.

620
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,320
I don't even understand the issue.

621
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,340
I also don't understand why you asked

622
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,330
when you've already made up your mind.

623
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,500
What?

624
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,480
You usually call her your ex-wife.

625
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,020
You just called her your "first."

626
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,500
It implies a second.

627
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,850
Why are you staring in your trunk?

628
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,600
Something in here the answer to your problem?

629
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,710
Yoga mat...

630
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,940
gym bag..

631
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,030
extra sneakers...

632
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,530
Here's a little earthquake kit.

633
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,670
So sensible.

634
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,990
Dirty towel.

635
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,990
- What's this? - Put it back.

636
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,170
It's my mom.

638
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,410
Why are you jumping?

639
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,790
I'm not jumping. I'm leaping.

640
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,580
Come on. Come leap with me.

641
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,000
We both can't leap on that thing.

642
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,090
Are you okay?

643
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,970
Never better.

644
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,560
Will you leap with me...

645
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,640
to City Hall?

646
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,270
Yes, I will.

647
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,400
Also, I may have done something to my ankle.

648
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,790
Do you want me to... call someone --

649
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,780
Shouldn't regret nothing, baby.

650
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,680
I left the champagne

651
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,870
because I was so ready for victory.

652
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,170
Now I don't even know what to do with the damn ashes.

653
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,430
Leave them on a shelf in the closet with the spare towels?

654
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,470
Put them down the disposal?

655
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,070
What did she want done with them?

656
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,140
It was stupid. I'm sure she was joking.

657
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,180
Yeah, everyone jokes in their will.

658
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,810
The Marine Science Center.

659
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,030
She loved sea lions.

660
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,250
She'd take me to see them all the time. It was a thing.

661
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,820
Any city we were in, "I wonder if they have sea lions."

662
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
You need to do it. Now.

663
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,080
No. No.

664
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,260
It is a pointless gesture

665
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,500
because my mother is dead and she doesn't care.

666
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,210
Perfect. The center's open this evening for an after-hours event.

667
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,010
We'll have to dress up.

668
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,530
The winner of tonight's vote for Most Fabulous Sea Creature,

669
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,890
the vampire squid!

670
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,420
I feel ridiculous!

671
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,460
You look great.

672
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,960
You could give the vampire squid a run for her money.

673
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,950
Now let's find the sea lions.

674
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,380
You came back.

675
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,340
Yeah.

676
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,850
Thank God.

677
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,190
We'll stop this.

678
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,900
It'll be all right.

679
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,780
Doctor, you got to get this stuff out of her IV.

680
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,580
You don't need it.

681
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,200
If you have to be careful about getting hurt,

682
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,790
I'll be there to help you.

683
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,420
The "stuff" was removed some time ago.

684
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,940
Before Dr. Browne went off-shift,

685
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,900
she told me that Lily was experiencing some problems.

686
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,590
So I thought it best to discontinue the medication for a while.

687
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,800
She's as she was when you left her.

688
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,770
You never cry.

689
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,570
When I saw you sitting there,

690
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,070
I've never been so happy in my whole life.

691
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,710
I thought you didn't want to "make a fuss."

692
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,510
Yeah.

693
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,590
Who knew?

694
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,840
This seems weird.

695
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,430
It is weird.

696
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,780
Most people have some kind of ritual all ready for them

697
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,810
so they don't have to think about this kind of stuff.

698
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,520
You got a prayer?

699
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,020
I'm not religious.

700
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,520
Neither was my mom.

701
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,860
Everybody has a religion.

702
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,240
Not everybody has a god, but everybody has a religion.

703
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,460
Music.

704
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,710
Your mother's religion was music.

705
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,420
Sing.

706
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,350
By the sea lion colony at a drag pride party?

707
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,140
Or you can just dump it out and feel weird.

708
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,440
Your call.
