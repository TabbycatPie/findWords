00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,000
I just realized I don't ever
wanna go back in there again.

178
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,958
[man] "Come to me,

179
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,458
all who are weary and burdened,
and I will give you rest."

180
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,166
"Take my yoke upon you,

181
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:19,875
and learn from me,

182
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,875
for I am gentle and humble at heart."

183
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
Mrs. Deardorff isn't here.

184
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,833
-[priest continues indistinctly]
-None of them are.

185
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,000
Deardorff fell and broke her hip.

186
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,500
Right after you left.

187
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,916
She had to walk with a cane after.

188
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:35,916
Was never the same.

189
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,541
Made me almost believe in God.

190
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,333
[priest] I didn't know William Shaibel,

191
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,583
but I'm told he was not a religious man,
so much as a solitary man.

192
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,500
[Beth] None of them are crying.

193
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,583
[priest]
And I'm told that for the past 23 years…

194
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,458
[Jolene] They all look like
they're waiting in line at the bank.

195
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,958
-[priest] …Methuen Home for girls…
-You okay?

196
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,125
-[priest] He performed his duties…
-I feel bad.

197
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,583
…quietly and diligently.

198
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,291
I owed him ten dollars.

199
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,875
-[suppressed laughter, clearing throat]
-[woman] Shh!

200
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,791
Jolene.

201
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,083
[priest] The director of the Methuen Home,
Helen Deardorff, says that…

202
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,708
he was beloved by the staff
and students alike,

203
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,208
that he had an admirable work ethic.

204
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,208
I changed my mind.

205
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,416
I'll only be a minute.

206
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,166
[girls singing hymn in Latin]

207
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:53,666
[door closes]

208
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,625
-[door locking]
-[keys jangling]

209
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,250
You should be in chapel, young lady.

210
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,208
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,708
[singing continues in Latin]

212
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,708
[inhales sharply]

213
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
[emotional orchestral music playing]

214
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,250
[Jolene] Beth?

215
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,875
[sobbing]

216
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,375
Oh, honey.

217
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,791
Aw, did you bite off
more than you can chew?

218
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,125
Aw, it's okay.

219
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,166
[sobbing continues]

220
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,958
[Jolene] Shh. It's all right.

221
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,083
What we would really like
from you, Elizabeth,

222
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,208
would be some kind of statement.

223
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:08,958
Statement?

224
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:13,083
Christian Crusade would like you
to make your position public,

225
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,208
in a world where so many keep silent.

226
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,041
What position is that?

227
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,166
As we know, the spread of communism

228
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,708
is also the spread of atheism.

229
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:26,833
I suppose so.

230
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,666
Oh, it's not a matter of supposing.

231
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:33,041
It's a matter of fact,
of Marxist-Leninist fact.

232
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,500
The Holy Word is anathema to the Kremlin,

233
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,166
and the atheists who sit there.

234
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,958
-I have no quarrel with that.
-[woman] Good.

235
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,791
What we want
is a statement to that effect.

236
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,541
-To the press?
-[woman] Exactly.

237
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,000
We had something prepared. There you go.

238
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,708
I'm a chess player.

239
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,916
Of course you are.
But you're also a Christian.

240
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,458
I'm not sure about that.

241
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,416
I have no intention
of saying anything like this.

242
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,833
-Why not?
-Because it's fucking nonsense?

243
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:16,500
Christian Crusade
has already invested a good deal of money.

244
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,625
We paid
for your last trip to San Francisco.

245
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,291
We were all very proud of you.

246
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:26,000
And we've already spent a good deal more
on your upcoming trip to the Soviet Union.

247
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:26,916
Okay.

248
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,541
Fine.

249
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,041
I'll give it all back.

250
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,500
[pen clicks]

251
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,541
[pen writing]

252
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,666
I hope you know what you're doing, dear.

253
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,083
[Benny] Oh, it's official now.

254
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,000
You're crazy.

255
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,375
You are out of your fucking mind.

256
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,125
[Beth] Maybe. Probably.

257
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,375
But I did it,
and it's too late to undo it.

258
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,333
-Are the tickets paid for?
-No.

259
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,166
Nothing's paid for.

260
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,166
You understand you gotta pay Intourist
for the hotel in advance?

261
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,125
I know that.

262
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,125
I have 2,000 in my bank account.

263
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,458
It would be more,
but I've been keeping up the house.

264
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,625
It's gonna take a thousand more
to do it, at least that.

265
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,708
-I was wondering--
-I don't have it.

266
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,875
What do you mean? [blows]

267
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,625
-You've got money.
-I don't have it.

268
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,666
Did you gamble it all away?

269
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,208
What difference does it make?

270
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,875
You can call the Federation
or the State Department.

271
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,041
The Federation doesn't like me.

272
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,458
They think I haven't done as much
for chess as I could've.

273
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,416
Should have gone on Tonight,
Phil Donahue…

274
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,791
Benny, come on.
I don't wanna go to Russia by myself.

275
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,375
[exhales slowly]

276
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,916
-Benny?
-Are you kidding me?

277
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,708
-What?
-First, you don't come back to New York,

278
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,041
and you basically tell me

279
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,125
that you'd rather be a drunk
than be with me.

280
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:04,916
Now you pull this crap?

281
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No, you can fucking well go alone.

282
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,833
Maybe I shouldn't have done it.

283
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,541
Maybe I didn't have
to give the money back.

284
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,041
Maybe? Maybe is a loser's word, Beth.

285
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,833
-Benny…
-Don't call me anymore.

286
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,833
-[phone hangs up]
-[dial tone]

287
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,500
[man on phone] What money the Federation
has comes from the magazine.

288
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,750
Four hundred dollars
is the most we could possibly spare.

289
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,000
[racquetball thudding]

290
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,666
[Muzak playing through phone]

291
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,750
-[woman] State Department, please hold.
-[inhales]

292
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,791
-[Beth] Thought you said you could play.
-[Jolene] I said I'm learning.

293
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,333
[Muzak playing through phone]

294
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,333
-Cultural Affairs, O'Malley speaking.
-[Beth] Hello?

295
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,958
[Beth screaming] Oh, my God, I won!
[squealing]

296
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,708
[O'Malley whistles]
Three thousand dollars?

297
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,125
[Beth] Yes, straight away.

298
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,708
I'll see what I can do.

299
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,333
-I'll get back to you in an hour.
-An hour?

300
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,875
[Muzak playing through phone]

301
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,083
[O'Malley] No dice.

302
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,833
I'm terribly sorry.

303
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,000
There's no way government funds
can be handed out to you

304
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,333
without more time and approval.

305
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,875
Don't you have some petty cash
or something?

306
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,291
I don't need funds
to undermine the government in Moscow.

307
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,208
I just need…

308
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,875
money for my trip.

309
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,416
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,

310
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,166
but we will be sending
one of our men with you.

311
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:43,625
Keep you safe.

312
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:45,958
Keep me safe?

313
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:50,083
-I shouldn't have bought the house.
-Or all those dresses.

314
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,166
Three thousand is a lot.

315
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,333
It's expensive to go to Moscow.

316
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,250
I'll give it to you.

317
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,375
What?

318
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,416
No, you just said it's a lot of money.

319
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,875
I have it and more. I've been saving.

320
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,958
You need it for law school.

321
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:15,875
I do.

322
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,000
And you'll give it back…

323
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,833
when you win.

324
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:21,958
What if I don't win?

325
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:23,958
It's still worth it.

326
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,000
Or you could give me the black dress.

327
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:32,250
-Or the purple one. I like them both.
-[laughing]

328
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:38,916
You're like…

329
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,041
my guardian angel.

330
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,250
For crying out loud.

331
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,208
Hey, Beth.

332
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:47,791
Fuck you.

333
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:52,458
Shaibel isn't the only one
who kept after you all these years.

334
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:57,000
I know how you lost to Benny Watts
in Vegas and then beat him in Ohio.

335
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,458
I read the papers.

336
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,666
Even on a group trip into town,
I spent my ice cream money

337
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,208
on the damn chess magazine
had your ugly face on it.

338
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,416
For a time,

339
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,875
I was all you had.

340
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,750
And for a time,

341
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,250
you was all I had.

342
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,666
We weren't orphans.

343
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:27,000
Not as long as we had each other.
You understand what I'm saying?

344
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,291
I'm not your guardian angel.

345
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,625
I'm not here to save you.

346
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,791
Hell, I can barely save me.

347
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,041
I'm here because you need me to be here.

348
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,125
That's what family does.

349
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,583
That's what we are.

350
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,958
Someday, I might need you.

351
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,666
It's doubtful.

352
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,125
[laughing] But you never know.

353
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,083
But if I do…

354
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,083
you'll come, won't you?

355
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,541
I might.

356
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,708
[laughs]

357
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,541
[passengers speaking indistinctly]

358
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,791
[liquid pouring]

359
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,333
You been to Russia before?

360
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:31,750
Have you?

361
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,625
Once or twice.

362
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,041
There's a few rules.

363
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:44,791
One, stay in your hotel
at all times unless you're with me.

364
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:48,333
Two, do not answer your door
or your phone, unless it's me.

365
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,666
How will I know it's you
if I don't answer it?

366
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,333
Three,

367
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:53,750
no drinking.

368
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,500
You just offered me a drink.

369
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:58,625
That was a test.

370
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,791
Let me know if any of the Russian players
tries to speak with you.

371
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,083
In particular, Vasily Borgov.

372
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,916
He sends a signal in any way,
or sends a note,

373
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,333
I wanna know immediately.

374
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,958
What exactly would a signal look like?

375
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,166
Could be anything.

376
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:21,250
-He could do it in one of your matches.
-How?

377
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,000
I don't know.

378
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,291
I don't play chess.

379
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,541
Just be on the lookout.

380
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,833
I'm told they may wanna talk.

381
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,333
Talk about what?

382
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:42,625
What part of the State Department
did you say you were from again?

383

385
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,833
[man 1, in Russian]
That the chess player?

386
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,666
She looks like Ann-Margret.

387
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,625
[engine turns over]

388
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,333
[man 2]
Let's hope the Russians like redheads.

389
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,333
[man 2 speaking Russian]

390
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,000
[anticipatory orchestral music playing]

391
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,125
[in English]
This is definitely better than mine.

392
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,916
Remember, stay in your room at all times.

393
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,083
Do not leave the hotel
unless you're with me.

394
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,250
I'll get you in the morning.

395
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,208
Will you knock two times fast
and one time slow?

396
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,000
Good one.

397
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:28,625
Welcome to Russia.

398
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,625
[dramatic string music playing]

399
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:34,583
[door closes]

400
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,166
Yes.

401
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,750
This will do nicely.

402
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:53,875
[in Russian]
In the words of Thomas Huxley,

403
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:56,166
"The chessboard is the world,

404
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,541
the pieces are
the phenomena of the Universe,

405
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:01,000
the rules of the game

406
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,416
are what we call the laws of Nature,

407
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,458
and the player on the other side

408
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,958
is hidden from us."

409
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,791
[tournament director]
Ladies and gentlemen, dear comrades,

410
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:18,708
please welcome…

411
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,291

Thank you.

-[buttons clicking]
-[thrilling music playing]

427
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,833
[commentator 1, in English] As far as
they knew, Harmon wasn't at their level.

428
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,458
Someone like Laev

429
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,208
probably didn't spend a lot of time
preparing for their match.

430
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:03,083
Elizabeth Harmon's not at all
an important player by their standards.

431
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:06,583
The only unusual thing about her,
really, is her sex.

432
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:10,166
And even that's not unique in Russia.
There's Nona Gaprindashvili,

433
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,916
but she's the female world champion
and has never faced men.

434
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,666
My guess is
Laev was expecting an easy win,

435
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,125
and not at all the 27-move thrashing
Beth Harmon just gave him.

436
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:31,041
[crowd applauding]

437

[crowd clamoring in Russian]

438
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:45,833
[in English] Um, yeah.

[Beth] Um… [chuckles]

448
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,000
[in English] Yeah? Okay.

449
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:54,916
Um…

[crowd cheering loudly]

451
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:04,125
[commentator 1] Beth Harmon's games
with Hellstrom and Shapkin were rigorous,

452
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:07,041
and I'm sure,
for the young American, rather exhausting.

453
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:10,333
But there was a solidity
to her opening moves

454
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:12,625
that she was able to maintain
through the middlegame,

455
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:15,041
and on to the point each of them resigned.

-[opponent grunts]
-[chair clatters]

457
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,958
[commentator 1] Hellstrom, it must
be said, clearly took it rather hard.

458
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,750
Didn't speak to Harmon afterwards.

459

[crowd applauding]

460
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,083
[commentator 1] Shapkin, however,
was very decent, very civilized,

461
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,458
and took his loss with grace,

462
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:42,666
even though Harmon's win over him
was decisive and merciless.

463

[gentle piano music playing]

469
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:42,000
[commentator 1, in English]
Luchenko's the oldest player here,

470
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:44,416
was World Champion
before Elizabeth Harmon was born.

471
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,875
He defeated the great Alekhine
in an exhibition when he was a boy,

472
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:51,416
played to a draw with Botvinnik
and crushed Bronstein in Havana.

473
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,000
And while he's no longer
the tiger he once was,

474
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:56,875
he's a dangerous player
when allowed to attack.

475
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:59,291
Harmon will have to be very careful.

I don't understand.
Did we win, or did we lose?

480
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,333
We adjourned.

481
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,625
-Meaning?
-[crowd continues chanting "Harmon"]

482
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,166
Meaning we didn't finish.

483

-[car door closes]
-So, uh…

484
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,041

-[engine turns over]
-Tomorrow.

486
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,750
But right now, we really need some sleep.

[Borgov] He takes back.

495
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,208
[man] But then she takes his rook.

496
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,750
[Borgov] So what? He's got h5.

497
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,333
[Luchenko] Yes, that's a nasty pin.

498
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,166

[chess clock ticking]

505
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,041
Harmon had her 90 minutes of play,
and Luchenko had the same,

506
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,791
along with 35 minutes
he had left from the day before.

507
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:00,625
This put three things against her.

508
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,666
Luchenko having the white pieces,

509
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,666
his still unstopped attack…

510
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,125
and that extra allotment of time.

511
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,916
So, it was all the more impressive

512
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,625
when she beat him with 25 minutes
still on her clock.

513
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:26,791
Excellent.

514
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,708
What a brilliant recovery.

515
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:34,041
I resign with relief.

516
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,541
I've played your games
since I was a small girl.

517
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,833
I've always really admired you.

518
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:41,625
You are how old again?

519
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,291
-I'm twenty--
-Oh, no. Don't tell me.

520
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,416
It will only drive a stake
through my heart.

521
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,708
[laughs]

522
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:52,000
I went over your games
at this tournament.

523
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,666
You are a marvel, my dear.

524
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:01,875
I may have just played
the best chess player of my life.

525
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:06,958
You will get used to it.

526
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,041

527
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:12,666
Thank you.

[crowd clamoring in Russian]

529
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,166
[commentator 1] So far, Harmon
is proving to be the biggest attraction

530
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,500
since the Youth Festival in 1957.

531
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:30,875
Some in Moscow are even calling her
an ambassador of sorts.

532
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:33,666
This evening she played
the English opening against Flento,

533
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:37,208
a sequence I've always found
to be like the Sicilian in reverse.

534
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:38,458
He's nowhere near her level,

535
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,375
and I don't think she expected
the game to go on for nearly four hours.

536
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,541
But Flento put up quite a fight
along the two main diagonals,

537
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,625
and played the Four Knights Variation
with a sophistication that looked,

538
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:51,375
for a while at least,
like it was far beyond Harmon's.

539
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:55,916
But by the middlegame,
she'd traded herself out of that position,

540
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,958
and ultimately forced Flento to resign.

541
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,125
The result being

542
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:04,250
she could come to her match
with Borgov tomorrow, exhausted.

543
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:05,250

[Paul] You shouldn't have brought her.
Why did you bring her here?

549
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,000
-Because I need your help!
-It's too late!

550
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,291
-[young Beth] Who was that?
-[Alice] A mistake.

551
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:40,083
A-A rounding error.

552
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,833
It's just a problem I gotta solve.

553
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,416
[young Beth] What problem?

554
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,291
[sighs]

555
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:51,625
What I do with you.

569
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:27,958
Harmon plays pawn to Queen Bishop four.

The Queen's Gambit.

Borgov declines,

572
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:35,375
moves pawn to King four.

573
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:39,750
[commentator 1, in English] Borgov's
second move is a bit of a surprise.

574
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,833
Normally, Borgov would do
something more solid,

575
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:45,833
but here, he's going against his own style
and playing a rare line to win.

576
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,708
He must win.

577
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:50,250
Harmon's response
was a complete deviation from the Albin,

578
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,916
which must've surprised him right back,

579
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,125
whilst allowing her
to get out into the open.

580
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:58,416
Now, the two of them can fight it out
from here with their own wits.

Don't be like that.

It'd be good to talk to them.

Tell them that being in Russia
has made you feel lucky to be an American.

[reporters yelling] Ms. Harmon!
One question!

607
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:10,166
Hi, Dick Evans from Time.
Do you have a minute?

608
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,666
That depends.
Will you put me on the cover?

609
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,708
-Hmm. Are you going to beat him?
-I haven't made any mistakes so far.

610
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:16,666
Hm. Neither has he.

611
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,791
Is it true you learned how to play
at an orphanage when you were two?

612
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:22,125
-I was nine.
-Such a young age. Who taught you?

613
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,000
His name was Shaibel.

614
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:27,541
William Shaibel.

615
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:30,000
He was a janitor.
We played in the basement.

616
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:32,625
-The janitor taught you to play chess?
-[Beth] That's right.

617
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:34,833
William Shaibel was a fine player.

618
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:37,375
He spent a lot of time at it,
and he was quite good.

619
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:40,458
Now, will you please
promise to print that?

620
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,125
Absolutely. Thank you.

621
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:43,208
Yes, yes. Sure.

622
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:45,291
Thank you.
If you'll excuse me, I'm very tired.

How did you even get a visa so fast?

The newspaper helped me.

630
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:11,875
I'm an associate editor now.

631
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:14,541
And the Moscow Embassy.

632
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:16,500
-Really?
-Yeah.

633
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:18,666
I'm guessing
they thought I'd distract you.

635
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,250
If they only knew.

636
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:26,708
I know you were angry with me.

637
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:29,666
And I'm sorry.

638
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:32,666
I should've told you the whole story.

639
00:49:33,416 --> 00:49:34,250
No.

640
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:35,958
I'm sorry.

641
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,083
I should have let you.

642
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:42,708
I will admit…

643
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:44,416
I was a little…

644
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,000
confused.

645
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:50,875
You really are something.

646
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:55,916
But, um, what I really wanted
was for us to be friends.

647
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:00,541
And you kind of broke my heart.

648
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,250
I have a way of doing that.

649
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:08,666
Do you forgive me?

650
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:12,708
Clearly.

00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,541

Consider me your second. What do we need
to do to help you beat Borgov?

654
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:26,291
Well, what I need are…

655
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:29,708
the pills.

656
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:34,000
The booze. I need my mind cloudy to win.

657
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:37,208
-I can't visualize the games without them.
-Really?

658
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:40,833
-You think that's what brought you here?
-I think that's what I'm used to.

659
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:43,250
Yeah, but you've been doing fine
without all that.

660
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,291
-Haven't you?
-Yes, I…

661
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:49,333
threw away the pills.

662
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:53,125
And then I asked the front desk
where I could get more. [chuckles]

663
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,875
I just really need them right now.

664
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:57,625

All right. Hey, assholes,
this is costing me a bundle.

698
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:03,333
Beth, listen to me,
you gotta open up that file, okay?

699

[sighs] How do I do that?

700
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:08,583
There are four ways,
depending on what he does,

701
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:10,500
and we've each been working a way through.

702
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,125
You have it handy?

703
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,375
[chuckles]

704
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:15,833
Yes, I do. Yes.

705
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:19,000
Great, okay. Well, let's start
with his knight to rook four.

706
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,750
We push that king knight pawn.
You got that?

707
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,916
-Yes.
-Great. I'll pass you back to Harry.

708
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:26,583
[Harry] There are three things
you might do now.

709
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:28,583
So, after the queen to knight three,

710
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:30,666
you play knight to king six,

711
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,125
then if he plays rook to rook five,
then you play pawn to king three.

712
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:40,416
Another variation: If he plays
knight takes pawn on king five,

713
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,833
then you take the rook.

714
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:44,333
But if he plays rook to rook seven,

715
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:46,833
check, then play rook to bishop two.

716
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:51,500
[crowd chanting] Harmon! Harmon!
Harmon! Harmon!

717
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:54,250
Harmon! Harmon! Harmon!

718
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,291
[Beth] Benny?

719
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,125
It's almost five here.

720
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:00,666
Okay.

721
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,250
Go beat him.

722
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,875
[suspenseful music playing]

723
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:17,708
[commentator 2, in Russian]
Borgov withdraws his queen to G6.

-[piece clatters]

725
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:27,625

727
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:41,791
Borgov attacks Harmon’s king-pawn.

[whispering] Shit.

737
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:28,625
-He's not doing what he's supposed to do.
-Shh!

738
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:32,291
[inhales deeply]

739
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,500
[exhales slowly]

740
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:40,333
[pensive music playing]

741
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,791
[music transitions to exciting]

742
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:39,500
[music intensifies]

743
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:51,291
[button clicks]

744
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,125
Draw?

745
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:34,916
Borgov never offers draws,
but he's offering Elizabeth Harmon one.

746
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,333
If she accepts,

747
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:39,458
she leaves the stage in a tie
with the world champion.

748
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:40,791
If they play on,

749
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,875
once the dust settles
and the endgame emerges,

750
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:45,083
she could find herself
in a very different position.

751
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:47,333
Borgov is death on endgames.

752
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:48,625
He's famous for it.

753
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:50,583
Harmon, on the other hand, is not.

754
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:52,916
She's more known
for coming up early and strong,

755
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,083
demoralizing her opponents from the start.

756
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:57,416
So, I think she should accept the draw.

757
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,291
The world will see it
as a solid achievement.

758
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:02,541
A draw, however, is not a win.

759
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:06,125
The one thing
we know about Elizabeth Harmon

760
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:07,500
is that she loves to win.

761
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:16,333

764

[commentator 1] That was
the point of the sequence,

765
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:49,250
beginning with the bishop,
cutting down the scope of the rook

766
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:51,166
by forcing it to a less threatening rank.

767
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,333
-[overlapping Russian commentary]
-The question is…

768
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:55,041
what will she do now?

She won!

[all yelling and laughing joyously]

780
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,583
Thank you.

Good for you, cracker.

784
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:13,375
Good for you.

785
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:16,541
Mm.

[bodyguard] The president has invited you
to the White House.

789
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:56,166
There'll be a chess board
set up in the Oval Office,

790
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,708
and, of course,
a photo-op of you kicking his ass.

791
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,625
Texas being more of a checkers state.

792
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:09,250
And there's a dinner tonight
at the Russian Chess Club in Georgetown.

793
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:12,291
A lot of prominent dissidents belong, so…

794
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:14,958
we've prepared a list of talking points.

795
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:20,250
It's a big deal.

796
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,666
Beating the Soviets at their own game.

797
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,791
Could you stop the car, please?

798
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,041
I'd like to walk.

799
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,875

Liza Harmon?

806
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:45,750
Da.

807
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:49,375
