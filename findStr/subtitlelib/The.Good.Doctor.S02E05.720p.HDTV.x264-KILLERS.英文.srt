20
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,840
We should not live together.

21
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,110
That makes no sense.

22
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,530
I rented that apartment,

23
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,190
and neither of us can afford it on our own.

24
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,480
It has a fireplace.

25
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,830
We shouldn't live together.

26
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,580
It has a fireplace.

27
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,650
Do you ever think about us

28
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,930
being together...

29
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,610
as a couple?

30
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,840
Sometimes.

31
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,030
I don't want that.

32
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,070
You don't want us to be a couple?

33
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,900
Or you don't want me thinking about us as a couple?

34
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,700
Neither.

35
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,370
If we get an apartment together,

36
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,670
I feel like that's a signal

37
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,440
that you and I might end up as boyfriend and girlfriend,

38
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,900
and that's not going to happen.

39
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,390
You can't predict the future.

40
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,230
Feelings change.

41
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,520
I used to hate hugs, but now...

42
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,850
sometimes I don't.

43
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,810
But I don't want my feelings to change.

44
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,360
I like being your friend,

45
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,450
and romantic relationships a-are unpredictable.

46
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,500
So much can go wrong, especially when I am involved.

47
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,180
And if we live together, it's gonna be awkward.

48
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,160
You're bound to walk in on me when I'm naked

49
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,630
or hear the weird sex sounds I make with some out-of-work drummer

50
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,240
or find me crying - when that drummer dumps me,

51
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,020
even though I was totally gonna dump him.

52
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,330
I was so unhappy

53
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,200
when we weren't getting along.

54
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,360
You were, too, right?

55
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,050
Yes.

56
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,930
Anything that puts our friendship at risk isn't worth it to me.

57
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,040
Okay, Shaun?

58
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,390
Yes.

59
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,660
Our gallbladder removal's off.

60
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,220
Patient took an Ambien last night,

61
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,820
woke up eating a roast chicken.

62
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,910
Let's check the consult list

63
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,510
for something a little more interesting.

64
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,370
- See? Gallbladders are boring. - You're a resident.

65
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,250
You don't get to call any surgery boring.

66
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,200
See?

67
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,850
This is interesting.

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,270
Fizzy urine.

69
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,390
42-year-old female, syncopal episode

70
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,940
with persistent loss of consciousness.

71
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,140
On the ride, she went into PVT, rate of 180.

72
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,030
We shocked her back to normal sinus rhythm.

73
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,150
I'm starting to feel...

74
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,040
She's going back into PVT.

75
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,160
- We need to shock her. Get her into a bay. - No. No.

76
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,170
That was cool, but you may have just cracked her sternum.

77
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,110
- Get her into bay 2. - What happened?

78
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,270
- You're her husband? - Yes.

79
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,090
Your wife is pretty frail.

80
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,810
Any idea what could have caused that?

81
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:11,940
She did.

82
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,650
She's anorexic.

83
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,670
I'm Dr. Murphy. This is Dr. Park.

84
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,180
We're here about your urine.

85
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,070
How long has it been fizzy?

86
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,300
I hadn't even noticed. Is that a problem?

87
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,410
Ah, it can be a symptom of several conditions,

88
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,740
many of them minor.

89
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,420
You're here for ortho -- a scope on your right knee?

90
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,000
It's been sore. I've been training for a race.

91
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,270
Joint pain plus fizzy urine.

92
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,980
You could have emphysematous cystitis,

93
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,550
bladder cancer, kidney problems --

94
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,340
Those sound serious. Should I call my husband?

95
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,440
Emphysematous cystitis is a treatable bladder infection.

96
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,320
Your symptoms could also be from a kidney stone

97
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,520
or dehydration.

98
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,750
Could my issues be caused by...

99
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,540
gastric bypass surgery?

100
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,380
It depends. When was it?

101
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,680
15 years ago.

102
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,430
I used to be 377 pounds.

103
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,530
That's a lot.

104
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,600
Your surgery wouldn't cause those symptoms,

105
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,530
but we need to do a cystoscopy to find out what did.

106
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,090
I'll cancel the ortho and get Lim to sign off.

107
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,430
Hey, wait. What --

108
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,590
So, what is a cystoscopy?

109
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,850
It's like a knee scope,

110
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,500
except the camera goes up your penis.

111
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,140
You administered amiodarone?

112
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,940
Rhythm's normal.

113
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,320
That's good, right?

114
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,520
It's better than when you came in.

115
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,850
Your heart is failing

116
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,430
as a result of a condition called mitral regurgitation.

117
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,600
One of your valves isn't closing all the way.

118
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,340
Blood keeps leaking back into your atrium.

119
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,410
That's why you fainted

120
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,550
and why we need to repair that valve ASAP.

121
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,240
How long have you been anorexic?

122
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,350
I've had issues with food on and off since I  was 14.

123
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,350
Mitral valve issues are a frequent complication

124
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,750
of long-term malnutrition.

125
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,840
This bout started about a year ago...

126
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,160
skipping meals, lying about eating,

127
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,860
exercising excessively.

128
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,400
I don't know what else I can do.

129
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,500
I-I can't monitor her 24 hours a day.

130
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,850
I'm not asking you to.

131
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,360
No, but you are starving yourself.

132
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,100
Mom.

133
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,340
Grahamy, come here.

134
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,040
What's he doing here?

135
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,890
When I got home, I heard about the ambulance.

136
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,420
I made Cindy bring me here.

137
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,980
What's wrong with my mom?

138
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,620
She needs a surgery to repair a valve in her heart.

139
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,680
This heart thing, is -- is that why she's so skinny?

140
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,070
Look, what matters, Graham,

141
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,170
is that these doctors are gonna help your mom.

142
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,610
Okay?

143
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,940
You haven't moved your bowels.

144
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,350
Well, thank you, Shaun, for that announcement.

145
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,940
Saves me the trouble of tweeting.

146
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,140
The nurses already knew. They told me.

147
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,440
They also said

148
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,580
you're no longer talking to your dead daughter.

149
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,630
Constipated, but no longer psychotic. A narrow win.

150
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,050
Your first defecation event

151
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,080
is a vital part of the discharge criteria.

152
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,820
Event? What is this, the post-op decathlon --

153
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,580
- pooping, peeing, walking, talking? - Yes.

154
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,390
You have to walk a full lap of the floor.

155
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,400
But you canceled physical therapy this morning.

156
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,680
Those nurses have big mouths.

157
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,810
I canceled because my leg is a little sore.

158
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,770
That could be phlebitis

159
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,110
or a DVT or a --

160
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,270
Could also be an unsurprising complication

161
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,600
from a surgeon poking around in my pons.

162
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,340
Every day in the hospital

163
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,170
increases your risk of infection by 1.37%.

164
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,080
You need to move your bowels, and we should walk right now.

165
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,400
I'll go very slow.

166
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,880
Shaun, is there any chance

167
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,580
that you are needed elsewhere right now?

168
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,230
I-I have 8 minutes

169
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,680
until my patient's cystoscopy.

170
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,510
Good. Be early.

171
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,950
Urethra looks clean.

172
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,470
No lesions, no stones so far.

173
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,430
How do we check for obstructions or stones further up?

174
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,770
Contrast cystogram.

175
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,650
Since you found this patient,

176
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,140
how about you do the honors?

177
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,810
You know this guy used to weigh 370 pounds?

178
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,060
Thread the catheter further into the bladder.

179
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,310
That's a big drop. Good for him.

180
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,520
He did have gastric bypass.

181
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,290
That makes it less impressive?

182
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,420
- Now infuse the contrast. - Well, yeah,

183
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,350
it is the easy way, compared to just diet and exercise.

184
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,130
The contrast dye is dissipating.

185
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,260
It's supposed to.

186
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,730
You said he's training for a race.

187
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,480
Obviously, he turned his life around.

188
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,940
Still dissipating.

189
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,660
Bypass made it physically impossible

190
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,980
for him to eat as much as he wanted.

191
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,710
It's gone. The contrast is gone.

192
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,110
- That makes no sense. - Where did it go?

193
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,840
He probably has a fistula --

194
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,420
a tunnel connecting his bladder to his intestine.

195
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,410
Air and bacteria moving the other direction

196
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,970
caused bubbles in his urine.

197
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,080
Her liver and thyroid are normal,

198
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
but her electrolytes are off.

199
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,160
Her albumin is at 2.1.

200
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,650
She's severely malnourished.

201
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,380
She'll be totally vulnerable to post-op infections.

202
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,930
She needs this surgery to survive,

203
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,320
but she may be too sick to survive the surgery.

204
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,790
In order to operate safely,

205
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,600
we need to boost your caloric intake,

206
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,560
optimize protein.

207
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,140
Can't you do that through my IV?

208
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,290
It's more efficient to pump a nutritional supplement

209
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,680
directly into your stomach.

210
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,630
We use a tube running down from your nose.

211
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,650
I had an NG tube once.

212
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,980
It didn't work.

213
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,560
She couldn't tolerate it.

214
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,570
Because it's not really about food.

215
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,540
It's about control.

216
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,880
You've lived for decades

217
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,100
with a condition that has killed more people

218
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,790
than any other psychiatric illness.

219
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,650
You didn't just survive. You had a child.

220
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,500
Can you tell us how?

221
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,720
When I got pregnant,

222
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,880
it was like this terrifying miracle.

223
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,530
And the thought of gaining all that weight, but...

224
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,450
I wanted him so much.

225
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,670
We both did.

226
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,730
Every meal, I would sit with pictures of his ultrasound,

227
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,060
i-imagining the food going directly to him.

228
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,230
Can you do that again?

229
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,570
Eat for Graham?

230
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,150
We've determined the fistula

231
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,440
between your bladder and intestine

232
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,140
was caused by Crohn's disease,

233
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,290
an inflammatory intestinal condition.

234
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,830
Once we reverse your gastric bypass,

235
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,330
- you'll need -- - Wait. R-Reverse my bypass?

236
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,550
Are you sure?

237
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,160
Bypass surgery shortens the digestive tract.

238
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,930
People with Crohn's disease need every inch of intestine they have,

239
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,240
or they risk critical,

240
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,120
even fatal malnutrition.

241
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,100
Okay, but I don't want my husband to know,

242
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,580
and he'll be here soon.

243
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,460
Well, we would never reveal anything without your permission,

244
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,760
but Crohn's disease is going to require

245
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,650
some major adjustments.

246
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,080
Well, I'll tell Spence about the Crohn's,

247
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,830
and I'll tell him I'm having surgery...

248
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,330
on my bladder.

249
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,670
Your husband doesn't know you had gastric bypass?

250
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,790
That would require him knowing I was obese to begin with.

251
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,890
That's not gonna happen.

252
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,380
Your husband must be very shallow.

253
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,800
Even if I don't disclose

254
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,840
that I reversed your bypass, your scars might.

255
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,660
It requires a separate incision.

256
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,270
Well, tell him there was a complication.

257
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,350
Our obligation to protect your privacy doesn't include lying.

258
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,840
And you shouldn't have to go through this without him.

259
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,330
The single abdominal umbilical port.

261
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,690
We can repair Wade's fistula

262
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,650
and reverse his bypass

263
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,550
all through a single incision.

264
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,760
We can help deceive your husband.

265
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,190
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

266
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,040
That's okay, Spence.

267
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,810
- Got here... as soon as I could. - It's all right.

268
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,550
And since my husband is surrounded by surgeons,

269
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,190
what's the issue, what are you gonna do about it,

270
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,150
and how often have you done it successfully?

271
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,960
How are you doing?

272
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,980
I'm fine.

273
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,310
Graham, would you mind filling this?

274
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,830
You've had one spoonful of tuna,

275
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,670
2 ounces of apple sauce.

276
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,240
That's it?

277
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,770
Mom, if that's all I had,

278
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,240
you'd never let me up from the table.

279
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,870
This is different. I...

280
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,580
can't eat too quickly.

281
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,830
I don't believe you.

282
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,820
It's true.

283
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,120
Your mother is suffering from severe malnutrition,

284
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,180
- and she's trying her best  - I knew it.

285
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,260
You're too skinny. That's why you're here.

286
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,560
That's probably why your heart's messed up,

287
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,880
and you still won't eat.

288
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,000
Graham, I am trying.

289
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,210
- How hard can it be to eat? - I'm not feeling well.

290
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,740
Me and Dad are really worried about you.

291
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,570
Don't you care?

292
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,790
Of course I do, Graham.

293
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,570
- So much. - Then do something.

294
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,300
Prove it.

295
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,590
You provoked that argument?

296
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,100
Yep, and I may have just saved our patient.

297
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,190
She requested an NG tube.

298
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,630
Understanding is nice. Calories are better.

299
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,530
He's screwing this up. His husband's scared,

300
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,100
and he just wants to know what's going on.

301
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,390
Nothing like marital advice from the divorced.

302
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,420
- You're divorced, too. - And I'm not advising.

303
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,350
I'm not judging the health of a marriage

304
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,440
based on a single secret, which is neither shocking

305
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
nor a sign of its imminent demise.

306
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,890
What, truth in a marriage is overrated?

307
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,380
Well, it was in mine. Not every single insight,

308
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,660
opinion, or impulse needs to be shared.

309
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,320
Marriage sounds confusing.

310
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,190
No wonder you both failed at it.

311
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,080
How's it going in here?

312
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,000
Not as bad as I remember.

313
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,020
Does it hurt, Mom?

314
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,050
No, just a little awkward.

315
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,180
Makes it hard to talk.

316
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,400
But I'm okay.

317
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,540
I am so proud of you.

318
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,070
Dr. Glassman hasn't defecated

319
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,820
or done his physical therapy.

320
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,140
I am aware and yet unalarmed.

321
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,120
- Who are you? - I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

322
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,880
Oh, right!

323
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,060
Your Dr. Glassman's... friend.

324
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,060
Please order him to do physical therapy

325
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,030
and give him 15 milligrams of ex-lax.

326
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,850
The ex-lax is a decent idea.

327
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,320
As for the physical therapy, of course, he's stalling.

328
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,480
Glassman's a proud man. He ran this hospital.

329
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,250
He's reluctant to feel weak and vulnerable

330
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,130
in front of people who used to work for him.

331
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,040
That doesn't make sense.

332
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,730
He is weak. He just had brain surgery.

333
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,740
Well, sensical or not, that's my take.

334
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,110
He'll walk eventually.

335
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,780
Every day in the hospital

336
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,570
increases his risk of infection by 1.37 --

337
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,170
Well, you tell him that,

338
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,000
and maybe he'll hop right out of bed.

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,020
I did. It didn't work.

340
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,930
He didn't respond to the stick.

341
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,260
Try the carrot. Although, really, I would just advise --

342
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,090
Dr. Glassman doesn't like carrots.

343
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,380
What should I do with the stick?

344
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,110
It's a metaphor.

345
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,390
Uh, Glassman, appropriately, is the donkey.

346
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,150
The stick signifies punishment.

347
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,690
The carrot signifies...

348
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,010
reward, but he is -- he's recovering nicely,

349
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,270
and your best bet is to just be patient with him.

350
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,290
So, I should use a reward

351
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,260
to motivate Dr. Glassman to do physical therapy.

352
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,520
Actually... what I'm saying

353
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,560
is that you should be patient and supportive...

354
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,570
...and please, please answer that.

355
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,040
Close the door.

356
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,430
We were headed to pre-op when he started projectile vomiting.

357
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,490
It's...green.

358
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,800
That could mean bile and a partial bowel obstruction.

359
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,280
- We need an NG tube. - An obstruction?

360
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,280
Did the Crohn's cause that?

361
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,330
It's hard to know for sure. NG tube -- stat.

362
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,170
You're doing great.

363
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,340
You should try and get some sleep.

364
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,880
I can't.

365
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,090
There's this voice in my head,

366
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,380
and it won't be quiet.

367
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,280
It keeps telling me that

368
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,740
this bag has 60 grams of protein,

369
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,600
40 grams of fat,

370
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,130
1,200 calories in total.

371
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,890
It just won't stop.

372
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,930
Try...to think of Graham and Sam.

373
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,400
I'm trying.

374
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,860
I'll get something to put over that.

375
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,590
Louisa, no!

376
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,330
No!

377
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,440
No!

378
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,450
I'm sorry.

379
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,330
I c-- I just --

380
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,390
I can't stand it.

381
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,490
I got your deposit back.

382
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,310
Why?

383
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,750
Shaun, I told you that you and I can't live together.

384
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,770
No.

385
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,690
You told me

386
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,070
we can't be boyfriend and girlfriend.

387
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,970
We can s-still be friends with benefits.

388
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,910
The benefit is...

389
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,760
we would be living together.

390
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,700
I was clear.

391
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,330
- It's too complicated -- - You were.

392
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,770
We can't date or kiss or have sex.

393
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,510
But I thought you wanted to be friends.

394
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,860
Yes. Of course.

395
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,570
- And spend time together. - Right.

396
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,820
Then it's simple.

397
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,190
She begged us to reinsert the NG tube,

398
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,840
then pulled it out again an hour later.

399
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,600
Do we try again with the tube and restraints?

400
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,280
Oh, we'd just be raising her risk of self-injury,

401
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,850
pneumonia, a blood clot.

402
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,700
What about going back to solid food?

403
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,580
Anything less than 1,200 calories a day,

404
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,000
and her malnutrition wouldn't be improving.

405
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,930
In fact, she'll keep losing weight.

406
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,830
We should go ahead with that valve repair now.

407
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,880
I think we can improve her nutrition

408
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,720
without force-feeding or IVs.

409
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,080
I found a small study where deep brain stimulation

410
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,740
was used to treat anorexia.

411
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,750
You want to use brain surgery for a psychiatric disorder?

412
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,420
Surgical procedures have been effective

413
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,870
for, uh, depression, OCD, addiction.

414
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,360
This surgery could reduce her anxiety around eating.

415
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,400
Once she's eating, her malnutrition will improve

416
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,350
and reduce the risk of the valve repair.

417
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,970
It could also cause personality changes.

418
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,760
And this study covers six subjects

419
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,650
with only 50% success.

420
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,600
Well, this could be Louisa's only shot

421
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,980
at getting free of this illness.

422
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,750
And it was done in the UK.

423
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,800
DBS isn't FDA-approved

424
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,990
for anorexia treatment here.

425
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,060
So, we call an IRB ethics hearing

426
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,530
and argue emergent-use approval.

427
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,070
Which we shouldn't get off such little data.

428
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,550
Nice work digging this up,

429
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,880
but it's not a real option.

430
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,370
Let's go talk to her about the valve surgery.

431
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,110
Can I help you?

432
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,650
I'm looking for a carrot.

433
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,760
17, 18, 19...

434
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,630
No, uh, sorry, we don't have any carrot muffins.

435
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,680
How about a lemon-poppy, Shaun?

436
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,970
Hello, Debbie Wexler.

437
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,320
It's a metaphor for moving a donkey.

438
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,940
I need a carrot because I don't want

439
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,350
to beat Dr. Glassman with a stick.

440
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,960
He likes blueberry muffins.

441
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,170
How's Aaron --

442
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,230
Dr. Glassman recovering?

443
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,520
He moved his bowels this morning.

444
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,510
But he doesn't want to appear weak,

445
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,360
so he hasn't done physical therapy.

446
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,430
I want that blueberry muffin, please.

447
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,320
It has 23 visible blueberries.

448
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,050
You know, Aaron once told me

449
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,330
that his absolute favorites were the chocolate chip ones.

450
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,050
Do you want one of those instead?

451
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,400
Yes, I want one of those instead.

452
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,400
Oh, hi, Dr. Park.

453
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,240
Um, I have a few questions about Wade's surgery.

454
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,380
Sorry, I'm pretty busy.

455
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,960
Actually, I need to get going.

456
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,420
Uh, I'll walk with you.

457
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,070
I know Wade's surgery is this afternoon,

458
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,970
but I've been researching treatments for Crohn's lesions.

459
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,160
What'd we do before the Internet?

460
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,620
I talked to two experts who felt that Wade should be put

461
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,830
on Remicade or Azathioprine

462
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,670
before any surgical interventions.

463
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,800
Interesting recommendations,

464
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,710
but considering they haven't seen your husband's chart...

465
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,220
Well, this doctor felt strongly that you should see

466
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,380
how he responds to medication before --

467
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,720
Wade's care is completely appropriate for his condition.

468
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,440
But if his Crohn's lesions could be treated

469
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,290
- without cutting him open -- - That's not what we're treating.

470
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,790
Excuse me?

471
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,300
Go talk to your husband.

472
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,060
I brought you a chocolate chip muffin.

473
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,350
I love chocolate chip.

474
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,730
Thank you.

475
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,650
Where is it?

476
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,150
At the nurse's station.

477
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,340
- You can walk out to get it. - Shaun, you see,

478
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,340
here I thought you were doing something nice for me.

479
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,760
- I am. - No, you're not.

480
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,800
You're manipulating.

481
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,090
My leg hurts, and I-I have a sore throat,

482
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,870
and I don't feel like walking.

483
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,140
Dr. Blaize says you don't want to seem weak

484
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,560
in front of people - who used to work for you.

485
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,480
Dr. Blaize is wrong.

486
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,010
I don't want to walk because I don't want to walk.

487
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,070
And this is condescending,

488
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,390
and it's insulting, and it's annoying.

489
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,220
Should I get you your muffin?

490
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,850
Well, that would be nice.

491
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,070
An orderly is eating it.

492
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,580
Mr. DeLeon, can I help you?

493
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,510
My wife's decided against the valve-repair surgery,

494
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,390
at least until she's tried the deep brain stimulation for her anorexia.

495
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,950
Did Dr. Browne tell you that it's an experimental brain surgery,

496
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,080
which could alter your wife's personality forever?

497
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,330
That's if we get the special approval required.

498
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,860
She's explained all the issues.

499
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,020
I got our apartment back.

500
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,480
I had to pay $300 more as a deposit

501
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,780
because someone else wanted it, but that's okay.

502
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,510
No, Shaun!

503
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,490
It has a fireplace.

504
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,780
Why aren't you listening to me?!

505
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,100
You're not listening to me!

506
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,700
I'll be okay - running into you naked...

507
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,760
or hearing sex noises

508
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,580
or seeing you cry over breakups with drummers.

509
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,890
I know that you think you can, but how can you be sure?

510
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,670
Because living with you

511
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,920
will be good for me.

512
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,720
It makes me happy.

513
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,430
You remember what you said, Shaun,

514
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,400
that no one can predict the future

515
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,230
and feelings can change?

516
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,820
What if I end up hurting you again?

517
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,030
I don't want to risk our friendship

518
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,620
over an apartment.

519
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,790
Do you?

520
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,460
If we don't live together,

521
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,260
you will have to buy your own batteries.

522
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,990
We'll still see each other. 

523
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,800
That will be hard. I work a lot.

524
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,720
We'll find a way. I know we will.

525
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,610
I need to go to work.

526
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,640
I'll stop on the way home

527
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,200
and tell the manager

528
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,420
we don't want the apartment.

529
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,790
No, I'll do it.

530
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,210
The subjects who responded in this study

531
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:00,130
are all long-term sufferers with a target BMI of 13-16,

532
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,210
who actively pursued this treatment,

533
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,780
much like our patient.

534
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:08,090
Additionally, DBS surgery requires lighter sedation

535
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,710
and places less strain on her system than an open-chest procedure.

536
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,420
You're referring to the valve repair recommended by Dr. Melendez?

537
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,850
Yes.

538
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,020
I propose delaying that surgery by a couple weeks,

539
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,230
which would be well worth it

540
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,650
in terms of reduction of risk

541
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,640
if the DBS is successful.

542
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,240
Excellent presentation, Dr. Browne.

543
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,140
Very thorough.

544
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,790
Agreed, though I do have concerns

545
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,450
about approving this procedure

546
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,440
based on the small subject pool.

547
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,670
But I'll confer with --

548
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,330
There is, uh, one more person

549
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,110
I want you to hear from -- the patient.

550
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,120
This is an IRB, not a therapy session.

551
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,010
Actually, patients who had the opportunity

552
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,640
to air their concerns are eight times less likely

553
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,000
to sue their hospital.

554
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,260
You paged me?

555
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,510
You can step out. Dr. Park's got this.

556
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,260
Grab the sheet.

557
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,480
You talked to Wade's husband.

558
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,330
Maybe we should discuss this later.

559
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,190
I can patch him up while tearing you down.

560
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,920
You violated our patient's confidentiality.

561
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,210
I told him what we weren't treating.

562
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,550
That's not a violation.

563
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,410
And their marriage is better off

564
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,010
for having his secrets out in the open.

565
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,880
That'd be meaningful if you were a marriage counselor

566
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,700
instead of a surgical resident.

567
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,890
Whatever lie blew up your marriage

568
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,960
won't be undone if Wade tells the truth.

569
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,380
I was just trying to help our patient.

570
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,100
Our former patient.

571
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,380
Wade's demanding a transfer to another hospital.

572
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,520
I have tried cognitive behavioral therapy,

573
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,140
food psychodynamic therapy,

574
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,940
family therapy,

575
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,170
in-patient treatment, out-patient treatment,

576
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,300
anti-depressants, NG tubes,

577
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,570
TPN.

578
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,290
And yet, here I am, dying.

579
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,880
Killing myself.

580
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,380
And I can't stop on my own.

581
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,930
Please...

582
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,850
help me...to stop.

583
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,560
Are you aware

584
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,440
DBS has been known to cause personality changes?

585
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,250
In your case, the electrode would be at the nucleus accumbens --

586
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,820
Dr. Browne explained all of the risks.

587
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,490
It's important we know that you understand.

588
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,330
The nucleus accumbens plays a role in maternal attachment,

589
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,040
delivering dopamine when moms interact with their children.

590
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,090
Now, what if in trying to overcome your eating disorder...

591
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,760
you lose the ability to feel love for your son?

592
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,770
My son is everything to me.

593
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,750
For that past year, he has been watching me

594
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,650
starve myself to death.

595
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,910
I'll risk anything

596
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,030
to keep him from seeing me succeed.

597
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,000
Thank you, Ms. DeLeon.

598
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,430
We'll need a few minutes to talk.

599
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,200
You kept it a secret because you think I'm shallow.

600
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,290
- I said the same thing. - I kept it a secret

601
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,750
because of "friendly fatties."

602
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,080
Any news on my transfer?

603
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,670
San Francisco General should have a bed tomorrow.

604
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,170
Come on. It's a joke.

605
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,420
- A joke?! - I'm here to clamp your nasogastric tube.

606
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,300
About a couple we've known for years?

607
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,660
We were at their wedding,

608
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,270
and yet you treat them like a punch line.

609
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,970
- This used to be green. - You're the one who lied.

610
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,890
- Now it's brown. - If I'd known you were offended --

611
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,130
The point is, is that's why I didn't tell you.

612
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,150
Red and green makes brown.

613
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,230
Your bowel is bleeding.

614
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,980
You need surgery now! Page Dr. Park and Dr. Lim!

615
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,610
He has a strangulated bowel.

616
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,150
- Spence. - It's gonna be okay.

617
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,220
We need to open up an O.R. now!

618
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,440
By a margin of 2-to-1,

619
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,620
this Internal Review Board has decided

620
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,610
in favor of allowing this procedure.

621
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,570
- Nicely done. - Thank you.

622
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,490
Hope the surgery goes well.

623
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,580
Use the 45 mm gold stapler.

624
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,130
The truth coming out didn't help Wade's marriage.

625
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,420
Hopefully, with some time.

626
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,070
Secrets are corrosive.

627
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,050
Wade should've been honest from the start.

628
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,110
Maybe Wade thought Spencer would feel

629
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,980
the same way you did about his bypass --

630
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,480
that he lost weight the easy way.

631
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,820
Okay.

632
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,320
It's time.

633
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,300
Graham-y.

634
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,310
You are...

635
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,600
the highlight of my life.

636
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,310
You know that, right?

637
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,400
Yeah. I love you, too.

638
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,090
I love you more than any person on the planet

639
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,030
ever loved any other person on the planet.

640
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,870
I-I know.

641
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,500
Mom, you're gonna be okay, right?

642
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,880
Of course, baby.

643
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,500
Of course.

644
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,760
We'll see you guys in a few hours.

645
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,340
I love you.

646
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,460
The chocolate chip muffin didn't work.

647
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,610
The donkey won't walk.

648
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,490
- I told you that Glassman's probably embarrassed. - No.

649
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,300
He's not.

650
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,920
I asked him,

651
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,870
and he said you were wrong.

652
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,120
Doesn't mean I'm actually wrong.

653
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,090
He needs help recovering.

654
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,110
I'm trying to help,

655
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,680
but it's not working.

656
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,590
He got angry at me.

657
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:27,160
Dr. Glassman is your patient.

658
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,740
You need to fix his lack of mobility.

659
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,910
This is your problem.

660
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,250
I don't know what to do.

661
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,210
I don't know how to help him.

662
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,040
Being sick is hard.

663
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,780
Being around sick people is hard.

664
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,240
We want to help.

665
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,550
We all struggle with what to do.

666
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,330
- Your obsession -- - Okay.

667
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,180
More than a muffin or a bowel movement

668
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,060
or a walk around the ward,

669
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,460
what Glassman needs is someone to be there for him.

670
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,000
A patient, supportive friend.

671
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,430
I know the perfect person.

672
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,190
Hey, there.

673
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,950
How are you feeling?

674
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:24,950
I'm okay.

675
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,250
I feel like...

676
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,580
I want something to eat.

677
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,590
I'm hungry.

678
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:41,920
All right, buddy.

679
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,680
Let's get you home.

680
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,800
Get you a decent night's sleep.

681
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,680
See you in the morning.

682
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,570
I'll get you some food.

683
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,370
Are you sure you're all right?

684
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,040
Yeah.

685
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,210
I just...

686
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,670
I wonder if that hug felt different for him.

687
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,380
Did it for you?

688
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,190
Your husband's surgery went well.

689
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,190
He's in recovery now.

690
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,690
I think he's awake.

691
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:41,530
Thank you.

692
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,000
Wade told me where to find these.

693
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,790
This is him before bypass?

694
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,650
He said that seeing these would help me understand

695
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,010
why he never told me.

696
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,010
Which...

697
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,840
I said was ridiculous.

698
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,440
Is he gonna end up like this again?

699
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,690
It's possible.

700
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,250
I wish I didn't know that.

701
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,180
Yeah?

702
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,560
Debbie, hi.

703
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,150
Shaun thought you could use a visit.

704
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,110
Oh, and, uh --

705
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,740
and another muffin.

706
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,470
Thank you. I wish I'd known you were coming.

707
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,000
I would've slipped into something a little less comfortable.

708
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,000
You look -- good.

709
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,670
Unlikely, but thank you.

710
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,670
I am --

711
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,920
sorry that I've been...

712
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,510
out of touch.

713
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,760
Well, I had a brain tumor.

714
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,680
Understandable. We both dropped the ball.

715
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,560
Okay.

716
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,920
- Here we go. - What's happening?

717
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,000
- We're taking a walk. - Oh, no, no, thank you.

718
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,110
- No, my leg hurts a -- - Oh, yes, we are. Yeah, mm-hmm.

719
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,870
Which is exactly why you need to take a walk.

720
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
You're really good at this.

721
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,930
You sure you haven't done this before?

722
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,580
I spent a little time as a nurse.

723
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,770
I always liked the night shift.

724
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,840
Everything gets really quiet.

725
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,130
It's almost -- it's almost peaceful.

726
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,950
Just came from Louisa's room.

727
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,700
She's eating.

728
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,280
That's great news.

729
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,410
Yeah.

730
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,910
Hopefully we'll be able to do the valve repair

731
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,120
in a couple weeks.

732
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,410
I hope you're right.

733
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,000
But you won't be a part of the surgery.

734
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,090
Or any of my surgeries.

735
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,170
You went around me, directly to the patient.

736
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,280
I had a good idea

737
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,780
that you didn't take seriously.

738
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,760
I considered it,

739
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,410
and then I decided against taking it to the patient.

740
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,030
And yet, I managed to get Aoki and Andrews

741
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,560
to sign off at the IRB.

742
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,900
You didn't get Andrews.

743
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,190
You voted for me?

744
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,950
You made a strong case.

745
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,410
But you're --

746
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,590
you're booting me off your service?

747
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,330
Disagree with me all you want.

748
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,010
I expect my residents to.

749
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,330
I expect them to argue passionately for their position.

750
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,670
And I expect them to then accept my decision.

751
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,840
Even when you're wrong?

752
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,680
I can't run my team any other way.

753
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,130
You know what was insane,

754
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,990
it was the 1928 Torpedo Roadster.

755
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,540
With the Purpleheart trim?

756
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,760
And the lizard-skin interior.

757
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,290
My neighbor in Wyoming had a Silver Arrow.

758
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,040
I'd love to drive one just once.

759
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,130
Good job. You got him walking.

760
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,180
Debbie Wexler did it.

761
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,350
She's a better carrot than I am.

762
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,810
She's a better friend.

763
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,230
Hey, it's me.

764
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,610
Yeah, just making sure the check got there okay.

765
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,700
Great, great.

766
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,160
Hey, I have a question...

767
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,280
about Phil.

768
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,290
I know, I know. He's long gone.

769
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,830
I was actually wondering...

770
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,640
what do you think would've happened

771
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,250
if I hadn't seen you two together?

772
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,520
I found my next apartment.

773
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,110
Okay.

774
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,820
It's has a fireplace...

775
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,460
and natural lighting...

776
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,380
No. N-n-no.

777
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,870
And a really great roommate

778
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,780
who's also a friend.

779
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:27,580
He works a lot, so might be hard to see him otherwise.

780
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,250
I'm talking about you, Shaun.

781
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,920
I don't want to risk anything hurting our friendship.

782
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,260
If you say you can handle living together,

783
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,550
I trust you.

784
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,060
W-we're...going to be roommates?

785
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,170
I-it has a fireplace.

786
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,240
Yes, it does.

787
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,760
We're going to be roommates!

788
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,000
We're gonna be roommates!

789
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,060
- Okay! - Yes.

790
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,380
- Okay! - Yes.

791
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:15,920
We're gonna be roommates!
