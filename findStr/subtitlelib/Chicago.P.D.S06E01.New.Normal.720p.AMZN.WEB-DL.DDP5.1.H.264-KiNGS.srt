I mean, it's not easy.
I get it.

00:34:19,796 --> 00:34:24,105
Bro, we pull it off...

896
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:28,414
Everybody wins.

00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:47,998
Hmm.

899
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:53,091
- Sorry I'm late.

900
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,136
Such a beautiful city.

901
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,485
- That why you texted me?

902
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:58,879
To talk about Chicago
architecture?

903
00:34:58,922 --> 00:34:59,967
- No.

904
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,011
I wanted to thank you

905
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:03,405
for finding the bad dope.

906
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:04,928
- Wasn't me, I'm on suspension.

907
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:07,366
- Dawson told me everything.

908

Said if it wasn't
for your intel

909
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:12,284
there would be 50 more dead
bodies on the street.

910
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:13,502
And I wanted to apologize

911
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,939
for our conversation earlier.

Turns out there is some
footage of the shooting.

914

- You get a chance
to review it?

915
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:24,818
- You bet.

916
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:27,386
It was...

917
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:30,302
more ambiguous than I was
led to believe.

918
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:32,130
- It's not ambiguous.

919
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,915
He reached for his gun
so I shot him.

920
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,265

agree with that...

922
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:43,141
- It was a good shoot.
I don't need any help.

923
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,317
- Don't be stupid.

924
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,103
We all need help.

925
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:55,936
- I guess it depends
on the cost.

926
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:59,157
- I want you to support
Kelton for mayor.

927
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,072
- Support him how?

928
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:04,205

00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:30,318

937
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:36,411
- A letter of exoneration

938
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:38,544
for Alvin Olinsky.

939
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:42,461
So his wife and child
can collect his pension.

940

- That's a big ask.

941

Uh, Hank, I tried calling.

But, um...

- What is it, Trudy?

972
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:56,290
- I just got off the phone
with Meredith.

973
00:38:56,334 --> 00:39:00,729
She would prefer it if you
did not attend the funeral.

974
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:12,350
