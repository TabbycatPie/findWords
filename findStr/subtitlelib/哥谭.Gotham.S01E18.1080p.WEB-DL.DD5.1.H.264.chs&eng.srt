We served together, sir.

请安心在这里待几天吧
Please, feel free to stay with us a few days.

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,000
你在偷我们的东西
You're stealing from us?

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,090
阿诺德・弗拉斯
Arnold Flass.

7
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,510
你因杀害利昂・温克勒被捕了
You're under arrest for the murder of Leon Winkler.

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,510
内务处说他是自杀
I.A. ruled it a suicide.

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,020
阿诺德・弗拉斯  你被捕了
Arnold Flass, you're under arrest.

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,340
我有人罩着
I'm protected.

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,810
那么  惹事的就是你吗
So... you're the one causing all of the fuss.

12
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,940
你休想从我身上拿走任何东西
You will take nothing from me.

13
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,040
是吗
Really?

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,430
不
No!

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,840
他没什么切实证据
He has nothing concrete.

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,590
现在是对那孩子采取行动的最佳时机
Now's the time to make a move on the kid.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,480
食堂选择不多
Slim pickings at the food court.

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,170
-给你买了百吉饼  -谢谢
- Brought you a bagel. - Thanks.

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,730
没给伤患买吗
Nothing for the invalid?

20
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,990
抱歉  只能吃医院的食物
Sorry. Hospital food only.

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,050
-医生嘱咐  感觉怎样  -还好
- Doctor's orders. How you feeling? - All right.

22
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,450
被刺伤了点
Had a slight... puncture.

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,550
有点漏
Leaked a bit.

24
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,650
昨晚的事你估计都记不清了
So I know last night must be kind of a blur,

25
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,330
但你知道是谁干的吗
but do you have any idea who did this?

26
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:07,900
是...
It-it was...

27
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,450
当时很黑  非常黑
It was dark. It was very dark.

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,390
看到了
Saw a...

29
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,560
一道黑影  然后...
shadow and...

30
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,950
我的恩人布鲁斯少爷就站在我身边了
my savior Master Bruce was leaning over me.

31
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,800
你看到那人的长相了吗
Did you get a look at the guy?

32
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,410
没有
No.

33
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,040
抱歉  警监不停打电话
Sorry. My captain keeps calling.

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,680
没事的  警探
It's fine, Detective.

35
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,990
-去吧  -没事  我可以留下
- Just-just go. - No, I can stay.

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,430
我真的很感谢你陪着布鲁斯少爷
I really appreciate you sitting with Master Bruce,

37
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,880
但如你所见  我都没事了
but as you can see, I'm completely fine.

38
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,590
走吧
Go.

39
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,110
好  我尽量待会儿来看你们
All right. I'll try and stop by later.

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,240
再次谢谢你能来  警探
Thank you again for coming, Detective.

41
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,340
为什么不告诉他实情
Why not tell him the truth?

42
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,550
信不信由你  布鲁斯少爷  雷吉是我朋友
Well, believe it or not, Master Bruce, Reggie's a mate,

43
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,830
你不能让警察去抓朋友啊
and you don't set coppers on your mates, do you?

44
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,930
但他差点杀了你
But he nearly killed you.

45
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,600
我跟那混球一起当过兵
I served with that bastard.

46
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,930
要有人去找他  也得是我
Anyone sorts him out, it's me-- nobody else.

47
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,070
否则不义气
It wouldn't be right.

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,430
他为什么要捅你
Why would he stab you?

49
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,010
这是个好问题
That's a bloody good question.

50
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,170
还是个
And one...

51
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,370
我想弄明白的问题
I mean to find out.

52
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,400
那疯子一天不抓回来
'Cause longer that bloody lunatic's out on the loose...

53
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,480
想找到他就越难
...the harder it's gonna be to find him.

54
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,550
你去...
Now, you just...

55
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,340
回床上去  阿尔弗雷德
G-get back in bed, Alfred.

56
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,730
把袍子给我
Just pass me my robe.

57
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,280
回床上去
Get back in bed!

58
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,000
这是命令
That's an order.

59
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,810
你醒了
You're awake.

60
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,550
好极了
Wonderful.

61
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,720
我这是...
How long have I been...

62
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
睡了多久吗
Asleep?

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,440
就从昨晚到现在
Just since last night.

64
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,080
感觉如何
How do you feel?

65
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,490
头疼欲裂
My head hurts.

66
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,610
预料之中
To be expected.

67
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,810
让我看看
May I?

68
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,440
你是谁
Who are you?

69
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,220
弗兰西斯・杜马赫医生
Dr. Francis Dulmacher.

70
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,420
这里的创建者
Founder of this facility.

71
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,240
很荣幸
A pleasure.

72
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,170
我为见你可是费尽心思啊  医生
I've gone to great lengths to meet you, Doctor.

73
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,040
的确如此
Indeed you have.

74
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,590
我得说  你们的体质令人赞叹
I must say you have a remarkable constitution.

75
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,330
真希望我所有病人都这样
I wish I could say the same of all my patients.

76
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,560
我现在是病人了吗
So I'm a patient now?

77
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,830
不再是囚犯了吗
No longer a prisoner?

78
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,080
我说实话  我不知道你该算什么
I confess I don't know what you are.

79
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,010
你控制了地下室
You seize control of the basement,

80
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,730
绑架了我的一名守卫
take one of my guards hostage,

81
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,160
然后把自己的眼睛挖出来了
then scoop out your own eye.

82
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,170
我该拿你怎么办
What am I to do with you?

83
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,590
很简单  让我当你的左右手
Simple. Make me your right hand.

84
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,430
很高兴你还会开玩笑
I'm glad to see you've retained your sense of humor.

85
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,500
我没开玩笑
I'm not joking.

86
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,220
过去十年里
For the past ten years,

87
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,440
我一直都是卡麦・法尔科内的得力手下
I've been Carmine Falcone's top lieutenant.

88
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,460
不好意思  没听过那个名字
I'm afraid the name means nothing to me.

89
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,640
我被关进了地下牢房  又饿又孤独
I woke up hungry and alone in an underground cell.

90
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,890
不到一周  我就把这里闹得天翻地覆
In less than a week, I brought this place to a standstill.

91
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,060
你试过了与我为敌
Now, you've had me as your enemy.

92
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,350
你难道不希望我跟你站一边吗
Wouldn't you rather have me as your friend?

93
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,530
真有活力
Such vim.

94
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,540
真有派头
Such... panache.

95
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,430
好极了
Bravo.

96
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,170
现在你该吃饭了
And now you should eat.

97
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,230
我让护士送点食物进来
I'll have a nurse come in with some food.

98
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,590
咱们等会儿再聊
We'll talk more later.

99
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,170
眼睛这东西挺难搞的
Tricky things, eyes.

100
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,880
目前我们的存货少得可怜
Our stock is frightfully low at the moment.

101
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,840
很抱歉了
Oh, and apologies.

102
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,060
我们没找到与你原来颜色相同的
We couldn't match your original color.

103
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,270
咱们等下再聊
We'll talk soon.

哥谭
第一季  第十八集

110
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,300
{\an8}缉毒组警探无罪释放  谋杀罪名撤销

111
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,070
这不可能
This can't be true.

112
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,070
我正在给地检官准备案子
I was prepping the case for the D.A.

113
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,820
结果今天早上就听到了消息
when word came down this morning.

114
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,830
显然媒体昨晚就知道了
Press got it last night, of course.

115
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,690
我们手上有谋杀凶器
We had the murder weapon.

116
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,420
上边有弗拉斯的指纹
With Flass's prints.

117
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,260
这不可能
There's no way.

118
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,080
显然  辩方找来了一位证人
Apparently, the defense dug up a witness,

119
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,750
洗清了弗拉斯的罪名
cleared Flass of all charges.

120
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,590
-什么证人  -不知道
- What witness? - No idea.

121
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,870
只有法官和首席律师知道
Only the judge and the lead attorneys were privy,

122
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,610
而我们可敬的地检官不肯说
and our honorable D.A. is staying mum.

123
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,450
那传唤呢
What about a subpoena?

124
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,980
我们没有足够的理由
We don't have sufficient grounds.

125
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,390
但是我四处打听了一下
But I did a little snooping around.

126
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,430
怎么样
And?

127
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,120
那位神秘证人是洛布局长提供的
The mystery witness was provided by Commissioner Loeb.

128
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

129
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,530
洛布恢复了弗拉斯缉毒组组长的身份
Loeb's reinstating Flass as head of Narco.

130
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,410
更糟
Worse.

131
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,410
他宣布支持弗拉斯参加
He announced he's backing Flass for president

132
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,800
即将到来的警察工会主席的竞选
of the policemen's union in the upcoming election.

133
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,080
所以你是说一个我们已知是毒贩子
So you're telling me a man we know is a drug dealer

134
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,160
和杀人凶手的人
and a murderer

135
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,020
将有可能在哥谭市警局出任要职
is gonna potentially hold a major position in the GCPD?

136
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,980
洛布显然是在示威
Clearly, Loeb's sending a message.

137
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,630
这不可容忍
This is not gonna stand.

138
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,600
我和你一样失望  吉姆
Look, I'm just as upset about this as you are, Jim,

139
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,060
但他是局长
but it's the commissioner.

140
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,700
所以情况更糟了
Which is what makes it worse.

141
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,420
吉姆  吉姆
Jim! Jim!

142
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,320
吉姆
Jimbo.

143
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,540
你听到好消息了吗
You heard the good news?

144
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,100
伙计们正准备在奥唐丽餐厅给我开场回归宴
Hey, the boys are throwing me a welcome back down at O'Donnelys.

145
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,190
不知道你想不想来看看
Figure you want to stop by.

146
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,130
支持一下你的准新主席
Show support for your soon-to-be new president.

147
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,080
我看你还是别急着庆祝
I wouldn't celebrate just yet.

148
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,550
你就是学不乖
You just don't learn.

149
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,000
还想搞掉我呢
Still want to take me down.

150
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,740
我就像是凤凰
I'm like the phoenix.

151
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,700
我会浴火重生
I'll just rise

152
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,970
一次  一次  又一次
again and again and again.

153
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,040
戈登警探
Ah, Detective Gordon.

154
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,380
我就预感你会来找我
I had a presentiment I might be seeing you.

155
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,550
阿诺德・弗拉斯是个杀人犯
Arnold Flass is a murderer.

156
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,010
他应该待在监狱里
He belongs in jail.

157
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,120
弗拉斯警探依法无罪释放
Detective Flass was legally exonerated.

158
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,850
法官听取了证词  案件结束了
The judge heard testimony. The case is closed.

159
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,250
你是动用关系安排他获释
You used your connections to orchestrate his release.

160
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,970
你玷污了体制
You perverted the system.

161
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,520
暴躁和天真是个坏组合
Petulance and naiveté are a bad combination.

162
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,080
输了就要认命
Know when you're beaten.

163
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,210
弗拉斯的调查我介入很深
I was knee-deep in the Flass investigation.

164
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,330
没有人能有足够的可信度
There is no one with enough credibility

165
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,810
来推翻我们的证据
to trump our evidence.

166
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,360
我很喜欢不可动摇的信念
I do enjoy when unwavering certainty

167
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,880
被真相击碎的时刻
is undermined by the truth.

168
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,050
看着镜头  说出你的名字
Look into the camera, state your name

169
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,110
还有为什么会在这里
and why you're here.

170
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,150
我是哈维・布洛克警探
My name is Detective Harvey Bullock,

171
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,340
我使用了假证据指证了
and I presented false evidence against

172
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,930
我哥谭市警局同事  阿诺德・弗拉斯警探
my fellow GCPD detective, Arnold Flass.

173
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,440
你在这儿啊
Hey, there you are.

174
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,100
老兄  我感觉就像是昨晚有一群牛
Aw, dude. Feel like a herd of cattle had a dance party

175
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,030
在脑子里开了一场舞会
in my head last night.

176
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,870
有什么事吗
What's up?

177
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,420
你为什么要撒谎保弗拉斯
Why the hell would you lie to exonerate Flass?

178
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,420
别否认  我都看到录像带了
Don't deny it. I saw the tape.

179
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,090
我也没打算否认
I'm not denying anything.

180
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,520
我那是迫不得已
I did what I had to do.

181
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,280
如果我不按洛布说的做  早就被开除了
If I didn't do what Loeb told me to do, I would've lost my job.

182
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,710
说不定都进监狱了
Probably gone to prison.

183
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,680
他有你什么把柄
What does he have on you?

184
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,400
哈维
Harvey.

185
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,810
你真以为你是唯一一个
Do you honestly think you're the only one

186
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,590
被人命令带一个混混去码头
who had the orders to take a punk down to the end of a pier

187
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,920
一枪崩了他的人吗
and put a bullet in his head? Huh?

188
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,320
区别在于我那个科波特没回来
The difference is my Cobblepot didn't come back.

189
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,140
你杀的是谁
Who'd you kill?

190
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,640
就一个黑帮小混混
Some scumbag mobster.

191
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,330
有天看到他从夜店出来
Caught him coming out of a club one night.

192
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,080
带我的警司给了我把枪然后拿枪指着我
My sergeant put a gun in my hand, held another to my head,

193
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,620
说  你自己选
and said, "Make a choice."

194
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,210
我选择了活
I decided to keep breathing.

195
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,610
该死  哈维
Damn it, Harvey.

196
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,730
怎么了
So what?

197
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,210
你要怎么办  抓我吗  那你抓吧
What are you gonna do? Arrest me? Go ahead. Arrest me.

198
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,370
别收手啊
But don't stop there.

199
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,870
哥谭市警局半数警察都有个科波特
Half the cops in the GCPD have a Cobblepot,

200
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,320
洛布有他们所有人的把柄
and Loeb has the goods on all of them.

201
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,310
这就是洛布的专长
That is what Loeb does.

202
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,970
那到此为止了
Well, it ends now.

203
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,380
吉姆
Jim, hey.

204
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,400
查弗拉斯已经够糟了
Going after Flass was bad enough.

205
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,370
你要查洛布那就是自杀  没其他可能
Going after Loeb is suicide, plain and simple.

206
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,340
怎么
So what?

207
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,110
我就该保持沉默
Am I supposed to stay quiet?

208
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,460
像你们其他人那样乖乖听话
Fall in line like the rest of you?

209
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,620
这是个好主意
That would be a good idea.

210
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,080
我要这么做还不如直接辞职
Day I do that is the day I quit being a cop.

211
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,820
天哪
Oh, my.

212
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,820
有趣的事实
Fun fact.

213
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,030
人类通过信息素来吸引异性
The human species attracts members of the opposite sex via pheromones

214
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,610
而信息素由唾液  汗液和尿液分泌
secreted through saliva, sweat and urine.

215
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,630
好恶心
Gross.

216
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,240
但是
But...

217
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,000
用这种兽性的方式选择合适伴侣
one can't always trust such an animalistic method

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,610
并不总是可靠的
to find a suitable partner.

219
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,490
你到底想说什么
What are you trying to tell me?

220
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,600
阿诺德・弗拉斯被释放了
Arnold Flass was released.

221
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
我知道你们俩本来在交往
I know that you two were dating,

222
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,150
如果你们之间的好感不是出于理智
and if the attraction wasn't intellectual--

223
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,570
否则也不会选那个蛮人了
how could it be with that gorilla?--

224
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,700
那吸引肯定是来自肉欲
then it must be physical.

225
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,080
他是个很坏很坏的...
He's just... he's such a bad, bad, bad...

226
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,150
谢谢你的关心
I appreciate your concern.

227
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,310
但你想多了
But it won't be necessary.

228
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,840
我现在知道世界上还有比
I've realized there are far better men

229
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,740
阿诺德・弗拉斯好的多的人
in the world than Arnold Flass.

230
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,400
你是说洛布这些年一直在搜集警察的把柄
So Loeb's been collecting dirt on cops for years

231
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,310
还用它来控制警局
and using it to control the department.

232
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,990
恐怕不只如此
I doubt it stops there.

233
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,150
可能还涉及商界和政界
He's probably got leverage on businessmen, politicians.

234
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,230
他可没有我的把柄
He's got nothing on me.

235
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,290
只是确认一下
Just checking.

236
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,370
不管怎样  这就是他有影响力的原因
Anyway, yeah, that's the source of all his power.

237
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,050
而你打算虎口夺食
And you want to steal the dragon's gold.

238
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,680
如果能找到他搜集的证据并毁掉
If we find his cache of evidence and destroy it,

239
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,690
那他就是没牙的老虎了
he'll be toothless.

240
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,020
我了解洛布
Oh, I know Loeb.

241
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,640
他肯定藏的很好
He won't keep it anywhere obvious.

242
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,590
我们可以监视他  让他自己暴露
We could watch him, hope he leads us to it.

243
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,920
没那么多时间了
We don't have that kind of time.

244
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,980
洛布就没有什么曾经信任的人吗
Isn't there someone Loeb might have trusted?

245
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,730
闹翻的朋友
Ex-friends?

246
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,540
失和的妻子
An estranged wife?

247
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,060
他倒是结过婚
Well, he was married.

248
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,830
妻子20年前就死了
She died 20 years ago.

249
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,860
从楼梯上摔下来的
Fell down the stairs.

250
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,440
当时还有传言说是洛布杀的
Well, there were rumors Loeb killed her,

251
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,730
但也不了了之了
but nothing ever happened with it.

252
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,080
我还是不敢相信你搭档这么做了
Still can't believe about your partner.

253
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,620
他为什么这么做  洛布有他什么把柄
Why'd he do it? What's Loeb have on him?

254
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,850
我不知道
I don't know.

255
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,020
肯定很难受吧
Well, it's got to be rough.

256
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,470
我理解警察和搭档之间的关系
I know how it is with cops and their partners.

257
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,260
怎么了
What is it?

258
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,460
有什么事啊  丹特
What's the matter, Dent?

259
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,820
兰布斯塔的案子不是完结了吗
I thought that Lambusta case was settled.

260
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,510
而且我们为什么要在这儿见
And why the hell are we meeting here?

261
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,500
等会儿你就知道了
You'll see.

262
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,450
你认识吉姆・戈登吧
You know Jim Gordon?

263
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,510
到底是怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

264
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,460
坐下说吧
Have a seat.

265
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,000
洛布当上局长之前
Back before Loeb was Commissioner,

266
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,460
还是职位卑微的凶案组警察时  你俩曾是搭档
when he was a lowly homicide dick, you were his partner.

267
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,070
那是20年前的事了
Yeah? That was 20 years ago.

268
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,480
可我听说  警察间的搭档关系就像婚姻
But I always hear that cop partnerships are like marriages.

269
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,590
你们对彼此的了解胜于你们的妻子
You know each other better than your wives.

270
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,340
我说的对吗  吉姆
Isn't that right, Jim?

271
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,280
没错
That's right.

272
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,070
你在查洛布杀妻那个老掉牙的说法吗
You digging up that old story about Loeb killing his wife?

273
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,860
她死的时候  他和我在一起
He was with me when she died.

274
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,650
我们已经知道秘密档案的事了
We know about the secret files.

275
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,290
什么秘密档案
What secret files?

276
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,510
演得太棒了
Oh, that was good.

277
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,500
我几乎相信了他
I almost believed him.

278
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,990
-你呢  吉姆  -我不相信
- What about you, Jim? - No.

279
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,290
你们是不自量力  孩子  你们俩都是
You're out of your depth, kid. Both of you.

280
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,080
回头是岸吧
Swim back to shore.

281
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,120
他手上也有你的把柄  是吗
He's got something on you, too, doesn't he?

282
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,990
他逼你做了件事
He got you to do something for him.

283
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,980
是什么
What was it?

284
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,210
抢劫  威逼
Robbery? Coercion?

285
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,130
还是杀人
Murder?

286
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,170
一直以来  你因此而受制于他
And all this time, he's been using it to keep you under his thumb.

287
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,060
现在是你重获自由的机会
This is your chance to breathe easy again.

288
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,020
把握机会  格里格斯
Take it, Griggs.

289
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,010
我不知道你们俩在说什么
I don't know what you two are talking about.

290
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,220
如果我知道  我会叫你们去找陆西吧
If I did, I'd say talk to Xi Lu.

291
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,150
休伦街的华人簿记员
Chinese bookkeeper on Huron Street.

292
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,280
洛布总说  如果想安全存放一样东西
Loeb always said you want to keep something safe,

293
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,440
就把东西交给陆西
you give it to Xi Lu.

294
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,940
要带上布洛克吗
You want to bring in Bullock?

295
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,420
我们可能需要他
We might need him.

296
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,400
不用了
No.

297
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,150
谢谢你  乔
Thanks, Joe.

298
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,210
我说真的
I mean it.

299
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,960
我喜欢蓝色
I like the blue.

300
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,360
很高兴你喜欢
I'm so pleased.

301
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,730
病人开心  医生也开心
Happy patient, happy doctor.

302
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,750
哈里斯夫人
Mrs. Harris.

303
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,280
你好啊  医生
Hello, Doctor.

304
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,420
别忘了  6点在阳台听爵士乐
Don't forget-- jazz at 6:00 on the veranda,

305
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,620
但绷带拆除前别喝酒  好吗
but no martinis until the bandages come off, yes?

306
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,330
真乖
Good girl.

307
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,530
肾移植
Kidney transplant.

308
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,870
顺便免费给她整了容  她正需要呢
We threw in a new face for free, and none too soon.

309
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,190
但你需要稳定的器官供给
But you need a steady supply of organs.

310
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,340
是的
Yes.

311
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,820
因为你  这如今突然成了麻烦
Which is suddenly something of a problem, thanks to you.

312
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,530
但我也能帮你解决这个麻烦
But I'm also a solution.

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,140
地下室的人信任我
The people in the basement trust me.

314
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,060
让我管事
Put me in charge,

315
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,740
我向你保证  我能提供可靠的健康产品
and I promise you a dependable flow of healthy product.

316
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,580
或者我可以直接省去麻烦
Or I could save myself the trouble

317
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,130
把你和楼下的人都杀掉
and kill you and everyone downstairs.

318
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,940
如果你有那个选择  你早就会做了
Now, if that were an option, you would have done it already,

319
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,920
而且更不会把这么美丽的眼睛
and you surely wouldn't have wasted this beautiful eye

320
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,300
浪费在我身上
on little old me.

321
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,840
我想给你看点东西
I'd like to show you something.

322
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,890
人们把自己看做是独立独特的系统
People view themselves as unique, self-contained systems,

323
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:02,180
但我们只不过是一堆零件罢了
but we are merely a collection of parts.

324
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,490
如果我替换了你的眼睛  脸蛋和心脏时
What happens when I replace your eyes,

325
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
会怎么样呢
your face, your heart?

326
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,070
你什么时候会不再是你  而成为新的东西呢
When do you stop being you and become something new?

327
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,290
这令我很着迷
That's what fascinates me.

328
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,370
真有意思
Nice talk.

329
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,030
成交吗
Do we have a deal?

330
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,150
有条件
Conditionally.

331
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,010
我会让你回地下室
I will send you back to the basement,

332
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,470
你得把我的守卫弄回来  并向我证明
you will retrieve my guard, and then prove to me

333
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,380
你有能力向我提供人体
that you can provide me with the bodies.

334
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,920
考验我
A test.

335
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,940
要是我失败了呢
And if I fail?

336
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,640
失败者一样有用
Oh, those who fail me still have their uses.

337
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,530
你还记得前任办公室经理吧
You may remember my former office manager.

338
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,490
有趣吧
Amusing, no?

339
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,750
"然后我看着星星
"And then I looked at the stars,

340
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:28,970
{\an8}查尔斯・狄更斯《远大前程》

341
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,660
想到一个人濒临冻死之际
and considered how awful it would be for a man

342
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,850
向那璀璨的繁星看去
to turn his face up to them as he froze to death,

343
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,970
却看不到援助或怜惜  那是多么糟糕"
and see no help or pity in the glittering multitude..."

344
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,680
"你..."
"You're..."

345
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,150
真愉快轻松啊
That's cheerful.

346
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,600
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

347
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,880
艾薇每周溜进医院几次
Ivy sneaks in a few times a week.

348
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,810
偷病人的东西吃
Steals food from the sickies.

349
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,770
她看到了你
She spotted you.

350
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,140
他还好吧
He okay?

351
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,310
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

352
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,060
谢谢
Thanks.

353
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,760
阿尔弗雷德被人捅了
Alfred was stabbed.

354
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,680
是他的老战友
It was a friend of his from the army.

355
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,680
真不幸
That sucks.

356
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,540
我觉得这都是因为我
I think he was there because of me.

357
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,640
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

358
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,950
我召集韦恩集团董事会开过会
I had a meeting with the board of Wayne Enterprises

359
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,780
跟他们说我在调查他们
to tell them I was investigating them,

360
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,500
于是他们就找了个我们会信任的人监视我们
so they sent someone we'd trust to spy on us.

361
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,790
他想找什么
What was he looking for?

362
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,190
我的几份文件不见了
Some of my files were missing.

363
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,160
我觉得他偷别的只是为了掩饰
I think the other things he stole were just cover.

364
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,350
如果我找到他  就可以查出谁雇的他
If I find him, I could find out who hired him.

365
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,920
他是一切的关键
He's-he's the key to everything.

366
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,170
你要去找他
You're gonna track him down?

367
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,530
不是吧  就凭你
Really? You?

368
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,820
我必须这么做
I-I have to.

369
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,600
这都是我害的
This... this is my fault.

370
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,430
小子  你疯了吧
Kid, you're out of your mind.

371
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,210
你看看他  你也想搞成这样吗
Look at him. Is that how you want to end up?

372
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,540
我不指望你能理解
I don't expect you to understand.

373
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,870
-我帮你  -不用
- I'll help. - No.

374
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,860
我不能再让别人因为我受伤了
I can't risk anybody else getting hurt on account of me.

375
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,430
你知道去哪找我
You know how to find me.

376
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,990
陆西
Xi Lu?

377
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,380
哥谭市警局  我是戈登警探
Detective Gordon, GCPD.

378
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,150
我们有几个问题想问你
We have a few questions we'd like to ask you.

379
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,880
我们能私下谈谈吗
Is there somewhere we can talk in private?

380
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,120
问吧  警探
Ask your questions, Detective.

381
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,710
是关于洛布局长的
It's about Commissioner Loeb.

382
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,370
你和他有业务往来  对吗
We understand you two have a business relationship?

383
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,090
我不认识洛布局长
I do not know Commissioner Loeb.

384
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,570
听着  老头
Listen, old man,

385
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,510
我们可以在十分钟内叫来一群助理地检官和警察
we can have a dozen ADAs and cops here in ten minutes.

386
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,390
你这儿每一块钱就都会被充公
They'll confiscate every dollar in this place,

387
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,910
你也得去坐牢
and you will go to jail.

388
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,760
你叫戈登
Your name is Gordon.

389
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,980
没错
That's right.

390
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,740
你是丹特
And you are Dent.

391
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,390
对
Yes.

392
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,360
等一下
Wait here.

393
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,390
好吧  不妙
Okay. Not good.

394
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,380
哥谭市警局
GCPD!

395
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,110
放下武器
Drop your weapons now!

396
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,370
-戈登  -快跑
- Gordon...  - Yeah. Run!

397
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,100
快上来
Get in!

398
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,630
咱们得回去  你得请求支援
We got to go back there. You've got to call backup.

399
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,630
算了吧  五分钟后那儿就会被清干净
Forget it! The place will be cleaned out in five minutes.

400
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,530
多谢你来找我们
Thanks for stopping by.

401
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,170
我还有良心
I got enough on my conscience.

402
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,590
这是格里格斯的圈套
Griggs set us up.

403
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,770
现在洛布知道咱们在找他藏的证据
Now Loeb knows we're after his evidence cache.

404
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,880
格里格斯叫你们去的
Griggs sent you?

405
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,990
他为了保命不惜出卖任何人
Guy would turn on anyone to save his own skin.

406
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,340
你得狠狠吓他
You just got to scare him enough.

407
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,800
-我们试过了  -让我来
- We tried. - Let me.

408
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,710
相信我  律师  你这次还是别参与了
Counselor, trust me, you're gonna want to sit this one out.

409
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,240
给我个名字
I want a name!

410
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,240
-法尔科内  -什么
- Falcone! - What?!

411
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,150
他是唯一一个知道洛布藏东西地点的人
The only person who knows where Loeb keeps his stash!

412
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,870
是法尔科内
Falcone!

413
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,410
他们俩是一伙儿的
The two of them are in it together!

414
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,220
洛布和法尔科内
Loeb and Falcone!

415
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,490
你俩死定了
You two are dead men!

416
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,800
你们敢和洛布和法尔科内作对  你们完蛋了
You're going against Loeb and Falcone? You're dead!

417
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,690
快滚  趁我还没发火
Go! Before I lose my good cheer.

418
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,470
滚
Go!

419
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,290
他说的对
He has a point.

420
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,330
是啊
Yeah.

421
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,340
接下来怎么办
So what next?

422
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,750
假设洛布和法尔科内是唯一知道
Assume Loeb and Falcone are the only ones

423
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,240
证据藏匿点的人
who know where the stash is.

424
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,990
那我们需要一个亲近他们  并肯告诉我们的人
We need someone close to them, someone who'll talk.

425
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,270
哪有这样的人
That person doesn't exist.

426
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,530
有
Yeah, he does.

427
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,900
真不错
Oh, yes.

428
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,760
先生们
Gentlemen.

429
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,180
很高兴见到你们
So nice to see you.

430
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,100
有什么我能效劳的
What can I do for you?

431
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,070
你知道你的要求有多过分吧
You do realize what you're asking me to do?

432
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,490
如果法尔科内阁下确实
If Don Falcone is working with

433
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,270
与洛布局长勾结  暗中藏匿秘密文件
Commissioner Loeb to keep this trove of secrets hidden

434
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,160
而我帮你找到了
and I help you uncover them,

435
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,480
那我就是背叛了自己的老板
I'd be betraying my patron.

436
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,690
-没错  -如果被他发现
- That's right. - If he found out, he'd...

437
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,840
他会大发雷霆的
well, he'd be very angry.

438
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,830
这还是往轻了说
to say the least.

439
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,390
别唧唧歪歪了
Enough with the hemming and hawing.

440
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,680
你到底帮不帮我们
Are you gonna help us or not?

441
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,000
假如我帮了你们
Let say, for argument's sake, I could help you.

442
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,940
我能得到什么好处
What's in it for me?

443
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,750
那我就欠你一个人情
I'll owe you a favor.

444
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,220
不管我要什么都行吗
No questions asked?

445
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,200
吉姆
Jim.

446
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,130
是
Yes.

447
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,300
知道这是什么吗
Do you know what this is?

448
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,250
马德雷瓷罐
Madre Di Dios.

449
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,500
是由意大利乡间的修道士制作的
A hundred bottles made once a year

450
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,590
一年只做100个
by monks in the Italian countryside.

451
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,370
马罗尼阁下最喜欢了
It's Don Maroni's favorite.

452
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,540
你想说什么
What's your point?

453
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,590
这只是一条将来哪天可能用得上的信息
Oh, it's just a piece of information that might be useful one day.

454
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,380
我喜欢收集信息
I like information.

455
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,890
如果我帮你们找到洛布藏文件的地点
If I help you find where Loeb keeps his files,

456
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,300
给我10分钟单独接触文件的时间
you give me ten minutes alone with them.

457
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,680
让我把想要的拿走
I take what I want.

458
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,780
这不是个好主意
This is not a good idea.

459
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,920
5分钟
Five minutes.

460
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,480
而且关于警察的文件不能看
And you don't touch anything that has to do with cops.

461
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,360
5分钟查看文件  外加吉姆・戈登的人情
Five minutes with the files and a favor from Jim Gordon?

462
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,270
成交
Done!

463
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,440
上路吧
So who's up for a road trip?

464
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,920
我们得再给菲什点时间
We have to give Fish more time.

465
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,050
她会带我们出去的  她答应过的
She'll get us out of here; she promised.

466
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,940
你还没看出来吗  她抛弃我们了
Can't you see she abandoned us?

467
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,530
自己跑路  不管我们死活了
Got herself out and left us here to rot.

468
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,020
要我说  我们杀了这家伙
I say we kill this one,

469
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,610
让他们知道我们不是好惹的
let them know we're serious.

470
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,140
-菲什说了...  -菲什  菲什  菲什
- Fish said... - Fish, Fish, Fish.

471
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,880
菲什现在在哪
Where's Fish now?!

472
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,190
我很失望
I'm disappointed.

473
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,810
我说了  我会回来的
I told you I was coming back.

474
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,280
怎么  你们不相信我吗
What, you didn't believe me?

475
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,410
信任是家庭的根基  我们正是如此
Family is built on trust, and that's what we are.

476
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,080
是一家人
A family.

477
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,710
菲什  我劝过他们了
Fish, I tried, I did.

478
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,420
我知道
I know you did.

479
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,310
那你承诺的一切呢
So where's everything you promised?

480
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,650
我们什么时候能出去
When do we get out?

481
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,390
一件件地来
First thing's first.

482
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,700
我和楼上的人谈过了
I spoke to the man upstairs

483
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,230
说了我们的要求  更好的居住条件和餐饮
about our demands for better conditions, better food.

484
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,050
他要求我们也表示一下诚意
He asked for a show of good faith.

485
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,920
要把守卫还给他
We're gonna return his guard.

486
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,650
放他走
Let him go.

487
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,000
立刻
Now.

488
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,700
接下来
Next...

489
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,610
干什么
What?

490
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,730
他们要干什么
What are they doing?

491
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,670
对不起了  亲爱的
I'm sorry, honey.

492
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,040
你在单子上  医生的订单
You're on the list. Doctor's orders.

493
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,420
菲什  菲什
Fish... Fish!

494
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,680
我告诉过你们了吧
I told you, didn't I?

495
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,100
她在为他们卖命了
She's working for them now!

496
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,800
我提醒过你们不是每个人都能活下来
I warned you not everyone would live.

497
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:42,020
他们的牺牲代表了你们能活下来
Their sacrifice means your survival!

498
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,580
我的承诺依然不变
And my promise remains the same.

499
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,150
你确定吗  企鹅
You sure about this, Penguin?

500
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,800
你说这里就是洛布保存了20年
You're telling me this is where Loeb keeps 20 years

501
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,400
肮脏秘密的地方
of dirty secrets?

502
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,040
感觉不对啊
Doesn't feel right.

503
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,580
也许要的就是这样
Well, maybe that's the point.

504
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,940
别人才不会怀疑
No one would suspect it.

505
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,960
你以为会是什么样的地方  布洛克警探
What would you prefer, Detective Bullock?

506
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,820
门口挂个大招牌写着"超级秘密敲诈仓库"吗
A sign saying "Super secret blackmail hoard"?

507
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,120
记得吗  上次我们三个一起出来兜风的时候
You know, the last time the three of us took a ride,

508
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,420
你在后备箱里
you were in the trunk.

509
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,340
我还是喜欢那回
I liked that better.

510
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,210
我说了
I told you,

511
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,790
我偷听到了法尔科内跟洛布的通话
I overheard Falcone on the phone to Loeb.

512
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,500
他说农场很安全
He said the farm was safe.

513
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,960
好了  我在车里等  你们搞定了
Now, I'll wait here, and when you're done,

514
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,030
就给我闪几下手电筒什么的
flash the lights or something.

515
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,960
你要跟我们一起去
You're coming along.

516
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,290
但要是里面的人看见了我  报告给法尔科内...
But if whoever's inside sees me and reports back to Falcone...

517
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,530
那你就死定了
Then you'll be in some really deep doo.

518
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,410
不然你想怎样
What'd you think, huh?

519
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,200
我们替你把脏活儿都干了
We were gonna go do your dirty work,

520
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,900
然后你就悠悠然地走进来
and then you were just gonna waltz in

521
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,920
把好处全捞走
and pick through the leavings?

522
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,630
放尊重点
Have some respect.

523
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,240
你们迷路了吗
You fellas lost?

524
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,460
晚上好  先生
Good evening, sir.

525
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,490
是洛布局长派我们过来的
We were sent by Commissioner Loeb.

526
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,400
我们能进去谈谈吗
Might we have a word?

527
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,620
外面好冷
Out of the cold?

528
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,480
玛姬正在煮茶
Well, Marge is putting on some tea.

529
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,580
我喜欢你们的房子
I love your house.

530
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,560
-很温馨  -谢谢

531
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,270
你们在这儿住多久了
How long have you two been here?

532
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,550
那可有20年了吧
Oh, well, about, uh, 20 years.

533
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,050
洛布先生买下这里后我们就一直这儿了
Ever since Mr. Loeb bought the place.

534
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,760
真难以置信
Hard to believe.

535
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,080
时光飞逝啊
Time, boy.

536
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,450
你们真该看看玛姬那时候的样子
You should've seen Margie back then.

537
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,280
从美人变成了老太婆
Hot to trot.

538
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,000
那之前你们是做什么的
What were you doing before that?

539
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,360
不值一提  玛姬是阿卡姆疯人院的护士
Oh, nothing much. Uh, Margie was a nurse over at Arkham.

540
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,810
而我在铁路公司工作
And I working on the railroad.

541
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,560
你们为什么事来
Why are you men here?

542
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,690
来视察
Inspection.

543
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,820
洛布局长对安全问题有点担忧
Commissioner Loeb has some concerns about security.

544
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,890
我们没听说这回事
We didn't hear nothing about it.

545
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,930
你们没收到信吗
You didn't get a letter?

546
00:27:58,930 --> 00:27:59,890
没有
No.

547
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,120
那就怪了
That's odd.

548
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,010
你们应该收到了才对
Y-You should have gotten a letter.

549
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,510
你们带证件了吗
You got I.D.?

550
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,760
我觉得没有这个必要
Well, I don't know that that's necessary.

551
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,460
不  没关系
No, no. It's fine.

552
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,480
吉姆・戈登  哥谭市警局
Jim Gordon, GCPD.

553
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,320
这位是布洛克警探
This is Detective Bullock.

554
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,500
我们是局长的私人保镖
We're on the Commissioner's personal detail.

555
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,960
他看起来不像是警察
He don't look like a cop.

556
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,950
我是卧底
I'm undercover.

557
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,430
该死的浣熊
Damn raccoons.

558
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,380
吉姆  不如我们开始视察吧
Jim, what do you say we get on with our inspection?

559
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,140
不介意的话麻烦带路
Perhaps you wouldn't mind showing us around.

560
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,460
当然
Oh, absolutely.

561
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,610
玛姬  把我的钥匙拿来好吗
Marge, would you mind fetching my keys?

00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,570

一定要尝尝玛姬的蛋糕

她用酸奶油做的

味道像暖和的周日清晨一样美好

568
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,350
好大的浣熊啊
That's one hell of a big raccoon.

569
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,270
我们从楼上开始看吧
Maybe we should start upstairs.

570
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,830
等她拿钥匙
Oh, just wait a lick for the keys.

571
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,520
玛姬  挺快啊
Margie-pie, that was quick.

572
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,940
夫人  把枪放下
Ma'am, put down the...

573
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,760
别动
Freeze!

574
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,150

Thanks, Jim.

575

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,930
他总放水
He always lets me win.

618
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,380
我爸爸以前也是
My dad used to do the same thing.

619
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,650
是吗
Really?

620
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,570
父亲就这样  是吧
Fathers are funny like that, aren't they?

621
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,530
是啊  你父亲可真好
Yeah, your dad's a real hoot.

622
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,260
他还在这里放别的东西吗
Does he keep other stuff up here?

623
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,860
重要的文件  档案
Like important papers or files or

624
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,840
或者一屋子的盒子什么的
maybe rooms full of boxes?

625
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:32,880
没有
No.

626
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,970
他干吗要那么做啊
Why would he do that?

627
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,390
这是浪费时间
This is a waste of time.

628
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,580
米利亚姆
Miriam...

629
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,730
你母亲出了什么事
...what happened to your mother?

630
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,730
她
She...

631
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,140
死了
died.

632
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,010
我
I, um...

633
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,130
我现在有新的爱好了
I've started a new hobby.

634
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,690
你们想看看吗
Would you like to see?

635
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,730
好啊
Sure.

636
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,220
太好了
Oh, great.

637
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,090
你干什么
What are you doing?

638
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,460
洛布的妻子20年前死了
Loeb's wife died 20 years ago.

639
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,340
因摔下楼梯摔裂头骨
Skull fracture from a fall down the stairs.

640
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,930
米利亚姆那时应该十几岁
Miriam would've been a teenager.

641
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,710
你觉得是洛布杀了她  这孩子是目击证人
So you think Loeb killed her? She was the witness?

642
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,490
所以他才一直藏着她
That's why he keeps her cooped up here?

643
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,300
你说不止我一个人有个科波特
You said I wasn't the only one with a Cobblepot.

644
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,890
或许这是他的
Maybe this is his.

645
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,990
我开始做首饰了
I started making jewelry.

646
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,460
是什么做的
What's it made of?

647
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,180
骨头
Bones.

648
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,020
椋鸟
Starlings.

649
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,540
它们
They, uh...

650
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,950
它们停在我窗沿上
they land on my windowsill,

651
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,410
你可以捉到它们
and... you can catch them

652
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,180
但是要很安静  一动不动
if you're really silent and still.

653
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:00,230
我能耐得住性子  安静不动
And I can be really silent and still.

654
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,880
像老鼠一样不出声
Silent as a mouse.

655
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,930
然后呢
Then what do you do?

656
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,640
我
I...

657
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,180
我挤碎它们的脑袋
crush the back of their heads.

658
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,470
我用大拇指狠狠按下去
I just press down with my thumb.

659
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,910
能发出...
It makes, like, a...

660
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,910
"嘭"的一声
a popping noise.

661
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,410
"嘭"
Pop.

662
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,590
米利亚姆
Miriam...

663
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,450
能跟我们说说你母亲的死吗
...can you tell us about your mother's death?

664
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,660
我是个好人
I'm a good person.

665
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,530
但有时候好人会犯错
Sometimes good people make mistakes.

666
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,250
父亲就这么说的
That's what Father said.

667
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,170
你对你母亲犯错了吗
Did you make a mistake with your mother?

668
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,600
就像鸟那样
Was it like what happens with the birds?

669
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,120
不是
No.

670
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,080
不是像鸟那样
Not like with the birds.

671
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,580
真傻
Silly.

672
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,840
我对她还得用烛台
I had to use a candlestick on her.

673
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,470
她还是唱个不停
She wouldn't stop singing either.

674
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,660
她知道那晚到我了
She knew that it was my night.

675
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,140
我应该在晚餐上表演的
I was supposed to perform at dinner.

676
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,780
不是她
Not her.

677
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,360
所以你就打了她  让她住口
So you hit her and she stopped.

678
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,130
你父亲掩盖了起来
And your dad covered it up.

679
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,850
他知道那晚到我了
He knew that it was my night.

680
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,660
对不起  吉姆
I'm sorry, Jim.

681
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,900
他们朝我冲了过来  我尽力了...
They-they came at me. I tried...

682
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,100
你找到洛布藏的东西了吗
Did you find what Loeb's hiding?

683
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,490
是在这里吗
Is it here?

684
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,630
是的
Yes.

685
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,480
我们说好的
Well, a deal's a deal.

686
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,780
你得让我进去
You have to let me in there.

687
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,440
这是谁
Who's he?

688
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,980
他看上去像只鸟
He looks just like a bird.

689
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,100
我喜欢鸟
Oh, I love birds.

690
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,620
看来你还是没学会敲门呢
I see you still haven't learned the art of knocking,

691
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,810
戈登警探
Detective Gordon.

692
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,400
米利亚姆病了
Miriam is sick.

693
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,760
她不是有意伤害她母亲的
She didn't mean to hurt her mother.

694
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,660
她就是...
She just...

695
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,980
有些冲动
has these urges.

696
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,530
如果你想曝光她的作为  请便吧
If you want to expose what she did, go ahead.

697
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,630
你以为我控制不了一桩丑闻吗
You think I can't weather the scandal?

698
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,720
你当然能了
I'm sure you could.

699
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,590
但你把她藏了20多年不是为了这个
But that's not why you kept her locked away for 20 years.

700
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,020
说说看啊
Do enlighten me.

701
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,020
我认为你爱她
I think you love her.

702
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,800
我认为你尽了一切可能不让她被关进阿卡姆
I think you've done everything you can to keep her out of Arkham.

703
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,290
你今后还会继续这么做
And you'll keep doing it.

704
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,000
你为了达到目的  要拿我女儿相要挟吗
You're willing to hold my daughter hostage to achieve your ends?

705
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,680
你比我想的冷酷多了
You're much colder than I thought.

706
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,730
看来是的
So it seems.

707
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,330
我今天就辞职
I'll hand in my resignation today.

708
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,720
别把米利亚姆扯进来
Just keep Miriam out of it.

709
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,170
不  你不能辞职
No, you're not resigning.

710
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,770
你下台  我又得应付别人了
You step down, I'll have someone else to deal with.

711
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,450
而且他很可能跟你一样  也是法尔科内的走狗
And chances are he'll be Falcone's lapdog, same as you.

712
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,120
对你呢
With you...

713
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,850
我有筹码
I have leverage.

714
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,640
你想要什么
So what do you want?

715
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,820
弗拉斯受审
Flass is tried.

716
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,690
公平公正
Fairly.

717
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,510
把你手里关于布洛克和哥谭市警局
And I want all the evidence you have on Bullock

718
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:09,570
所有其他警察的不利证据都交给哈维・丹特
and every other cop in the GCPD sent to Harvey Dent.

719
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,980
让他决定起诉谁
He'll decide who to prosecute.

720
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,780
不行
No.

721
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,350
我那么做  就死定了
I do that, I'm a dead man.

722
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,810
我爱米利亚姆  但我也爱这条命
I love Miriam, but I love living, too.

723
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,160
可以把布洛克的案卷给你
You can have Bullock's file.

724
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,080
其他的不行
But not the rest.

725
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,540
好吧
Fine.

726
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,480
不要动米利亚姆
And Miriam stays where she is.

727
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,970
就这些了吗
Is that all?

728
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,960
还有件事
There's one more thing.

729
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,700
跟戈登警探一起站在这里几乎都成习惯了
It's become something of a habit to stand up here with Detective Gordon,

730
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,540
但警察工会主席大选在即
but with the coming election for president of the policemen's union,

731
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,150
我首推戈登警探
there's no man I'd rather support.

732
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,240
谢谢  洛布局长
Thank you, Commissioner Loeb.

733
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,620
哥谭市警局迎来了新的一天
It's a new day in the GCPD.

734
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,270
抱歉错过了你风光的一刻
Sorry I missed your big moment.

735
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,580
我想着下次我再去
I figured I'd catch the next one.

736
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,290
你的案卷
Your file.

737
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,210
这是洛布手里关于你的一切了
It's everything Loeb has on you.

738
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,900
我一直讨厌那张照片
Always hated that picture.

739
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,190
知道吗  你告诉自己
You know, you tell yourself...

740
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,880
"我就做这一件坏事
..."I'll just do this one bad thing,

741
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,980
我日后做很多好事  就补回来了"
but all the good things I'll do later will make up for it."

742
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,540
但那不行
But they don't.

743
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,810
坏事还是坏事
There's still that bad thing.

744
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,740
企鹅会回来叫你还人情的
Penguin's gonna come asking for that favor.

745
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,240
小心点
Be careful.

746
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,950
我知道我们说好了
I know we had a deal.

747
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:25,060
我放你们走  你们能逃脱
I let you go, and you escape the inevitable punishment

748
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,180
因为辜负洛布局长
that will descend on your heads

749
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,490
而必然将遭受的惩罚
when Commissioner Loeb hears of your failure.

750
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,220
可惜  我只弄到
Unfortunately, I was only able

751
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,800
一张去亚利桑那的车票
to acquire one ticket to Arizona.

752
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,860
谁能逃呢
So who's it gonna be?

753
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,940
玛姬和我在一起20年了
Margie and I have been together for 20 years.

754
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,440
我们不会分开的
We're not splitting up.

755
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,610
生活有时候很残酷的
Life can be cruel sometimes.

756
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,800
我们怎么决定谁走
How do we decide who goes?

757
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,750
你们自己决定吧
I leave that in your hands.

758
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,570
等等
Wait a minute!

759
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,760
玛姬  玛姬
Margie! Margie!

760
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,220
天呐  好了
Oh my goodness, here, here we go.

761
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,800
好了
Here we go.

762
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,000
好了
Here we go!

763
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,990
火车什么时候开
What time is the train?

764
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,700
没什么火车
Oh, there's no train.

765
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,120
-我就是需要你帮忙  -什么
- I just needed your help. - What?

766
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,320
我只剩一颗子弹了
I was down to one shell.

767
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,610
我在考虑引入萨尔萨舞之夜
I've been thinking of introducing salsa night.

768
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,790
你觉得我们的客人会喜欢吗
Do you think our guests would like that?

769
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,670
不会
No.

770
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,530
坦诚  很好
Honest. Good.

771
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,630
但我喜欢萨尔萨舞
But... I like salsa.

772
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,290
就周二了
Tuesday it is.

773
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,290
那么  你的任务完成了
So... you've completed your task,

774
