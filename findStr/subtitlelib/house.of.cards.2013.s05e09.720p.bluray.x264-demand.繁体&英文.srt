這就是競選
This is the campaign.

31
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,700
我們在這個營地推銷自己
We're here at this camp selling ourselves.

32
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,480
我喜歡馬克  因為我總是知道他的立場
I like Mark, because I always know where he stands.

你和他們想要的東西一樣
You want what they all want.

38
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,320
更好的地位
A better seat at the table.

39
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,780
這我可以給你
And that is something that I can give you.

40
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,810
再次感謝  巴恩斯先生
Thank you again, Mr. Barnes,

41
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,260
謝謝你讓我看
for letting me take a look.

42
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,120
我不忍扔掉任何東西
I just can't seem to throw anything out.

43
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,970
不管情況看起來多糟糕...
No matter how dire things look...

44
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,750
你都能熬出頭的
you're gonna come out of this alive.

45
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,820
-十月早就過了  -確實
- Well, we are way past October. - We certainly are.

46
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,270
我得說  我沒想到這么快就會再來
I must say, I didn't expect to be back here so soon.

47
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,860
我會確保共和黨人
I'll make sure the Republicans

48
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,760
不會維護我的候選人
don't come to my candidate's defense.

49
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
但您會勝選
But you're going to win.

50
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,480
你畢竟是安德伍德家的人
You're an Underwood, after all.

51
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,300
將軍竟然說要殺死總統
The general talked about killing the president.

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,870
再加上康威在飛機上的爆發
That, along with Conway's outburst on the plane--

53
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,240
這么說好像夸大了實際情況
That sounds worse than it was.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,540
不  實際情況就是這么嚴重
No, that sounds exactly as bad as it was.

55
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,240
讓我覺得驚訝的是
What's surprising to me is...

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,970
選舉團隊竟然應對不過來
the campaign couldn't get their hands around this.

57
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,180
哈里·馬歇爾已經很厲害了
I mean, Harry Marshall is as good as they come, but--

58
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,920
他們先是否認  接著又模棱兩可
First they denied, and then they equivocated--

59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,480
這簡直太荒唐了
I mean, that's just, like, ridiculous.

60
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,350
你站出來
You just come out,

61
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,020
"我道歉  我們說錯話了"
"I apologize. We misspoke."

62
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,230
所有人都知道這套路
Everybody knows the drill here.

63
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,920
共和黨人也沒有沖過去幫他們
And it's not like the Republicans rushed in

64
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,650
力挽狂瀾
to save the day either.

65
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,950
-完全不談正題  -他們默不作聲
- Off message throughout. - They got quiet.

66
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,240
這一點我怎么也想不通
Which I will never understand.

67
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,850
威爾·康威可是黨內冉冉升起的新星
Will Conway was a rising star in the party.

68
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,110
怎么能跟安德伍德政治機器相匹敵呢
Look, it's hard to compete with the Underwood machine.

69
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,400
天啊  我們別再說這些"陰謀占領"的瘋話了
God. Let's not do the whole "black helicopters" crazy stuff.

70
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:23,980
太荒唐了
It's ridiculous.

71
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,660
我們得接受安德伍德贏得大選這一事實
Look, we need to accept Underwood won the election.

72
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,570
公眾得接受這個結果  繼續前進
People need to accept the outcome and move on.

73
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,040
我同意范的觀點
I'm gonna agree with Van.

74
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,710
我覺得我們應該感激憲法
I think we need to take a moment to appreciate the Constitution.

75
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,600
它會彎折[妥協]It bent,

76
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,780
-但不會折斷[毀壞]  -說得沒錯
- but it never broke. - That's right.

77
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,470
我們都知道  到最后
And in the end, as we all know,

78
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,500
還是由選舉人團決定
it came down to the Electoral College.

79
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,990
你不用說那句話  州長
You don't have to say the words, Governor.

80
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,090
我應該說
I think I do.

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,540
恭喜  當選總統先生
Congratulations, Mr. President Elect.

82
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,940
這次沒有稿子嗎
There's no script for this one?

83
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,620
國家第一  先生
Country first, sir.

84
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,790
我很高興你這么說  威爾
I'm glad to hear you say that, Will.

85
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,820
我想幫這個國家愈合
I want to start to help the country heal again.

86
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,840
說完了嗎
Are we done?

87
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,410
說完了  但是威爾
We are done. But Will...

88
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,440
我很想向國家展示
I would very much like to show the country

89
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,950
我們兩黨可以齊心協作
that our two parties can work together.

90
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,580
我希望你考慮
So I was hoping that you might consider

91
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,380
做我的運輸部長
becoming my transportation secretary.

92
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,710
如果你同意加入我的內閣
I think it would send a powerful message

93
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,310
會發出一個強有力的信號
if you agreed to join my cabinet.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,130
你覺得我能
You think I'd...

95
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,330
當好運輸部長嗎
make a good... transportation secretary?

96
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,560
沒錯
Yes.

97
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,420
這是開給無名議員的條件
That's what you give the congressman from nowhere.

98
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,300
我會拒絕的
I'll be declining.

99
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,080
聽到你這么說真是太遺憾了  威爾
Well, I'm so sorry to hear that, Will.

100
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,380
我想祝你一切順利
And I wanted to wish you the very best.

101
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,000
去你的  去你的祝福
You and your wishes can go fuck yourselves!

102
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,000
我現在做什么
What do I do now?

103
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,620
所有人都以為威爾會贏
...everyone thought it would happen.

104
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,570
沒人想到安德伍德還能贏
No one thought that Underwood would win again...

105
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,640
我不知道
I don't know.

106
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,710
承認失敗從來都不容易
Acknowledging defeat is never easy.

107
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,250
在公眾面前承認更是無比煎熬
Doing it in public is a living hell.

108
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,900
起碼媒體喜歡他
Well, at least the cameras like him.

109
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,630
我看著滿意嗎
Do I look satisfied?

110
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,210
你看著還算滿意
You look somewhat satisfied.

111
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,870
-好  -"好"可不夠
- Good. - Not good.

112
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,970
弗蘭西斯  享受這一刻吧
Francis, enjoy this moment.

113
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,050
-這是你應得的  -是"我們"吧
- You deserve it. - You mean "we."

114
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,350
我們成功到達另一邊了
We made it to the other side.

115
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,110
是啊
Yes.

116
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,020
但另一邊有什么
But what is on the other side?

117
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,640
勝利
Victory.

118
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,660
稍帶點失敗的氣息
With a whiff of defeat.

119
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,820
花了好久才走到這一步
It's taken a long time to get here,

120
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,880
但我們到了
but we're here.

121
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,620
干杯  弗蘭西斯
Cheers, Francis.

122
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,750
今后一切都會變得容易
Everything gets easier from now on.

123
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,430
他們準備好了
They're ready for you.

124
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,780
-漢娜  -我不想去
- Hannah. - I don't want to go.

125
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,790
不
No.

126
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,940
好吧
Fine.

127
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,760
那我自己去吧
I'll do it on my own.

128
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,150
要知道  這是個重要時刻
I'm gonna say, this is a crucial moment.

129
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,080
對你們兩個都是
For both of you.

130
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,250
看你們如何應對
How you handle tonight.

131
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,790
黨拋棄了我
The party abandoned me.

132
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,010
你的黨
Your party.

133
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,480
我不是共和黨  威爾
I'm not the Republican Party, Will.

134
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,450
我只為候選人效力
I work for candidates.

135
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,190
我為你效力
I worked for you.

136
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,330
聽好  你輸了
Listen, you lost.

137
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,510
但還有一多半國民
But more than half the country

138
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,710
仍認為你是他們的總統
still considers you their president.

139
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,090
你必須要面對他們
This is what's required.

140
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,790
走出去  發表講話
Go down there, give your speech.

141
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,040
認輸吧
Concede.

142
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,260
我正式接受各位的辭呈
As I accept all of your letters of resignation

143
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,780
并解散我的舊內閣
and dissolve my old cabinet,

144
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,840
然后我想歡迎在座各位加入我的新內閣
I wanna welcome each and every one of you to my new cabinet.

145
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,680
-恭喜你  總統先生  -謝謝  凱茜
- Congratulations, Mr. President. - Thank you, Cathy.

146
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,700
我尤其想感謝我的妻子
And I especially wanna thank my wife.

147
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,900
副總統女士
Madam Vice President...

148
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,180
感謝你對我長期堅定的支持
thank you for your unending and unwavering support.

149
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,140
這一個月來  你的堅強領導維持了國家的運作
Your steady hand kept this country running this past month.

150
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,240
我欠她太多  多到我無法想象
I owe her more than I can possibly fathom.

151
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,000
而她也欠我
And she owes me.

152
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,020
不對  你一直在我身邊支持著我
Not true. You were with me all the way.

153
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,810
作為合法當選總統
I would like to make my first 100 days

154
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,920
我希望我的頭一百天能取得盡可能多的成績
as the duly elected president as productive as possible.

155
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,790
當然  挑戰還是很多的
Of course, there are many challenges.

156
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,150
提振經濟
Shoring up the economy,

157
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,910
保護我國不受哈里發國攻擊
securing our nation from ICO

158
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,420
還要降低失業率
and reducing unemployment.

159
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,440
但我們面對的最艱巨的問題
But the biggest challenge that we face,

160
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,800
也是我最需要各位通力協助的挑戰
and the one that I'm going to need all of your help on,

161
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,990
就是重新團結全國
is reuniting a country

162
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,280
彌合這個國家前所未有的裂痕
that has never been more divided than it is today.

163
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,530
我相信我們可以迎難而上
I believe we can meet this challenge,

164
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,960
而我需要各位的幫助
and that's where I'm gonna need all of your help.

168
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,630
現在回去工作吧
Now let's get back to work.

169
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,000
我需要一分鐘
I need a minute.

170
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,500
我想我們應該早做打算
I think we should see what we can do

171
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,260
把厄舍趕走
about making Usher persona non grata.

172
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,620
現在開戰不合適吧
I don't think that's wise to start a war.

173
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,200
我們才剛剛拿下白宮
We've just won the White House.

174
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,280
現在才是出手的最佳時機
This is exactly when we should strike.

175
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,810
只有現在我們才有足夠的政治資本
This is a moment that we have the political capital...

176
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,690
厄舍必須小心處理
Usher needs to be managed carefully.

177
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,310
總統先生
Mr. President?

178
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,020
喘口氣吧  道格
Take a breath, Doug.

179
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,030
我們才剛剛站穩腳跟
We've only just landed on our feet here.

180
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,840
先生  副總統女士
Sir, Madam Vice President,

181
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,600
過去在眾議院  這種人就是重點打擊對象
this is the type of person that we used to crucify in the House.

182
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,420
但現在我們不在眾議院  我們在白宮
Yes, but we're not in the House now. We're here.

183
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,110
我們還有一整個任期呢
We have a full term ahead of us.

184
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,600
我們肯定會取得
There's gonna be a great deal

185
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,000
非常多的成就
that we're gonna be able to accomplish,

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,220
咱們三個合作
the three of us.

187
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,480
感謝您的器重  先生
I appreciate that, sir.

188
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,590
但是馬克·厄舍早晚會變成麻煩的
But Mark Usher will become a problem.

189
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,050
每個人早晚都會變成麻煩
Well, everyone becomes a problem, eventually.

190
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,300
莉安出局了
LeAnn's out.

191
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,450
什么
What?

192
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,290
為什么
Why?

193
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,920
她搞砸了
She screwed up.

194
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,850
有什么需要我準備的嗎
Well, is it something I need to get ready for?

195
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,230
安德伍德夫婦希望間接處理她
The Underwoods want this handled indirectly.

196
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,060
所以我們具體該說什么
So what exactly are we saying?

197
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,760
她被趕走了
She's being pushed out.

198
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,100
好  但是選舉結束了
Okay, but the campaign's over.

199
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,830
還有必要對外說什么嗎
Is it necessary to say anything?

200
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,730
我們需要撇清本屆政府與她
We need to distance this administration

201
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,020
和她工作的關系
from her and her work.

202
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,610
還有她的策略
Her tactics.

203
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,710
得裝成是泄露出去的
So it needs to be a leak.

204
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,940
泄露給不喜歡我們的人
Reach out to the people who don't like us.

205
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,510
他們肯定樂意爆料
They'll be prime to go with it.

206
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,460
等我們回應的時候
Okay, so when we respond...

207
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,240
-是公開還是  -公開
- On the record or... - On.

208
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,570
她做了什么
What did she do?

209
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,540
她展現出了很差的判斷力
She showed some very poor judgment.

210
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,620
我相信你會謹慎的
I'm trusting you to be discreet.

211
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,530
我們贏了  賽斯
We won, Seth.

212
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,380
需要做出一些改變
Changes need to be made.

213
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,440
你知道我已經遠離政治了

214
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,990
你來找我  我真的很驚訝

你是一位非常受人尊敬的記者

216
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,020
就是來參加就職典禮和舞會而已
Just here for the inauguration and the parties.

217
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,290
我想你已經聽說了  我被趕走了
So I imagine you've heard that I'm on the outs.

218
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,950
他們沒有說出全部實情
They're not telling the whole story.

219
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,660
發生了什么
So what happened?

220
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,310
我有個熟人
An acquaintance of mine

221
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,670
從國安局偷了機密文件
stole classified documents from the NSA

222
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,300
去了俄羅斯
and took off to Russia.

223
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,060
他們因為這件事責怪我
They're blaming me for it.

224
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,050
你這個熟人帶走的是什么
What did this acquaintance take?

225
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,600
問題就是這個  我也不知道
That's just the thing. I have no idea.

226
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,340
要是你能找到他  跟他談談
If you could find him, talk to him,

227
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,260
他會告訴你  我和這事一點關系都沒有
he would tell you that I had nothing to do with this.

228
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,620
他是誰  他叫什么
Who is he? What's his name?

229
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,060
艾丹·麥卡倫
Aidan Macallan.

230
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,140
他會跟你談的  他尊重你

231
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,090
告訴他我現在沒事
Tell him that I'm okay.

232
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,050
以后也會沒事的

233
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,520
我堅信派遣地面部隊
I'm a firm believer in boots on the ground.

234
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,910
我們就是為了石油去的  別裝了
Well, we're there for the oil. Let's not pretend.

235
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,370
我不否認保護原油供應的重要性
I'm not denying how crucial it is to protect the oil supply.

236
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,080
但由我們來盯住
But it's in the world's best interest

237
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,010
對整個世界都好

238
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,640
-盯住世界還是石油  -都是
- On the world or the oil? - Both.

239
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,680
難怪你對南極那么感興趣
Well, that explains your strong interest in Antarctica.

240
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,220
我確實關注事情和人
I do focus on things and people.

241
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,560
我常會起憐惜之情
I tend to get attached,

242
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,130
但我覺得這讓我的工作更加出色
but I think it makes me better at what I do.

243
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,670
你現在關注什么
And what are you focused on now?

244
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,500
首先是佩特羅夫和艾哈邁德·艾哈邁迪

245
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,640
抱歉

要是他的書能說明什么的話

255
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,940
你覺得總統會贊同我們的議程嗎
Do you think the president will be sympathetic to our agenda?

256
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,280
"我們的議程"  這么說太自負了
"Our agenda"? That's very presumptuous.

257
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,160
這世界上有些地區

00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,070
只要我去舞會  就會發生可怕的事

263
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,330
順說  我丈夫不會受任何人的擺布

-我不是這個意思  -不是嗎

271
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,260
我應該是沒時間了
I just don't think I'm gonna have the time for it.

272
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,070
過來坐一會兒
But come sit for a minute.

273
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,930
要是你太忙的話
If you're too busy,

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,050
-我能理解  -不  來跟我坐會兒

"要聆聽所有聲音
"A time to hear all the voices.

282
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,290
因為世間最大的孤獨
For there is nothing more lonely...

283
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,180
恐怖
or terrifying...

284
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,260
便是無人聆聽"

285
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,140

我聽到了你們所有人的聲音"
I hear all of you."

292
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,200
你覺得我的曾曾曾祖父
Now, what do you think my great-great-great-grandfather

293
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,140

00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,090
我收到了一條消息  得走了
I got a tip I have to move on.

300
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,410
什么消息
What's the tip?

301
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,080
咱們以前對工作談話可是有規矩的
We used to have a rule about shoptalk.

302
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
是嗎
Did we?

303
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,670
好吧
Fair enough.

304
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,530
你怎么看莉安·哈維
What's your read on LeAnn Harvey?

305
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,720
她很難看透  這也是我喜歡她之處
That she's hard to read. That's what I like about her.

306
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,990
你信任她
You trust her?

307
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,530
凱特  拜托
Kate, come on.

308
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,100
你很憔悴
You look tired.

309
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,960
我現在一周工作八天
I'm working eight days a week.

310
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,100
你以前也總是很憔悴的樣子
I mean, you always looked tired,

311
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,580
但你現在的憔悴  不那么性感了
but now you look tired in a... not sexy way.

312
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,780
抱歉讓你失望了
Sorry to disappoint.

313
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,680
其實我馬上就得回去了
I actually have to get back there in a minute.

314
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,350
這會兒回辦公室有點晚了吧
It's little late to head back to the office, right?

315
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,330
我從上周二起就一直在那邊
I've been there since last Tuesday.

316
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,030
說實話
Honestly...

317
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,540
我知道這話聽起來有點怪
I know this sounds weird...

318
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,940
但我沒有更想去的地方了
There's no place I'd rather be.

319
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:11,290
你這話的語氣真...生硬
The way you say that sounds so... rote.

320
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,880
我說不好
I don't know...

321
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,620
這讓我怎么回應
What am I supposed to say to that?

322
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,060
我只想知道你好不好  僅此而已
I just want to know how you're doing, that's all.

323
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,480
我只是關心你  坐在我眼前的這個人
I'm just asking about you, this person I'm sitting with.

324
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,990
你想什么呢  湯姆·耶茨
Where'd you go, Tom Yates?

325
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,310
我找你來著
I was looking for you.

326
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,450
看來找得不夠用心啊
Not very hard, then.

327
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,750
我得跟你談談
I need to talk to you.

328
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,980
好
Okay.

329
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,860
我不干了
I'm done.

330
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,520
我不想再寫演講稿了
With the speechwriting, I don't want to do it anymore.

331
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,900
我想回去做我之前在做的其他事
I want to get back to some other stuff I was working on.

332
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,140
沒別的意思  我知道寫演講稿也是寫作
No offense. I mean, I know writing speeches is writing...

333
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,780
但這不是我真正想做的
but it's not what I really wanna do.

334
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,600
好
Okay.

335
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,190
你確定
You sure?

336
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,760
是的
Yes.

337
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,090
我們會把你調出去的
We'll transition you out.

338
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,030
但你以后再來就得想好借口了
But you'll need to have a reason to be here.

339
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,270
特別顧問  你逗我嗎
Special advisor? Are you kidding me?

340
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,660
有猜測說他已經...
There's speculation that he's already...

341
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,100
這不是猜測  賽斯
It's not speculation, Seth.

342
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,910
人們知道馬克·厄舍在某種程度上為我們工作
People know that Mark Usher is working for us in some capacity.

343
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,080
-那還不夠嗎  -把發布寫得好一點
- I mean, isn't that enough? - Clean up this release.

344
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,450
突破黨派界限之類的
Uh, reaching across party lines, that sort of thing.

345
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,080
-準備好  以防萬一  -當然
- And get it ready, just in case. - Of course.

346
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,070
就這樣
That's it.

347
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,860
我知道你不高興
I know you're not happy about this.

348
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,690
他憑什么能贏得那頭銜
What has he done to earn the title?

349
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,240
這不是他贏得什么的問題
This is not about him earning anything.

350
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,210
他已經在接觸機密備忘錄了  
He's already getting classified memos.

351
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,000
她為什么想這樣
Why does she want this?

352
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,870
"她"
"She"?

353
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,870
抱歉  我是說副總統
I'm sorry. The vice president.

354
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,580
她想要的是讓這個政府成功
What she wants is for this administration to succeed.

355
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,360
而我想要的是你跟他成為朋友  了解他
And what I want is for you to befriend him. Get to know him.

356
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,060
我們要讓他以為是他在操控我們
We want him to think he's managing us

357
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,010
而其實是我們在控制他
while we're busy managing him.

358
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,690
她追查弗蘭西斯·安德伍德很久了
She has been pursuing Francis Underwood for a long time.

359
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,920
-我不想和她談  -艾丹
- I don't wanna talk to her. - Aidan...

360
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,510
她怎么知道我在這兒的
How does she even know I'm here?

361
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,950
鮑德溫女士是個非常優秀的記者
Miss Baldwin is a very good journalist.

362
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,080
把事情公開對你和我都沒幫助
Yeah, going public will not help you, or me.

363
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,940
你就跟她說說  你是怎么操縱美國民意的
You'll tell her how you manipulated the American mood, hmm?

364
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,040
-你是怎么偷走大選勝利的  -那我就完了
- How you helped steal an election. - That would be it for me.

365
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,180
你可是我們俄羅斯聯邦的貴客
You're a valued guest of the Russian state.

366
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,900
我想要回我的護照
I want my passport back.

367
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,830
美國護照是絕對保護不了你的
An American passport is the last thing that will keep you safe.

368
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,250
我愿賭一把
I'll take my chances.

369
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,900
這下你要出名了  當個告密者
This will make you famous, hmm? A whistle-blower.

370
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,530
我不想出名
I don't wanna be famous.

371
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,370
但你想要自由
But you do want to be free.

372
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,070
你光飯錢就花了一萬五
You spent $15,000 at The Capital Grille?

373
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,040
你吃金子嗎
What the fuck are you eating?

374
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,950
-這是羅梅洛利用紀律委員會  -這是把柄
- This is Romero using the House Ethics... - It's a liability.

375
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,390
你就不該犯這種錯
And you should know better.

376
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,540
這事你怎么沒說過  泰瑞
How did you not disclose this, Terry?

377
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,930
我想把他踢出委員會
I want to pull him off his committee assignments.

378
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,870
扔進科學委員會  看他喜不喜歡宇航局報告
Put him on Science. See how he likes NASA briefings.

379
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,300
先緩緩吧
I'd like to hold off on that.

380
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,690
羅梅洛就要成為總統的親密盟友了
Romero's about to become an ally to the president.

381
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,320
怎么會呢
And why's that?

382
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,040
因為他能查出你的賬單有問題
Because he was able to find out about your tab.

383
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,440
因為他從不輕易放手
It's because he's relentless.

384
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,030
因為四年后亞利桑那州35%的選民是拉丁裔
Because in four years, 35% of the vote in Arizona will be Latino.

385
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,800
因為他就是未來
Because he's the future.

386
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,340
就是這么開始的
This is how it starts.

387
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,060
我得回國會去了
I gotta get back to the Hill.

388
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,430
跟你說  道格
You know, Doug...

389
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,890
你我都待得夠久  見過換護衛
you and I, we've been around long enough to see the guard change.

390
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,580
之所以會換人  是因為上頭那些人
And it changes because the people at the top

391
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,250
忘了自己是怎么爬上去的
forget how they got there.

392
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,290
羅梅洛也想換護衛  道格
Romero's trying to change the guard, Doug.

393
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,420
而我們就是護衛
And we are the guard.

394
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,180
要是烏麥克議員無所隱瞞
If Congressman Womack has nothing to hide,

395
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,690
那他就沒什么好怕的
he has nothing to fear.

396
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,410
我們都有要隱瞞的事  羅梅洛議員
We all have something to hide, Congressman Romero.

397
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,480
領導層該換人了
It's time for a change in the leadership.

398
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,940
總統想當你的朋友
The president would like to be a friend to you,

399
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,580
但你讓他很難做
but you're making it very difficult.

400
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,850
我們可以保證移民禁令
We can guarantee the immigration ban

401
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,560
下星期就會取消
will be lifted in the next week.

402
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,350
拜托  又來這一套嗎
Come on. Are we doing this again?

403
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,730
你開個種族歧視的條件
You offer me some racist gesture.

404
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,800
我怎么  就當死黨嗎  本來你也禁不住
And I, what? I'm a friend forever? Ban isn't even sustainable.

405
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,140
你最在乎的究竟是什么
What matters to you?

406
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,700
-總統的注意力  -你有啊
- The president's attention. - You have it.

407
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,300
-全部的注意力  -你過分了
- His full attention... - You know, that's enough.

408
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,210
你到底想要什么
What is it that you really want?

409
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,650
我想要醫保覆蓋率調回原來的水平
I want Medicare coverage bumped up to where it was.

410
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,520
我的選區有不少退休工人
There are retirees in my district.

411
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,460
你見我就只想要擴大醫保嗎
We're here now because you want a bump in Medicare?

412
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,430
得了吧  議員
Come on, Congressman.

413
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,850
還有兩個就職典禮的座位
And two seats to the inauguration.

414
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,200
-就剩兩天了  -講臺座位
- We are two days out. - On the dais.

415
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,080
你的算盤完全打錯了
You are going about this entirely wrong.

416
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,110
是你主動來找我  是你求我
You came here. You asked me.

417
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,620
我告訴你
I'm telling you.

418
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,080
我就想看弗蘭西斯·安德伍德當著我的面
I want to be there when Francis Underwood says to me

419
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,930
宣布提高醫保水平
that there will be an increase in Medicare.

420
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,900
只要他一句話  我就是他鐵哥們
He does that, I'm his friend.

421
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,270
那我現在就可以代表總統
Well, I think I speak for the president

422
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,260
告訴你這事根本不可能
when I say that's not going to happen.

423
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,510
斯坦普先生  我真的很欽佩你為他做的一切
Mr. Stamper, I really appreciate all the work you do for him,

424
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,010
但你我都知道我的黨團在擴大
but you and I know that my bloc is growing.

425
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,510
我只要求他在就職講話里說句話
All I'm looking for is a line in his address.

426
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,370
兩個座位  一句話
Two seats and a line.

427
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,290
-好大的膽子  -我告訴他基本沒可能
- The balls on him. - I told him it was highly doubtful.

428
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,940
我可以再回去正式拒絕他
I can get back to him with a firm no.

429
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,390
或者你可以答應他提一句
Or you could give him a line.

430
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,850
他的保證很不可靠
His promises are unreliable.

431
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,940
我了解艾力克斯  我們在康威競選時見過面
Look, I know Alex. We met on Conway's campaign.

432
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,580
只要他加入  就一定死心塌地
Once he's in, he's in.

433
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,620
總統先生  我們得謹慎決定要給出什么條件
Sir, we have to be very careful with what we're giving away.

434
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,560
他能給政府帶來
He's capable of giving this administration

435
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,800
巨大的困擾
an enormous amount of grief.

436
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,280
他只是想讓我們對他示好
He's asking for a gesture.

437
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,150
要我說可不止
Oh, I'd say it's a little more than that.

438
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,130
完全同意  他想找幫我們獲勝的人的麻煩
I completely agree. He's going after the people who got us here.

439
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,370
他并沒有錯  對嗎
He's not wrong, is he?

440
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,950
有些領導層的人確實該下臺了
There are some in leadership whose time has come and gone.

441
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,260
瞧  我是來確保
Look... I'm just here to make sure

442
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,290
你能連任的
your four years turn into eight, but...

443
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,880
但決定權還是在你手上
it's up to you, of course.

444
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,870
他要的不過是兩個座位  一句話 
But we're talking about two seats... one line...

445
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,570
答應他的要求
Give him what he wants.

446
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,110
艾力克斯
Alex.

447
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,500
蒂爾達  很高興見到你
Tilda. It's lovely to see you.

448
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,350
-你好嗎  議員  -挺好的
- How are you, Congressman? - Oh, I'm fine.

449
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,830
很高興你們都來了  今天是個大日子
It's good of you all to be here. It's a big day.

450
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,510
要不你們坐我的位子
Listen, why don't the two of you take my seats?

451
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,960
謝了  我們已經被安排在走道旁了
Oh, thanks, but we're already on the aisle.

452
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,160
你們務必收下
I insist.

453
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,950
這樣總統說到你想聽的話時
You'll be right in the president's line of vision when he...

454
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,590
你正好能與他對視
says what you want to hear.

455
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,540
請吧  我在哪都行
Please. I can be anywhere.

456
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,770
好吧
Okay.

457
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,740
-謝謝你  馬克  -別客氣
- Thank you, Mark. - Sure.

458
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,200
我  弗蘭西斯·安德伍德  莊嚴宣誓
I, Francis J. Underwood, do solemnly swear...

459
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,560
我  弗蘭西斯·安德伍德  莊嚴宣誓
I, Francis J. Underwood, do solemnly swear...

460
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,930
我必忠實執行...
That I will faithfully execute...

461
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,050
我必忠實執行...
That I will faithfully execute...

462
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,070
合眾國總統職務
The office of President of the United States.

463
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,400
合眾國總統...是的  這一幕似曾相識
The office of Pres-- Yes, here we go again.

464
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,200
國務卿  那時我是想要這個位子
Secretary of State. That's what I wanted.

465
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,930
我只想要這個位子  也是當時許諾給我的
That's all I wanted. That's what I was promised.

466
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,220
而現在  瞧瞧我
And now, here I am,

467
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,880
成了美國總統
President of these United States.

468
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
美國人民  這是你們促成的  
You made this bed, America.

469
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,110
是你們投票給我的
You voted for me.

470
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,160
困惑嗎
Are you confused?

471
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,170
害怕嗎
Are you afraid?

472
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,500
因為你以為的夢想成真了
Because what you thought you wanted is now here.

473
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,880
現在你在看著我
And there you are, staring back,

474
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,950
目瞪口呆  一頭霧水
slack-jawed, bewildered,

475
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,970
心想這究竟是不是你們想要的
wondering if this is what you actually asked for.

476
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,970
是民主  你們的民主選擇了我
This democracy, your democracy, elected me.

477
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,140
如果你覺得走到今天實屬不易
And if you think it was hard getting here,

478
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,450
你就能開始明白為了保住權位我會不惜一切
you're beginning to understand what I'm willing to do to stay.

479
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,860
我一眼望向擁擠的人群
I look across at this crowd gathered today

480
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,780
我很清楚他們不是我的支持者
and I know that these are not my supporters.

481
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,320
我看到的是一群臉上掛著微笑
I'm looking at people who are waiting,

482
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,940
等待著自己的機會來臨的人
with a smile on their face, for their turn.

483
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,670
那些笑得最開懷
And the most vicious among them

484
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,460
鼓掌最熱烈的人  也是其中最陰險的
are the ones who are smiling and clapping the hardest.

485
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,060
權力正如房地產  還記得嗎
Power is a lot like real estate. Remember?

486
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,000
-愿上帝助我  -愿上帝助我
- So help me God. - So help me God.

487
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,700
美國人民  我聽到了你們的聲音
America, I hear you.

488
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,860
我聽到了你們所有人的聲音
I hear all your voices.

489
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,640
我聽到了你們的掙扎  你們的擔憂
I hear your struggles, your concerns,

490
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,290
但最重要的是  我聽到了你們的希望
but most of all, I hear your hope.

491
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,140
每個人都希望得到機會和保障
Opportunity and security is what we all want.

492
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,160
所以在我上任后的百天之內  我會團結兩黨
And in my first 100 days, I will reach across party lines

493
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,180
讓我的政府  也是你們的政府
and devote my administration, your government,

494
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,780
保障你們的需要
to securing them.

495
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,220
老年人以及他們所依賴的
For too long we have ignored

496
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,250
醫療保險已經被我們忽視了太久
our seniors and the healthcare they depend on.

497
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,020
所以我要致力于改善醫保政策
That is why I am committed to fixing Medicare

498
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,930
取得成效前  我不會增加一毛錢預算
before I devote one more dime to the program.

499
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,720
《美就法》只是個開始
AmWorks was only the beginning.

500
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,110
我們得學會不再依賴福利津貼
We have to learn to live without entitlements,

501
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,930
因為我們不是不勞而獲的民族
because we are not an entitled people.

502
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,920
我相信你們的每一滴汗水  每一分耕耘
I believe in your sweat. I believe in your hard work.

503
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,110
我今天要向大家承諾的  就是就業機會
And a job, that's what I'll promise you today.

504
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,730
你連一句話都不能給他嗎
You couldn't give him one line?

505
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,530
對不忠誠的人我們一個子也不會給
We give no quarter to those that are disloyal.

506
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,070
今天傳達的信息不是針對他一人
The message sent today wasn't just for him.

507
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,180
-報仇會燃起艾力克斯的斗志  -我也是
- Alex feeds off of retribution. - So do I.

508
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,650
-他值得你引戰嗎  -沒有中間地帶
- Is he worth the fight? - There is no neutrality.

509
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,730
我要求完全的忠誠  不然你就是我的敵人
I expect total loyalty or you are an enemy.

510
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,390
明白了  總統先生 
Understood, Mr. President.

511
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,250
你怎么想
What are you thinking?

512
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,670
{\an9}BGM: My Country, 'Tis of Thee

513
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,360
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}又稱《America》  愛國歌曲
曾是默認的美國國歌

514
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,360
*讓人民發出聲音*
*Let mortal tongues awake*

515
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,250
*讓人民暢快呼吸*
*Let all that breathe partake*

516
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,090
*讓人民打破沉默*
*Let rocks their silent break*

517
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,150
我就是喜歡這些愛國的東西
I have a soft spot for that patriotic stuff.

518
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,750
請伸開手臂  岔開腿
Please spread your arms and legs.

519
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,820
什么
Excuse me?

520
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,450
否則  別想采訪
Otherwise, there is no interview.

521
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,890
還有  請你脫掉外套
And if you would please take off your jacket.

522
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,120
-我是個記者  -我知道
- I'm a journalist. - I know.

523
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,300
我住在倫敦時讀過你的報道
I read you when I was living in London.

524
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,330
-我不是間諜  -我知道
- So I'm not a spy. - I know you're not a spy.

525
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,640
現在還有人用那個詞嗎
Does anyone even use that word anymore?

526
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,750
采訪不會在這里進行
So the interview won't be happening here.

527
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,000
-我們說好的  -我們得帶你去另一個地方
- Uh, we agreed... - We need to move you to another location.

528
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,550
對不起  你不能用自己的人
Oh, and I'm sorry, you cannot use your own crew.

529
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,450
-這不可接受  -那采訪就得推遲
- That's unacceptable. - Then the interview will have to wait.

530
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,240
我們不能信任你們的人
We cannot trust your people.

531
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,230
你也不想讓麥卡倫先生有危險吧
And you wouldn't want to endanger Mr. Macallan, would you?

532
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,380
你來嗎  鮑德溫女士
Are you coming, Miss Baldwin?

533
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,490
你的手機得留下
And your cell phone needs to stay here.

534
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,610
謝謝
Thank you.

535
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,080
支持你的人很多
You have a lot of support out there,

536
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,380
不管總統說了  或沒說什么
no matter what the president did or didn't say.

537
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,860
有很多人樂意跟你合作
There are people eager to work with you.

538
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,930
我該告訴你
I should tell you...

539
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,570
我要煽動共和黨人
I'm encouraging the Republicans

540
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,760
重啟宣戰委員會
to restart the Declaration of War Committee,

541
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,190
調查總統
to investigate the president.

542
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,920
這很大膽
That's bold.

543
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,720
-我并不是想打動你  -很冒險
- I'm not trying to impress you with that. - It's risky.

544
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,640
你不想跟白宮的人為敵
You don't want an enemy in the White House.

545
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,230
但你現在在白宮了
But you're in the White House now.

546
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,510
你對我是什么
And you're what to me?

547
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,420
讓我幫你吧
Why don't you let me help you?

548
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,580
不非得讓其他人輸你才能贏
Everybody doesn't have to lose for you to win, right?

549
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,120
肖恩·杰弗瑞斯在嗎
Is Sean Jeffries there?

550
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,670
-誰找他  -你是誰
- Who's calling? - Who's this?

551
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,560
我為湯姆·漢默施密特工作
I work for Tom Hammerschmidt.

552
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,900
我不明白為什么把我轉接給你
I don't understand why I was transferred to you.

553
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,210
接待員是我的朋友  我認識他  她認識他
The receptionist is a friend of mine. I know him. She knows him.

554
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,000
我已經聯系他一天了
Well, I've been trying to reach him all day.

555
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,360
我可以替你捎話
I can take a message.

556
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,810
不用  我晚點再打吧
No, I'll try him later.

557
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,570
他已經不在這里工作了
Look, he doesn't work here anymore, so...

558
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,350
-我是他女朋友  -沒事的
- I'm his girlfriend. - That's all right.

559
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,220
-你是誰  -算了
- Who is this? - Don't worry about it.

560
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,180
我是賽斯·格雷森  我有料給你
Hey, it's Seth Grayson. I've got something for you.

561
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,930
莉安·哈維  要被趕走了
LeAnn Harvey, she's being pushed out.

562
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,610
嗯  她出局了
Yeah, she's out.

563
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,410
到了現在  你是唯一
Yeah, well, you're the only one

564
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,360
還得從我這兒聽來的人了
that's got me telling you at this point.

565
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,080
好吧  我正在寫發布稿
Okay. I'm writing the release right now.

566
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,500
好  再見
All right, bye.

567
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,240
我是賽斯·格雷森
Hey, it's Seth Grayson.

568
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,010
我有料給你
Yeah, I got something for you.

569
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,540
凱特·鮑德溫的人本來都準備好了
Kate Baldwin's people were ready to go,

570
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,690
但俄聯邦安全局換掉了她的人
but the FSB replaced the crew.

571
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,800
你牙上有東西
You have something on your tooth.

572
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,170
我們知道他們要去哪嗎
Do we know where they were going?

573
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,580
不  但他們還在受追蹤
No, but they're still being tracked.

574
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,090
凱特·鮑德溫就不該跟他說上話
Kate Baldwin was never supposed to talk to him.

575
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,190
-這采訪絕不能進行  -我們還有時間
- This interview cannot happen. - We still have time.

576
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,200
不  沒有了
No, we don't.

577
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,790
我們得介入
We need to go in.

578
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,290
這可能會產生難以預料的后果
And there might be some unforeseen consequences.

579
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,270
我覺得艾丹不會透露任何
I don't think Aidan would reveal anything

580
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,770
會傷害我  或其他人的信息
that would endanger me... or anyone else.

581
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,290
你跟他的交情有多久
How far back do you and he go?

582
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,990
很久
Far.

583
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,960
僅此而已
That's all.

584
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,430
很遺憾要如此結局
I'm sorry it has to end this way.

585
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,710
我不需要你的同情
I don't need your sympathy.

586
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,150
你快好了
You almost ready?

587
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,810
該死  我找不到我的F了

588
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,480
肯定是被人偷了
Someone must have stolen it.

589
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,050
肯定還會找到的
I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.

590

湯姆  你這身禮服真帥
Tom, you look very handsome in a tuxedo.

591
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,230
我裝作撐得起禮服的人
I act like a man that can wear a tuxedo

592
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,790
我突然就撐得起禮服了
and suddenly I'm a man who can wear a tuxedo.

593
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,130
先用這個湊合吧
This should do for now.

594
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,040
-我剛看到艾瑞克·羅林斯來了  -是啊

We'll have distance, Francis.

601
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,130
我們會欠她的
We'll owe her.

602
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,070
你很帥  很有總統氣質

你才美  有副總統的氣質

604
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,170
就是這晚  佐伊被殺的那晚
Here we are. The night of Zoe's death.

605
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,680
你覺得那是誰
Who does that look like to you?

606
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,050
一個等列車的普通白人
Just another white guy waiting for the train.

607
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,760
看仔細點
Look closer.

608
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,450
我知道你覺得那是誰  但我不能確定
I know who you think it might be, but... I'm really not sure.

609
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,010
關上門
Yeah, shut that door.

610
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,550
杰拉德·福特的兒子以前會
Gerald Ford's son used

611
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,700
偷偷溜上這些樓梯  去屋頂
to sneak up these stairs to go to the roof,

612
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,590
跟朋友演奏齊柏林飛艇
play Led Zeppelin to his friends.

613
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,530
少年就是少年  不管他在哪
Teenagers are teenagers, doesn't matter where.

614
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,050
這是
And this...

615
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,710
維克多·佩特羅夫摁滅雪茄的地方
is where Viktor Petrov put out his cigar.

616
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,730
那人似乎很不好對付
That guy seems like a real piece of work.

617
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,430
相信我  他的確是
Oh, believe me, he is.

618
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,460
你也是
So are you.

619
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,540
這就未必了
No, I don't know about that.

620
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,200
-你干什么  -對不起
- What are you doing? - Oh, I'm sorry.

621
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,400
你為什么說對不起
And what are you sorry about?

622
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,750
我以為你想要一樣  你并不想要的東西
I thought you wanted something that you don't.

623
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,750
你覺得我想要什么
So what is it that you think I wanted?

624
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,880
我們可以再上去  我真的...

據說  人體最脆弱的部分
You know, they say the most vulnerable part of the human body...

626
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,460
是喉嚨
is the throat...

627
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,700
你要想真正知道自己對某人的感覺
and that you never really know how you feel about somebody...

628
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,900
就需要那人掐著你的喉嚨
until they have their hands around your throat.

629
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,860
告訴我
So tell me.

630

恭喜  總統先生

632
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,940
以免我忘了  莉安·哈維讓我跟你打招呼
Before I forget, LeAnn Harvey wanted me to say hello.

633
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,580
她怎么樣
How is she?

634
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,260
她要我告訴你
Well, she wanted me to tell you

635
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,410
她沒事  她不會有事
that she's... she's all right. She's gonna be all right.

636
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,410
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

637
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,180
她現在  請假了
She's, um, taking a leave of absence.

638
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,430
至少他們是這么說的
Well, that's what they're calling it,

639
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,710
但看來
but it... it seems that

640
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,620
她被趕出政府了
she's being pushed out of the administration.

641
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,780
是她告訴我你在這兒的
She's the one who told me you were here.

642

叫我來跟你談談
Suggested I talk to you.

643
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,550
莉安雇了你  是吧
LeAnn hired you, isn't that right?

644
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,220
家族朋友
Friend of the family?

645
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:27,320
對  我們這就開始采訪了嗎
Yeah, um, are we starting the interview now?

646
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,280
不不  我們就聊聊  但應該就好了
No, no. We're just talking. But we should be ready soon.

647
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,150
對不起  我能...
I'm sorry. Can I, uh...

648
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,230
我們開始前  我能單獨待會兒嗎

00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,870
不  我就回來
No, I just... I just need a second, okay?

652
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,810
好啊  去喘氣吧
Of course. Get some air.

653
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,970
好
Okay.

654
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,760
我想借你的手機
I want your phone.

655
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,870
我想借你的手機  拿著
I need your phone. Take this.

656
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,750
一通電話
One call.

657
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,720
就一通
One.

658
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,090

天吶  艾丹
My God, Aidan.

661
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,980
我知道你有麻煩了  我們這么辦
I know you're in trouble. Here's the plan.

662
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,260
拿支筆  記下這號碼
All right. Get a pen. Write down this number.

663
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,510
他是個律師  他可以幫你出國
He... he's a lawyer. He can get you out of the country.

664
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,750
等你到了俄羅斯  我就能保護你
Once you're in Russia, I can protect you.

665
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,280
對不起

他們就在外面
They're right outside.

會有人受傷  你不會想那么做的
Uh, people will get hurt. You don't want to do that.

我喜歡德州
I like Texas.

672
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,700
或許是因為陽光或塵土
Maybe it's the sun or the dust,

673
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,580
但人們打招呼時都會瞇著眼
but people kind of squint when they say hello.

674
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,010
我一直喜歡那樣
I always liked that.

675

二樓有個守衛是我們的人
There's a guard on the second floor working with us.

684
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,130
上車就行

685
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,540
你不想念德州嗎
So you don't miss Texas?

686
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,410
不  我想
No, I do.

687
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,000
我想獲得安寧
I'm trying to find some peace with this

688
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,960

and you're not helping.

689
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,980
-就再問幾個問題  -我要搬走了
- Just a couple more questions. - I'm moving, you know.

690
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,540
-我得到了新工作  -巴恩斯先生
- I got a new job... - Mr. Barnes?

691
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,150
他們將你女兒的死判為意外
They ruled your daughter's death an accident.

692
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,030
我開始有所懷疑了
I am starting to doubt that.

693
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,160
-我們能不能再說一兩遍  -知道嗎
- Could we just go over one or two more... - You know what?

我不能再這么下去了
I just can't keep doing this.

695
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,630
別再給我打電話了
Stop calling me, please.

696
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,020
采訪不會進行了
The interview will not be happening.

會有人護送你回酒店

698
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,250

希望我沒來得太晚

這一切開始時  我可沒想過
Well, when all this started, I don't think I imagined myself

我們要去跟客人道別嗎
Shall we bid our guests farewell?

736
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,710
不  今晚還早呢
No, the night is young.

737
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,950
看我找到了什么
Look what I found.

738
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,350
他們要重啟委員會
They're restarting the committee.

739
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,440
我以為我們扼殺了那個委員會
I thought we killed that committee.

740
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,080
眾議院什么都野火燒不盡
Nothing ever really dies in the House.

741
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:07,680
只不過關注的人越來越少
It just plays in front of a smaller and smaller audience.

742
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,900
-這事可不小  -我知道
- This is serious. - I know.

743
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,420
但我們還是好好享受舞會吧
But let's enjoy the rest of the party.

744
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,090
你是做什么的
What do you do here?

745
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,240
我為他們工作
I work for them.

746
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,140
總統讓我確保你安全回家
The president asked me to make sure that you get home safely.

747
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,280
我給你安排了一輛車
I have a car for you.

748
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,380
我還想多待一會兒
I thought I'd stay a little while longer.

749
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,150
總統明天早上要早起
The president has an early morning tomorrow.

750
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,230
這邊請
Right this way.

751
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,050
那個導游
The tour guide?

752
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,060
-什么  -是的
- What?  - Yes.

753
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:37,350
搞什么  我應該拿那個導游怎么辦呢
WTF. What am I supposed to do about the tour guide?

754
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,090
還在媒體接待室  湯姆  不是吧
The press briefing room, Tom, really?

755
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,890
我以為沒人會在意
I didn't think anyone would care.

756
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:52,230
那我是該留下她還是讓她走人呢
Well, should I... keep her on or let her go?

757
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:55,960
她這樣做是很不專業的
I mean, it was rather unprofessional on her part.

758
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,520
她很擅長她的工作
She's good at her job.

759
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,460
湯姆...
Tom...

760
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,580
不要對我妻子不忠
don't cheat on my wife.

761
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,750
巴恩斯先生
Mr. Barnes?

762
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,740
你想到別的地方喝杯咖啡嗎
Do you want to get a coffee somewhere away from this?

763
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,790
我一直在想你說的話
I keep thinking about what you said.

764
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,430
我在她的東西中找到了這個
I found this with her things.

765
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,960
父親節那天
It was Father's Day...

766
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,690
是我最后一次跟她通話
the last time I heard from her.

767
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,850
我們不是很親近
We weren't close.

768
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,020
我很驚訝她會打電話給我
I was surprised she called.

769
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,670
我當然很開心  但是...
I mean, I was happy, of course, but...

770
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,770
我能留著這個嗎
Can I hold on to this?

771
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,200
我不知道
I didn't know...

772
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,600
她有麻煩了
that she was in trouble.

773
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,400
當警察問我她是不是有自殺傾向的時候
When the police asked if i thought she was suicidal,

774
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,840
我說  "可能吧"
I said, "Maybe."

775
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,570
我并不了解她
I didn't know her, really.

776
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,590
我也是
Neither did I.

777
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,650
我會調查這個的
I'll look into this.

778
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,970
好
Okay.

779
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,280

780
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:01,000
政治新聞網  《早安喬》上說了五分鐘
Politico. Five minutes on Morning Joe.

781
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,240
發新聞稿真的有必要嗎
Was a press release really necessary?

782
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,630
你要去休假
You're taking a leave.

783
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,980
新聞稿上說你要休假
The press release said that you were taking a leave

784
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,100
來考慮一下你的職業選擇
to consider your career options.

785
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,840
得看上去像真的才行  你知道的
This has to look real. You know that.

786
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,370
如果他們要和我見面怎么辦
What if they need to meet with me?

787
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,830
那他們就會和你見面
Then they'll meet with you.

788
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,100
我可以叫保安護送你出去
I could have security escort you out.

789
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,440
那么既然現在厄舍是特別顧問了
So since Usher is special advisor now,

790
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,010
那你又算什么呢
where does that leave you?

791
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:48,610
我說過了  如果有需要  他們會給打你的
Like I said, they'll call you if they need you.

792
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,730
我可以成為你的朋友的  知道嗎
I can be a friend to you, you know.

793
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,340
不必這樣的
It doesn't have to be like this.

794
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,750
我沒有朋友
I don't have any friends.

795
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,480
我把他安排在了巴黎的約旦大使館
I landed him at the Jordanian Embassy in Paris.

796
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,960
我們計劃什么時候把他弄出來
When do we plan to get him out?

797
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,450
據我所知  現在還不知道
Well, as I understand it, you don't yet know

798
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,480
麥卡倫先生可能告訴了佩特羅夫總統些什么
what Mr. Macallan may have told President Petrov.

799
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,450
我要麥卡倫回來  越快越好
I want Macallan back here sooner rather than later.

800
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,400
這些事不發生在美國境內會更好些
It's better if these things don't happen on American soil.

801
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:39,980
是  但我決定了
Yes, but I make those decisions.

802
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,790
當然  總統先生
Of course, Mr. President.

803
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,480
請放心
And rest assured,

804
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,510
這件事是查不到你們身上的
neither of your fingerprints are anywhere near this.

805
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,600
我們怎么處理莉安
So what do we do about LeAnn?

806
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:04,290
她參與了選舉舞弊  天吶
She's been involved in election fraud, for Christ's sake.

807
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,300
她犯了很多錯
She's made a lot of mistakes.

808
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,070
是的  但很多人都犯過
Yes, but lots of people have.

809
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,670
話是那么說  但有些人就走到頭了
Yes, but some people run their course.

810
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,050
如今真難知道能相信誰
It's hard to know who to trust these days.

811
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:20,970
可不是嘛
Isn't it?

813
00:52:30,230 --> 00:53:30,230
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}美國聯邦政府內閣包括副總統在內  目前共24名成員
其中負責國家安全的  如國務卿  國土安全部長  國防部長  被認為最重要
此外司法部長  財務部長也是比較重要的位置
而交通部長  農業部長  教育部長等  被認為是相對次要的職位
但因為現任總統特朗普在競選時承諾
上任后將進行總值1萬億美元的基礎建設投資
所以交通部長在現政府中地位較高
現任交通部長是華裔趙小蘭  她丈夫麥康諾是參議院多數黨領袖
許多媒體認為  特朗普任命趙小蘭負責交通部
除了因她在小布什政府任職時  表現優異之外
也可能是希望在基建政策上獲得麥康諾的支持

815
00:53:30,230 --> 00:54:30,230
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}"醫保改革"過去八年來一直是美國政治斗爭的核心議題
奧巴馬的新醫保法案在2010年通過后
就一直遭右翼政客及共和黨選民的反對
共和黨也借此先后奪回了國會兩院的控制權
特朗普競選時  一再承諾上臺后會推翻和替代原有的醫保法案
但上任后  實際操作卻困難重重  現在的替代法案能否通過尚無定數
同時  現有的醫保制度在美國社會遇到了大麻煩
2009年推行法案時  奧巴馬稱法案通過后  保費會大幅降低
但法案施行后  不僅保費年年暴漲  而且由于醫保公司虧損嚴重
在進入2017年后  美國一些地區的百姓已經無法購買"奧巴馬醫保"
所以替代方案也是勢在必行了
