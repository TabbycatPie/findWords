- Hey, Cam. - Louise, what are you doing here?

29
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,790
你不会是不来
You're not dropping out of the 

30
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,940
参加今晚的比赛了吧
league championship tonight, are you?

31
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,930
路易丝不来参加比赛了吗
Louise is dropping out of the league championship?

32
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,480
你又开枪打中了自己的腿吗
Did you shoot yourself in the leg again?

33
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,520
天啊  我和我的第一个体育奖杯之间
Oh, my God, we're one win away 

34
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,640
只隔着一场胜利的距离
from my first sports trophy,

35
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,670
结果发生了这种破事
and then this happens.

36
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,250
我只说了"你好  小卡"而已
All I said was "Hey, Cam."

37
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,350
今年我邀请了米奇尔
So, this year, I invited Mitchell

38
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,880
参加我的同性恋保龄球队  小甜甜·击倒你队
to join my gay bowling team -- the Britney Spares.

39
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,070
队名是我想的  队服是我设计的
I came up with the team name, I designed the shirts.

40
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,390
-是啊  -谁得到荣誉并不重要
- Yeah. - It's not important who gets the credit.

41
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,660
我们刚开始时  我的保龄球技烂透了
When we first stated, my bowling was, um -- well, it was iffy.

42
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,590
但我一直练习
But then I practiced and I practiced

43
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,050
直到球馆租鞋的人说我"挺像样"
until the shoe-rental guy called me "Decent."

44
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,850
我不是作为队员来的
I'm not here as a teammate.

45
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,150
-而是来办警察公务的  -什么
- I'm here on official police business. - What?

46
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,220
拜托告诉我这不是你
Please tell me that is not you.

47
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,850
那是什么
What is that?

48
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,400
不
Oh, no.

49
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,650
不  不  不
No, no, no.

50
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,970
那是菲茨宝
Hmm. That's Fizbo...

51
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,500
-是啊  -戴着可怕的面具
- Mm-hmm. - ...with a scary mask.

52
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,570
-很明显不是我  -不是他
- That's clearly not me. - It's not him.

53
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,190
不  谁会做这种事啊
No! Who would do that?

54
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,770
谁会把这么美好的东西
Who would take something so beautiful

55
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,030
变得这么丑恶
and turn it into something so ugly?

56
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,840
那人怎么拿到那套小丑服的
How did the guy get the costume?

57
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,920
谁知道
Oh, who knows?

58
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,410
你二爸把它捐给了慈善机构
Your father gave it to charity.

59
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,550
是意外
By accident.

60
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,300
我怎么没听到这场吵架
How did I not hear that fight?

61
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,360
我当时在家吗
Was I in town?

62
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,760
那好吧  结案了
All right, then, uh, case closed.

63
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,880
今晚见
I'll see you guys tonight.

64
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,970
什么  怎么能就此"结案"
What? No "Case closed."

65
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,440
我们还没找到罪犯呢
We haven't even found the perp!

66
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,100
听着  我跟进这个案子的唯一原因
Look, the only reason I was following up on this

67
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,890
就是因为我觉得这可能是你
is 'cause I thought it might be you.

68
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,400
但我们得拿回我的小丑服
Well, yeah, but we have to get my costume back.

69
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,230
帮菲茨宝恢复名誉
We have to restore Fizbo's good name.

70
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,560
但是我们还要去打保龄球的  对吧
Oh, but we're -- we're still gonna go bowling, right?

71
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,900
你捐了我心爱的第二人格
You give away my beloved alter ego,

72
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,370
还不肯给我30秒
and you won't even allow me 30 seconds

73
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,060
让我有情绪反应吗
to have an emotional reaction?

74
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,180
我说那句话时就觉得没过脑子
Yeah. No, it sounded fast as I was saying it.

75
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,940
现在是最后一块
And now for the finishing touch.

76
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,990
给弗兰克的弗兰克牌巧克力塔
Franks for Frank!

77
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,230
我爸的单身派对一定会超赞
Dad's bachelor party's gonna be epic.

78
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,180
你看不出来  所以  击掌
You couldn't see it. That's why -- boom!

79
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,230
鸡肉卷  白葡萄酒  软糕
Chicken wraps, white wine, fudge.

80
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,470
这是单身汉派对
Is this a bachelor party

81
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,110
还是女人坐着看相亲节目《单身汉》的派对
or a party where ladies sit around watching "The Bachelor"?

82
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,220
你为什么给我订XXXL的衣服
And why did you get me a triple-XL?

83
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,630
{\an8}衣服上写着"我老实跟你说/让我当弗兰克"

84
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,630
导购说洗后会缩水
The lady said it'd shrink in the wash.

85
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,320
-它在垃圾堆里会怎么样  -杰
- How's it gonna do in the trash? - Jay.

86
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,820
开玩笑的  我会用它来当洗车布
Kidding. I'll use it to wash my car.

87
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,540
我爸爸要跟我儿时保姆洛林结婚了
My dad is marrying my old babysitter Lorraine,

88
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,600
而她有个儿子
who has a son,

89
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,720
也就是说我终于要有弟弟了
which means that I am finally getting a brother!

90
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,520
我小时候好想要个弟弟
When I was young, I wanted a brother so much,

91
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,370
我父母给我买了双层床
my folks got me bunk beds.

92
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,680
晚上我会装作我弟弟睡在上层  并跟他聊天
At night, I'd pretend he was up there and talk to him,

93
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,880
他不回答我时  我就想着
and when he didn't answer back, I always just figured,

94
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,430
"马蒂又闹脾气了"
"Well, Marty's in a mood again."

95
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,310
请问这里供应螃蟹[服务坏脾气的人]吗
Excuse me. Do you serve crabs here?

96
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,940
我们为任何人提供服务
We serve anyone.

97
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,760
笑话变老哏是因为它们真的好笑  对吧
Jokes only get old because they're good, right?

98
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,150
说得很好
Nailed it.

99
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,430
菲尔  这是雷
Phil, this is Ray.

100
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,940
看来我们要成为兄弟了
Wow. I guess we're gonna be brothers.

101
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,370
来吧
Bring it in.

102
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,840
不  怎么回事
Oh! No. Oh! What's happening?

103
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,830
我们是兄弟  兄弟不都这样吗
We're brothers! Isn't this what brothers do?

104
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,600
我不知道  但我喜欢
I don't know, but I love it!

105
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,960
这人想摸我的小鸡鸡
This guy totally tried to touch my ding-dong.

106
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,910
我都不知道这是那种派对
I didn't know it was that kind of party.

107
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,210
因为你没看见娘炮的白葡萄酒和软糖吧
I guess you didn't see the white wine and fudge.

108
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,750
白葡萄酒  那可掰不弯我
White wine? That's not gonna get me there.

109
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,580
只有我觉得我今晚
Am I the only one who sees me

110
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,760
会把那家伙掐死吗
choking that guy out tonight?

111
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,730
我不知道
I don't know.

112
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,260
我觉得雷挺不错
I got a good feeling about Ray,

113
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,650
而他对我也挺"激烈"的
and I-I felt a lot of him.

114
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,300
他只是一路坐车过来憋坏了
He's just a little wound up from the drive.

115
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,550
你肯定会发现他是个良好市民的
I'm sure you'll find he's a real solid citizen.

116
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,850
走廊对面的傻瓜没关门
The sap across the hall left his door open.

117
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,810
那是我的房间
That's my room!

118
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,940
看来我得把这瓶药还给你了
Oh. So, I guess you'll need these.

119
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,180
在我们开始前  谢谢大家
Before we start, thanks for agreeing

120
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,240
同意来读我的最新剧本
to do this read through of my latest play,

121
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,430
《深秋满月下的讽刺告别》
"A withering farewell under a harvest moon"...

122
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,090
朗朗
So catch-

123
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,600
冒号  《天使之泪》
...Colon, "The tears of angels."

124
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,380
-朗朗上口  -是吧
- So catchy! - Right?

125
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,270
故事讲的是四个女人为了
It's a story of four women who come together

126
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,050
哀悼逝去的一家之主而相聚
to mourn the loss of the family patriarch.

127
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,400
不  太悲伤了  实在太悲伤了
Oh, no. So sad, so very sad.

128
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,620
慢慢来  疯婆子  我们还没开始呢
Pace yourself, crazy. We haven't even started.

129
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,380
有人去世了  克莱尔
A man died, Claire.

130
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,370
虚构的人
A fake man,

131
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,690
如果他是家族大家长  那就是虚构的老头子
and if he was a patriarch, he was a fake old man,

132
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,950
老头子死了
And old men die.

133
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,210
这个想法
Surely, this is a thought

134
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,780
肯定时不时浮现在你的脑海中  对吧
that has occurred to you from time to time, huh?

135
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,620
请别把我牵扯进来
Please don't make me part of this.

136
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,700
无论如何  读完后
Anyway, when it's over,

137
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,200
尽管分享你们的看法
feel free to share your thoughts --

138
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,420
你们喜欢的  喜爱的部分
what you liked, what you loved,

139
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,660
但也要分享负面看法
but also the negatives --

140
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,990
你们看不懂的部分  不认识的字
What went over your head, any words you didn't know.

141
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,630
我要把最新剧本投稿到青年剧作家文化节
I'm submitting my latest play to a young playwrights festival,

142
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,120
但我想先听人读一遍
but I want to hear it out loud first

143
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,150
以确保所有情感都写到位了
to be sure I've hit all my emotional marks.

144
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,670
或许有人会问  "为什么全是女性角色"
One might ask, "Why all female characters?"

145
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,450
姑且说是懂什么写什么吧
Let's just say, write what you know.

146
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,610
等等  为避免歧义  我是了解女性
Wait. To clarify, I understand women.

147
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,220
不是自我认同为女人
I don't feel like I am one.

148
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
110页吗
110 pages?

149
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,590
我们要读到几点才能走啊
What time are we supposed to get out of here?

150
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,190
亲爱的  难不成今晚帅哥有约吗
Oh, honey, you got a hot date tonight?

151
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,550
妈  别这么刻薄  别理她
Mom, don't be mean. Ignore her.

152
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,370
其实我还真交了个男朋友
I actually am in a relationship,

153
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,730
但我一直瞒着所有人
but I've been hiding it from everybody

154
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,130
因为这次我又选了一个
because I have once again chosen somebody

155
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,550
特别不合适的交往对象
that is completely inappropriate.

156
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,200
他叫本  年纪比较大
It's this older guy -- Ben.

157
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,830
他为我妈工作  还和他妈住在一起
He works for my mother, and he lives with his mother.

158
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,760
我总像个扑火的飞蛾
I'm like a moth to a flame

159
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,080
而火指的是不上进
if the flame is an underachieving man-child

160
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,480
屁股上还有卡通人物纹身的妈宝男
with a tasmanian devil tattoo on his butt.

161
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,310
抱歉  这事要拖得比我预想得久
Sorry, this is going to take longer than I expected.

162
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,160
你能在那等我吗
Can you wait there?

163
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,830
没问题
Sure.

164
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,200
反正我妈也把她的牌友闺蜜都叫到家里去了
My mom's got her poker girls over, anyway.

165
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,840
有个叫凯伦的女人总是对我毛手毛脚
This one lady, Karen, she gets real handsy with me.

166
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,140
她也不算没有魅力吧
She's not un-hot, either.

167
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,490
她就像更老更丰满印度版的艾米莉·布朗特
She's like an older, curvy Emily Blunt but Indian.

168
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,490
{\an8}美国女演员  曾以《穿普拉达的女王》

169
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,180
别妄想能让我吃醋  本
Don't try to make me jealous, Ben.

170
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,470
我在咖啡店的一个常客
One of my regulars at the coffee shop

171
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,020
总问我想不想乘汽艇
is always asking if I want to do some motorboating.

172
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,750
{\an8}"汽艇"也能指把脸埋在巨乳里并发出汽艇的声音

173
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,750
要不是我会晕船  我就同意了
If I didn't get seasick, I'd go.

174
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,320
我不想把话说得太早
Now, okay, I don't want to get ahead of myself,

175
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,360
但奖杯上有每个队员的名字吗
but does the trophy have each of our names,

176
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,660
还是只有队名
or is it just the team name,

177
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,710
因为我有点想要一个自己的奖杯  但
'cause I kind want one of my own, but --

178
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,340
算了  没事  到时我自己找人刻上去
You know what? No, never mind. I'll just get it engraved.

179
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,570
都到了这种时候  
Okay, how can you be thinking

180
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,800
你怎么还能只想着保龄球
about bowling at a time like this?

181
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,400
你是指马上要打保龄球比赛的这种时候吗
You mean as we're going in to our bowling championship?

182
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,420
来短信了
Oh. Text message.

183
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,850
读短信
Read text message.

184
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,450
您有一条来自马丁的短信

"I keep picturing you guys holding the trophy later tonight.

186
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,550
逗你玩
Just kidding.

187
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,800
我不会请你们来我的庆功派对的
You're not invited to my victory party.

188
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,690
哈哈"
Ha ha."

189
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,650
你好  马丁
Hello, Martin.

190
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,280
你好  卡梅隆  你好  米奇尔

191
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,910
小甜甜·基佬妮队其余的人呢
Where's the rest of Britney Queers?

192
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,640
是小甜甜·击倒你队  马丁
It's the Britney Spares, Martin.

193
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,370
小甜甜·基佬妮队几周前就被淘汰了
The Britney Queers were eliminated weeks ago.

194
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,460
是的  被我们淘汰的
Yes, by us.

195
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,650
最终  所有人都将成为
Eventually, all will fall

196
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,210
我们基城保龄球手的手下败将
to the Gay City Bowlers.

197
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,000
我记不清了  所有球队名都必须用双关吗
I forget. Do all the names have to be puns?

198
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,320
是的  就像理发店名一样
Yes. It's like hair salons.

199
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,220
一如既往的不幸会  马丁
Unpleasant as always, Martin.

200
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,490
咱们在球馆[小巷]里见
I'll see you in the alley.

201
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,290
这话你对不少男人都说过吧
I'm sure you say that to a lot of men.

202
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,790
米奇尔  是菲茨宝
Mitchell! Fizbo!

203
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,240
-什么  -就在那边
- What? - Over there!

204
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,890
小卡  你觉得有没有可能
Cam-Cam, do you think it's possible

205
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,730
是你太纠结菲茨宝的事
with how upset you are about Fizbo

206
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,480
所以可能出现了幻觉
that-that maybe you're seeing things?

207
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,210
才不是
Oh. No.

208
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,910
也许世上还有另一个紫头发穿60号鞋的人
Maybe it's another guy with purple hair and a size 23 shoe.

209
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,640
或许丹尼斯·罗德曼也在这打保龄球呢

詹姆斯·皮克特客厅里的灯亮着

家具和陈设告诉我们他是个有钱人

214
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,420
但钱买不来品味

215
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,900
四个穿着黑色衣服的女人走了进来
Enter four women in black

然后是贝莉  他的外孙女
Next is Bailey, the granddaughter --

222
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,900
可爱又聪明

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,910

最后是詹姆斯的女儿  凯特

迷人  认真  毒舌

230
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,690
热情转瞬即逝
fleeting moments of warmth.

231
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,470
热情转瞬即逝
Fleeting moments of warmth?

232
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,620
我明白了
I get it.

233
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,220
这就是在讲我们四个人
This is the story of the four of us

234
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,030
不过套上了一层曼尼改编版滤镜

235
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,250
就因为我聪明  我就得是老处女吗

你知道如果我会不晕船的话

237
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,560

凯特一进来就直接到了书橱面前
Kate enters and crosses straight to the credenza,

243
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,870
迫不及待地给自己倒了一杯红酒
as she pours herself a much-needed glass of wine...

244
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,460
好吧
Mm. Right.

说实话  我真不敢相信

我的第一句词就是说我死去父亲的坏话

249

你觉得我是有多冷漠啊
How cold do you think I am?

250
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,170
我刚不是说了  不是你吗
Didn't I just say it's not you?

251
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,260
难道不是吗
Isn't it, though?

252
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,190
什么
What?

253
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,020
老人去世不算事儿

那不是你20分钟前说的吗
That was, like, 20 minutes ago.

255

等下

感觉你们还得吵一会儿
Okay, this seems like a whole thing,

257
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,380
我去喝个水  很快
so I'm just gonna go grab a water real quick.

258
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,400
不是吧
Oh, come on.

没谁
Ahh! No one.

261
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,980
-我只是在看我的星座运程  -骗人
- I'm just reading my horoscope. - Liar.

262
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,730
哪会有人这么晚看自己的星座运程

事情都已经发生完了
Everything's already happened.

264

272
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,600
不  他成年了
No. He's legal.

273
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,490
只是在其他方面让人有点尴尬
He's just embarrassing in a different way.

274
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,170
你知道吗  你从小到大一直这样
You know you've been like this your whole life --

275
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,980
对浪漫与情欲方面的自己感到羞耻
ashamed of the romantic, sexual part of you.

276

说实话  感觉像你觉得自己不配有爱情一样

277
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,810
但你配啊
but you do.

278
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,670
如果这个男生有趣  对你也不错

这现在在上演什么感情大戏
what emotional thing is playing out right now,

284
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,750
但保留一下情感  用在戏剧上如何

她把他养胖
She's getting him fat

289
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,450
这样把它当午饭吃掉时更美味

那又怎样  我这人搞笑也是罪吗
Yeah, so what? My crime is I'm hilarious?

291

这个你不用担心

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,470
{\an8}Mr.Sandman - The Chordettes

310
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,470
* 睡魔先生  给我个梦中情人 *
* Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream *

311
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,440
* 要让他是我见过最帅的人 *
* Make him the cutest that I've ever seen *

312
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,520
* 赐他两瓣玫瑰与三叶草般的嘴唇 *
* Give him two lips like roses and clover *

313
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,180
* 告诉他那些寂寞的夜晚... *
* Then tell him that his lonesome nights... *

314
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,310
你在做什么
What are you doing?!

315
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,800
宣布死亡时间
Calling time of death.

316
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,810
不是你们  女士们
Oh, not you ladies.

317
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,550
你们当然还活力充沛
You're still very vital, of course.

318
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,660
我们真的很感谢
Hey, we really appreciate

319
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,580
你们在战时为国家做的贡献
all the riveting you did during the war.

320
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,090
老爸正享受呢
Dad was enjoying them.

321
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,340
走了也行
Just as well.

322
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,910
我就要结婚了
I'm about to be married.

323
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,160
我没必要被那些臀臀臀[棒棒棒]诱惑
I don't need to be tempted by all those bum, bum, bums.

324
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,230
你准备的活动就这些了吗
Oh, is that it for the planned activities?

325
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,690
不  好戏才刚开始
No, we're just getting started.

326
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,680
接下来一小时玩赌注五美元的乌诺牌
For the next hour, it's a $5 buy-in game of Uno,

327
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,920
然后下楼去老船长餐厅
then downstairs to Captain Scupper's,

328
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,690
吃沙漠中最好的牡蛎
the best oysters in the desert.

329
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,850
最后  先生们  打上领带
And finally, put on your neckties, gentlemen,

330
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,280
因为我有四张楼座票去看尼尔...
'cause I have four balcony seats to Mr. Neil...

331
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,320
拜托是戴蒙德[歌手]
Please say "Diamond."

332
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,380
萨达卡[歌手]
...Sedaka.

333
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,700
多么丰富的夜晚
What a night!

334
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,350
我们冰不够了
Oh, we need some ice.

335
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,340
我去去就回
I'll be right back.

336
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,870
乌诺牌是什么
What the hell's Uno?

337
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,100
有点像用脑版的"疯狂八点"游戏
Sort of a thinking man's Crazy Eights.

338
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,820
与其在这里玩桌游牌
Instead of playing cards up here,

339
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,820
楼下有家赌场  还有我们大人该喝的烈酒
there is a casino downstairs with actual big-boy drinks.

340
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,920
我跟他去
I'm right behind him.

341
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,770
我们路上叫上菲尔
We'll grab Phil on the way.

342
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,090
或者让他找我们  他应该觉得更有趣吧
Or wouldn't it be fun for him to try and find us?

343
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,200
他肯定会喜欢的
Oh, he'll love that!

344
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,050
路易丝  我刚看到那个变态的冒名小丑
Hey, Louise, I just saw that psycho imposter clown

345
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,810
在外面垃圾箱旁恐怖地瞪着我
out by the dumpster giving me threatening looks.

346
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,560
-听着  肥子宝...  -是菲茨宝
- Look, Flouncy... - It's Fizbo.

347
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,650
我说的是你
I'm talking to you.

348
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,240
我没时间听你废话什么小丑
I don't have time for your clown nonsense.

349
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,760
我们要赢下冠军
We've got a championship to win.

350
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
我去跟球瓶[靛蓝]女孩队一起暖身了
I'm gonna go warm up with the pindigo girls.

351
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,150
为什么这非要在今天发生呢
Why does this have to be happening today?

352
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,590
米奇尔  或许就因为是今天才发生的
Mitchell, maybe it's happening because it's today.

353
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,720
或许有人想扰乱我思绪
Maybe somebody is trying to get in my head

354
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,310
让我不能好好比赛
to throw me off my game.

355
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,240
亲爱的  你真以为有人会在意到...
Oh, honey, do you really think people care enough to --

356
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,830
光现在就能看到有六个人
Hey, you know what, there are six people just in my eyesight

357
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,830
会不惜一切破坏我的连胜
that would do anything to break my winning streak.

358
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,730
比如  马丁
For instance, Martin.

359
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,810
他从没原谅我
He's never forgiven me

360
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,740
让他误以为你爸爱他那事
for making him feel like your father was in love with him.

361
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,730
不可能是马丁
Okay, it couldn't have been Martin.

362
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,760
我们看到他之后刚过三秒
We saw him, like, three seconds

363
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,950
你就以为你见到菲茨...
before you thought that you saw Fiz--

364
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,910
-是真的看到  -好吧
- Actually saw. - Okay.

365
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,950
他跟我爸是怎么回事来着
And what's this about my dad?

366
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,470
行行  不是马丁
Fine. It's not Martin.

367
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,630
但绝对有可能是卡普兰先生
But it certainly could be Senor Kaplan.

368
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,070
一  二  三  四  五  六[西语]
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis.

369
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,220
你好  卡普兰先生
Hola, Senor Kaplan.

370
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,080
你要是来呛声  我没兴趣听
If you're here to talk trash, I'm not interested.

371
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,100
你20分钟前在哪里
Where were you 20 minutes ago,

372
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,780
有谁能证明你的行踪吗
and can anybody account for your whereabouts?

373
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,930
虽然不关你事
Not that it's any of your business,

374
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,450
但我刚去照相亭拍单人照去了
but I happened to be in the photo booth taking some solos.

375
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,230
我新护照照片要用第三张
I'm gonna use number three for my new passport.

376
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,150
要我就用第二张  眼里闪烁着光芒
I would use number two. There's a twinkle in your eye.

377
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,220
但我认为你20分钟前
But I have a different theory

378
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,690
是在别的地方
as to where you were 20 minutes ago,

379
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,000
而且你会有刚好足够的时间
and it would have given you exactly enough time

380
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,230
换下小丑服  穿上保龄球服...
to change out of a clown costume into your bowling outf--

381
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,300
-怎么了  -不不不
- What's wrong? Wha... - No. No, no.

382
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,860
我刚看到  看到菲  菲茨宝
I just saw -- I just saw Fi-- Fizbo

383
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,100
出现在  在镜子里
in -- in -- in the mirror.

384
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,630
我不知道你是怎么回事  塔克
I don't know what's going on with you, Tucker,

385
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,470
但用我的家乡话来说就是"脑子疯了"[西语]
but in my culture, we like to call it loco en la cabeza.

386
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,370
行了  别装了  你是加拿大人
Okay, you know what? Knock it off. You're Canadian.

387
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,330
"你们似乎都忘了我并不孤独  我有艾伯特
"You all seem to forget I'm not alone. I have Albert.

388
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,440
我敢打赌你搜遍全世界
You can search the world,

389
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,570
也找不到另一更忠诚  更深情的...
and I defy you to find a more devoted, loving...

390
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,460
鹦鹉"
Parrot."

391
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,500
"我以前很喜欢跟阿尔伯特聊天
"I used to like talking to Albert,

392
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,760
可后来我们因为一块饼干吵了架"
but then we got into a fight over a cracker."

393
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,210
"两人看着这个寡妇伤心地敲击琴键时
"Kate whispers to Bailey as they watch the widow

394
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,150
凯特对贝莉说"
sadly plunking notes on the piano."

395
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,340
"咱们还得陪她多久
"How long do we have to stay with her?

396
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,220
我们可以走了吧"
We can leave now, right?"

397
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,830
"我早知道要是你爸死了
"I knew when your papa died,

398
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,990
你就绝对不会再来看我了"
I would never see you again."

399
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,990
"不论我做了什么
"No matter what I do,

400
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,880
你就是拒绝接受我已接受了你"
you refuse to accept that I accepted you."

401
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,750
"没这回事
"Mais non.

402
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,830
抱歉
I'm sorry.

403
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,220
我今天心情太百感交集了"
I'm just so emotional today."

404
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,910
"你心情复杂是应该的  克洛伊
"But of course you are, Chloe.

405
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,300
很抱歉我让你觉得自己是个外人"
And I'm sorry if I made you feel like an outsider."

406
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,040
"我爱你  你知道吗  我爱你"
"I love you, you know? Je t'aime."

407
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,610
"我也爱你"
"I love you, too."

408
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,020
灯光灭
Black out.

409
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,510
太棒了  太棒了
Bravo! Bravo!

410
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,770
你不是吧  曼尼
Really, Manny?

411
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,400
我的角色为了一块饼干跟鹦鹉吵了一架
My character gets into a fight with a parrot over a cracker?

412
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,220
我把这故事当秘密告诉你的
I told you that story in confidence.

413
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,960
姐告诉你
And for the record...

414
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,960
我一点也不像我的角色
I am nothing like my character.

415
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,040
姐一点也不孤独
I'm not lonely at all.

416
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,330
追我的人排队排老长了
I have tons of options.

417
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,760
我现在就要去见一个
I'm actually going to see one right now.

418
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,640
多亏了海莉
And thanks to Haley,

419
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,230
我再也不会羞于谈他了
I'm no longer ashamed of talking about him.

420
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,410
是谁啊
Ooh! Who is it?

421
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,640
-没谁  -叫什么名字
- No one. - What's his name?

422
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,290
没什么
Nothing.

423
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,350
好吧  如果没有其他反馈的话...
Well, if that's it for the feedback...

424
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,070
-我还有  其实  -好吧
- No, actually... - Oh. Yay.

425
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,400
我觉得结尾有点老套
For me, the ending felt a little trite.

426
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,820
有很多好的部分
There's a lot of good stuff in there,

427
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,940
但是那一大堆"对不起  对不起
but the whole "I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

428
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,720
我爱你  我爱你"的  我只是
I love you, I love you" -- I just --

429
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,880
觉得女人心思比那更复杂一些
I think women are more complicated than that.

430
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,650
别听她胡说  曼尼
Don't listen to her, Manny.

431
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,990
结尾很好
The ending was beautiful.

432
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,060
只是有些女人不善于
It's just that some women have a hard time

433
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,150
表达自己的感情
expressing their feelings.

434
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,980
又来了
Oh, this again?

435
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,120
歌洛莉亚  我可是很善于表达的人
Gloria, I'm a very feeling person.

436
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,780
是吗
Oh, really?

437
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,760
你在给我的生日贺卡上就写
From the woman that writes in my birthday cards

438
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,230
"祝好  克莱尔"
"Best, Claire."

439
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,230
这怎么不暖心了
How is that not warm?

440
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,490
我可是在给你最"好"的祝福
I am wishing you quite literally the best.

441
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,080
我是你家人
I am a person in your family.

442
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,780
不是给你修眉毛的
I am not the woman that does your eyebrows.

443
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,040
我为什么会给修眉毛的送生日贺卡
Why would I send her a birthday card?

444
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,220
问题是  你为什么不写"爱你的克莱尔"
The question is why can't you write "Love, Claire"?

445
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,920
我都会写"爱你的歌洛莉亚"
I write "Love, Gloria."

446
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,250
还在"我"上点了一大颗心
I even dot the "I" with a huge heart.

447
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,890
我对你说我爱你  你回我"我也是"
I tell you that I love you, and you say "Me, too."

448
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,190
为什么  你为什么就是不能说你爱我
Why? Why can't you tell me that you love me?

449
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,160
我也不知道为什么我说不出口
I don't know why I can't tell you that I --

450
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,920
我有段时间愿意说的
There was a time when I wanted to,

451
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,480
但错过了那时刻  再加上时光流逝
and then the moment passed and time went by

452
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,370
再说就感觉很刻意
and then it just felt forced.

453
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,060
你整天说这句话
You -- you say it all the time.

454
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,810
某些人会觉得反而稀释了话中感情呢
One could argue that dilutes it.

455
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,000
所以是我的错
Oh, so now it's my fault?

456
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,170
我这么跟你吵
I am lashing out at you

457
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,990
是因为我已经不止一次
because this is not the first time

458
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,700
被人这么指责了
I've been accused of this.

459
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,110
很抱歉我之前一直都没说过  歌洛莉亚
I am sorry I haven't said it before, Gloria.

460
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,100
我爱你
I love you.

461
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,240
我也爱你
I love you.

462
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,700
好了
Okay.

463
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,950
我的天  你说得对  的确很老套
My God, you're right. It is trite.

464
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,640
-你可以的  萨姆  -加油
- You got this, Sam! - Come on.

465
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,500
加油
Come on!

466
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,980
而你  要是再扔一个洗沟球
You on the other hand -- you throw one more gutter ball,

467
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,270
我就会诬陷你杀了人
And I will literally frame you for murder.

468
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,240
别有压力
No pressure.

469
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,830
那是怎么回事
I wonder what that's about.

470
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,160
你俩看上去很亲密嘛
You two seem awfully chummy.

471
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,320
如果你说的"亲密"指的是
Well, if by "chummy," you mean,

472
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,340
"处于一段来电的激情恋爱关系"
"In the throes of an electric sexual relationship,"

473
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,230
对  我们以你的保龄球发誓我们亲密得很
then, yes, you bet your bowling balls we're chummy.

474
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,910
我的天
Oh, my gosh.

475
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,370
这就说得通了
I just put it all together.

476
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,040
你俩都是菲茨宝
You're both Fizbo.

477
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,240
我跟你们其中一个在一起
When I'm with one of you,

478
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,610
另一个就去穿小丑服  制造完美不在场证明  
The other's wearing the costume, creating the perfect alibi.

479
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,120
灵光一闪啊
Light-bulb moment!

480
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,150
又在说小丑的事了
This clown thing again.

481
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,440
塔克你听我说  如果我想报复你
Look, Tucker, if I wanted to get back at you

482
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,250
报复一些比如像是
for, oh, I don't know, say something like

483
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,230
撮合我跟你直男岳父之类的事
setting me up with your straight father-in-law,

484
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,110
我绝对不会用
I certainly wouldn't do it

485
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,870
-偷走你傻逼宝服的手段  -是菲茨宝
- by stealing your stupid bozo suit. - It's Fizbo.

486
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,400
亲爱的  你人品最高尚了
Way to take the high road, sweetie.

487
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,690
首先  我会侵入你电邮
First, I'd hack your e-mails,

488
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,970
然后我会创几个社交网站小号
then I'd create several fake social-media accounts,

489
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,350
用来散播全方位抹黑  泼你脏水的谣言
which I would use to mount the multi-pronged smear campaign

490
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,430
让你与所有你爱的人的关系四分五裂
to drive a wedge between you and everything you love.

491
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,970
这话或许有点吓到人啊
That's maybe a bit of a red flag.

492
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,610
接着我会用你名义办几张信用卡
And then I'd get several credit cards in your name

493
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,010
并着手进行一场大规模身份盗窃计划
and then embark on a massive identity-theft scheme

494
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,380
把你搞到破产
that would leave you bankrupt

495
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,080
如果老天开眼  甚至还让你被刑事起诉
and, with any luck at all, facing criminal charges.

496
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:51,870
这才是我的报复方式
That's what I'd do.

497
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,080
好啦  她就是个小调皮蛋
Okay. She's a bit of a handful, huh?

498
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,650
我刚在想  或许我们这周末
You know, I was thinking, maybe we should take a beat

499
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,730
去见你父母的事可以再缓缓
on meeting your parents this weekend.

500
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,980
你怎么看  好啦
What do you say? All right.

501
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,600
什么
What?

502
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,500
高  太高招了
Bravo! Bravo.

503
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,180
如果你觉得你这段浮夸的报仇独白
If you think your little over-the-top revenge monologue

504
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,240
能够令我转移怀疑对象
is gonna throw me off your scent,

505
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,880
那你就大错特错了
then you are sorely mistaken.

506
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,450
打开你的包
Now open your bag.

507
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,330
什么
What?

508
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,820
你们所有人  打开你们的包
All of you, open your bags!

509
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,360
你们不用...  小卡  你快停下
You don't have... Cam, you got to stop.

510
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,530
快打开
Open them!

511
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,860
你有妄想症  你在发神经
You're paranoid. You are paranoid.

512
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,270
没有人穿着你...
No one is dressing up...

513
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,490
靠  最恨你对我错的时候了
Oh, damn it, I hate it when you're right.

514
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,990
什么  他在那里
What -- Oh! There he is!

515
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,220
追  快把他拿下
Chase him! Get him!

516
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,350
站住  你个冒牌货
Stop! Imposter!

517
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,850
请关上门  女士  我们在追犯人
Close your door, ma'am! We're in pursuit!

518
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,180
-好啦  悠点  悠点  -谢谢
- Okay, okay, okay. - Thank you!

519
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,500
好啦
Okay.

520
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,490
我们追丢他了
We lost him.

521
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,570
等等  他落了面具
Wait. His mask.

522
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,060
闻起来有啤酒跟起司薯条味
It smells like beer and cheese fires.

523
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,960
-米奇尔  简直神探啊  -太好啦
- Oh, Mitchell, that's good investigative work. - Yes.

524
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,510
你把犯人缩小到
You've narrowed it down

525
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,690
保龄球馆里的所有人啦
to everyone in the bowling alley.

526
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,310
我只剩一张牌啦
Uno.

527
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,330
你在这里啊
There you are.

528
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,170
我们到处找你呢
We've been looking all over for you.

529
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,830
你们有来这里找过吗  派对举办处这里
Did you check in here, in the room where the party is?

530
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,850
别担心  我们没忘掉你
Don't worry. We didn't forget about you.

531
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,030
希望你们做的事
I hope it was worth it.

532
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,980
比我们错过的老船长餐厅更值得一去
We missed our reservation to Captain Scupper's.

533
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,360
别担心  菲尔  我们吃过了
Don't worry, Phil. We ate.

534
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,810
赌场经理送了免费鲜虾鸡尾酒
Pit boss sent some shrimp cocktails 

535
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,860
到我们的双骰赌桌
over to our craps table.

536
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,800
还有一些普通的真鸡尾酒  对吧
Along with some regular cocktails, am I right?

537
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,850
对啊
Yeah!

538
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,730
你  你得在场才知道笑点
You -- you had to be there.

539
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,090
我懂  你们吃了虾喝了酒
I get it. You had shrimp and drinks.

540
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,440
如果不会给你们造成麻烦
Now, if it's not too much trouble,

541
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,940
我们能继续走安排的行程了吗
maybe we could get back on schedule.

542
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,600
我们可不能错过萨达卡的暖场表演
We don't want to miss Sedaka's opening act --

543
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,740
矮人版小理查
Extremely little richard.

544
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,550
{\an8}小理查是出生于1932年的老牌男歌手

545
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,550
天啊  他可真是超矮
Good golly, is he small!

546
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,850
计划改变了  我把那些票
Change of plans -- I traded those tickets

547
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,900
换成了"亚瑟王的逼中剑"的票
for seats to "Sexcalibur."

548
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,040
-你干嘛了  -是色情版的"中世纪秀"
- You what? - It's a dirty "Medieval times."

549
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,320
你不是吧
Are you kidding me?

550
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,560
没关系的  菲尔
It's okay, Phil.

551
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,210
我等了79年看尼尔·萨达卡的表演
I waited 79 years to see Neil Sedaka.

552
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,040
我不介意再等79年
I can wait another 79.

553
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,890
不行  老爸  你又烂好人了
No, dad. You're being too nice.

554
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,880
这是你的单身汉派对  不是你的
This is your bachelor party, not yours!

555
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,370
今晚都让你给毁了
You're ruining this whole night.

556
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,230
你在计划的时候就毁了今晚
You ruined it when you planed it.

557
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,350
把你的脏手指给我拿开
And get that finger out of my face.

558
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,330
没有人可以抢走我爸的派对
Nobody hijacks my dad's party,

559
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,290
也没有人能控制我的手指放哪
and nobody tells me where to put my finger.

560
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,130
熊孩子来啦
Here we go.

561
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,580
我十岁的时候想要个弟弟
I wanted a brother when I was 10,

562
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,980
不是想要只有十岁的弟弟
not a 10-year-old brother!

563
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,180
你才是幼稚鬼
You're the baby!

564
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,370
你虽然比我大  可你才是幼稚的那个
You're older, but you're the baby.

565
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,660
你才比不上马蒂
You're no Marty!

566
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,340
虽然算不上打架  但还是需要拦一下吧
It's not much of a fight, but maybe we should --

567
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,300
我知道  我原以为会越打越精彩
I know. I thought it was gonna get good.

568
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,370
行了  住手  不许打了
All right, that's enough. Stop.

569
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,800
菲尔  你这种表现太荒谬了
Phil, you're being ridiculous.

570
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,680
雷  我不认识你  但你看起来就是一个蠢货
Ray, I don't know you, but you seem like a horse's ass.

571
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,550
住手 可以了 成熟一点
All right, now! Grow up!

572
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,180
稍微有点大人样儿
Start acting like gentlemen.

573
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,790
不知你们两个介不介意
Uh, would you two mind

574
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,820
先一步去走廊等一会
stepping out in the hall for a second?

575
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,550
我有几句话想跟菲尔谈一谈
I need to have a word with Phil.

576
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,220
行吧  但你尽量快一点
All right, but hurry up.

577
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,680
我们可不能错过第一个少妇开始脱衣
We don't want to miss the unlacing of the first wench.

578
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,350
你知道吧  我真的很感激
You know, I really appreciate

579
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,270
你为了我的单身派对准备的这一切
all you've done arranging my party,

580
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,330
但其实做什么活动我都会很高兴
But, you know, I'm happy doing whatever.

581
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,870
是不是有什么别的事让你不开心了
Is something else bothering you?

582
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,890
我也不清楚
I don't know.

583
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,350
只是太多事情在改变  爸
So much is changing, dad.

584
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,010
我可能是有点害怕这将会是一个时代的终结
I guess I'm kind of afraid that this is the end of an era.

585
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,290
现在我得适应要和洛林与那家伙分享你
Now I have to share you with Lorraine, with that.

586
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,980
你不会失去我的
You're not losing me.

587
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,620
而且事实上  你以后会更经常见到我了呢
As a matter of fact, you're gonna be seeing a lot more of me.

588
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,950
洛林和我其实也在商量这个想法
Lorraine and I have been kind of kicking around the idea

589
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,500
就是搬到加州来
of moving to California.

590
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,980
为了离我更近吗
To be closer to me?

591
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,960
是啊
Yes.

592
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,510
也为了离雷稍微远一点
And to be farther from Ray.

593
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,380
路易丝  我们刚刚又看到恶魔版菲茨宝了
Hey, Louise, we just saw evil Fizbo again.

594
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,510
是真的  我刚才亲眼看见  
It's true. I was there. 

595
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,520
但我们追到停车场就追丢了
We lost him in the parking lot.

596
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,580
是啊  我们检查了每一辆车
Yeah, we looked in every car.

597
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,410
天啊  路易丝  你肯定能做点什么的吧
Geez, Louise, there has to be something you can do.

598
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,250
好的  明早我立刻去查
Fine. First thing tomorrow, I'll look into it

599
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,500
但前提你专心打这场保龄球赛
if you can focus on bowling.

600
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,560
-我可以  -你在这里啊
- I can. - There you are.

601
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,430
我刚才到处找你  轮到你上场了
I've been looking all over for you. It's your turn.

602
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,420
对不起  我刚才去了厕所
Sorry. I was in the ladies room.

603
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,250
给我的小屁屁贴镇痛药布
I was putting icyhot on my hammies.

604
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,900
你手怎么了吗
D-did you do something to your hand?

605
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,590
我刚才玩空气曲棍球的时候弄伤了
I just hurt it playing air hockey.

606
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,470
他们几个月前就把空气曲棍球桌撤掉了
They got rid of the air hockey table months ago.

607
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,860
不是啦  我是指...
Uh -- nothing. I mean, I was --

608
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,810
等等  等一下  慢着听我说
Wait -- w-wait -- wait a minute.

609
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,890
你刚刚消失了
You go missing,

610
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,230
然后你说不清原由地伤到了你的手  而且
Then you mysteriously hurt your hand, and t--

611
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,670
好的很好  这个面具里留下的口红印
Okay, okay -- there is lipstick in this mask,

612
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,080
它  它和你啤酒杯上的口红印同色
and it is -- it is the same shade as the lipstick on your beer.

613
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,460
你居然是假菲茨宝吗
You're Fizbo?

614
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,160
你居然涂口红啊
You wear lipstick?

615
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,540
但你是跟我们一队的啊
But you're on our team.

616
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,720
你为什么要这样做啊
Why would you do this?

617
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,400
因为我快被你恶心死了
Because you bug me.

618
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,380
就因为这样吗
That's it?

619
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,590
队伍名也是你选  队伍服也是你设计
You picked the team name, you designed the shirts,

620
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,760
所有的荣誉都让你揽了
You take all the credit.

621
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,140
所有的事都是以你为中心
Everything's about you.

622
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,080
你扰乱他的思维  好让他害我们队输掉比赛
You messed with his head so he'd lose us the team championship.

623
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,620
然后自己当上队长之路就一片光明
Yeah, opening the door for -- for you to be captain.

624
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,030
本来就应该是我当队长
I should be captain.

625
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,050
把我的菲茨宝还给我
Give me my Fizbo.

626
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,120
然后你从我的面前消失
You get out of my face.

627
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,250
等一下  稍等我确认一下
Wait, wait, no. Hold on. Hold on.

628
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,880
我们还有任何希望赢这场比赛吗
Is there still a chance that we could win this?

629
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,590
除非我们能一球击倒57个球瓶
Not unless we can pick up 57 pins in one frame.

630
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,500
好的  你现在从他面前消失
Yeah. And you get out of his face.

631
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,920
-你好  您父亲胯下的作品  -叫"米奇尔"就行了
- Hello, fruit of your father's loins. "Mitchell"'s fine.

632
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,360
既然聊到了杰
You know, speaking of jay --

633
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,400
是你自己提起的
You brought him up.

634
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,490
好吧  你爸爸和我  曾来电过一会儿
Well, your father and I had a moment...

635
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,200
就在几年之前
Uh-huh. ...A couple of years ago

636
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,390
{\an8}第6季第20集

637
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,720
在他假装是基佬
when he was pretending to be gay

638
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,390
来参加我们的保龄球赛时那会儿
so that he could bowl in our league.

639
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,850
我知道他说了那全是演的
I know he said it was all an act,

640
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,690
但我从他身上所感受到的
but what I felt from him --

641
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,700
感觉实在太真实了
it was just so very real.

642
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,390
好了马丁  我也不想泼你冷水
Okay, Martin, I hate to break this to you,

643
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,010
但我的父亲很有可能是
but my dad is potentially

644
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,280
这个星球上最直的男人
the straightest man on the planet.

645
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,210
我知道  但尽管如此
Yeah, but notwithstanding,

646
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,500
你能不能考虑把他的电话号码留给我
do you think maybe you could give me his phone number?

647
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,060
和他之间我总感觉有故事还没有完结
It's just always felt like unfinished business to me.

648
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,830
我绝不会把他的电话号码给你的
I am not giving you his phone number.

649
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,640
我愿意给你我的奖杯
I'll give you my trophy.

650
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,020
你记一下是 310...
It's 310...
