  have to explain myself to you.

          you're angry with her.

908
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:21,571
Because I just                  
sacrificed my daughter.         

909
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,440
Because I just sentenced        
my daughter to death

Send me back to Earth-2.

Think about it.

00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,918
Zoom wants you to get faster.   

916

He wants you to have            
more Speed Force in you,        

917
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,356
for when he finally takes it,   
send me back,

Shut down all the breaches.     

920
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:46,529
Close them all                  

921
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:49,299
and Zoom will never             
be able to crossover,
