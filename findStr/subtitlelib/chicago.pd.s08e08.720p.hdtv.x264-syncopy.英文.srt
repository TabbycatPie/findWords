9
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,090
So this really something you're doing

10
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,720
- with every officer from CPD? - Yes, sir.

11
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,870
Hey, you don't have to call me sir.

12
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,110
It's pretty formal for somebody

13
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,340
who's gonna ask me my deepest, darkest secrets.

14
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,980
It won't be that, I promise.

15
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,480
I'm simply asking questions

16
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,640
designed to forecast future problems.

17
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,840
To predict the future?

18
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,160
Oh, that'd be nice, wouldn't it?

19
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,030
But no.

20
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,150
This is just another supplement to Early Intervention Strategy.

21
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,860
Right, to predict if I'm gonna do something stupid

22
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,330
on the job in the future.

23
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,670
It's purely supportive, not punitive.

24
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,200
What if I answer a question wrong?

25
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,290
There is no wrong.

26
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,480
Any answer would just help us understand you.

27
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,770
- Who you are. - Well, I get that.

28
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,090
I've been to therapy before, so lay it on me.

29
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,380
So how do you like your coffee?

30
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,280
Black.

31
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,650
How do you like yours?

32
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,660
I don't drink coffee.

33
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,120
And have you always taken it that way?

34
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,370
Yes, one cream, one sugar, every morning.

35
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,730
Does that say something about me?

36
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,620
Would you consider yourself a creature of habit?

37
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,580
Uh, no, no, I drink all the drinks.

38
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,750
Have you ever used a racial slur?

39
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,980
That's a hell of a segue. No, no I have not.

40
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,720
Have you ever heard a family member use a racial slur?

41
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,160
I don't know. Maybe.

42
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,050
Yeah.

43
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,550
Would you say you have a good relationship

44
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,710
- with your family? - I'd say it's fine.

45
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,820
Do you consider the police force your family?

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,360
My unit.

47
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,170
And the rest of the police force?

48
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,300
No, coworkers.

49
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,820
Have you ever felt

50
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,330
what you would categorize as anger issues?

51
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,170
Nope.

52
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,590
And what about trauma?

53
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,750
Yes.

54
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,200
Have you experienced post-traumatic stress?

55
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,500
Yes.

56
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,520
Have you ever made a mistake on the job?

57
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,390
Have you ever had to fire your weapon?

58
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,100
Have you ever killed someone?

59
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,270
Have you ever felt fear on the job?

60
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,410
Do you believe you are the wrong fit for this job?

61
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,750
Are you proud to be an officer

62
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,570
of the Chicago Police Department?

63
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,830
Do you believe you're capable, worthy, right?

64
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,070
What the actual hell do they think

65
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,410
they're gonna get out of all of that?

66
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,770
They should check my police record

67
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,520
if they wanna know if I'm a good or a bad cop.

68
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,810
Am I right? Am I?

69
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,900
Nah, nah, they don't wanna know who you are now.

70
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,620
They wanna know who you gonna be then.

71
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,510
One hour with them, and you're a psychic too?

72
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,450
Maybe I got the future in me,

73
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,970
but if asking us questions is gonna help us find prejudice,

74
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,750
prevent problems, and progress policing,

75
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,080
then I'll sit for it all damn day.

76
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,220
I get the intention.

77
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,870
It's just, I don't know, seems a little overzealous, right?

78
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,110
I'm just saying, you don't punish the many

79
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,520
to get to the few, you know?

80
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,570
Grill good cops looking for cracks that ain't there.

81
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,810
I just wanna know what my coffee order

82
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,220
- has to do with anything. - Hey, guys.

83
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,030
What's going on? We got a case?

84
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,120
An officer-involved shooting.

85
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,820
- A bad one. - No.

86
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,730
What happened?

87
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,290
A buddy of mine in patrol

88
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,980
sent over this civilian witness video.

89
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,590
Somebody caught it on a cell phone.

90
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,420
I said get your hands all the way up

91
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,320
and turn around.

92
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,130
Stop pointing your gun at me!

93
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,650
Hands up! Turn around!

94
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,390
Your gun is pointed at me, and I did nothing wrong.

95
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,430
So no.

96
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,530
Then this is the last time. Okay?

97
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,140
You're gonna get your hands away from your weapon,

98
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,060
and you're gonna turn around.

99
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,260
Hey, hey, Wheelan, let's just relax, all right?

100
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,090
I'm not moving. I know my rights.

101
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,900
Call your supervisor.

102
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,450
Hey, hands away from your weapon, up!

103
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,610
Mine aren't nowhere near my weapon!

104
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,540
- Get them up! - Let's just calm down.

105
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,090
- Turn around! - I ain't gonna move.

106
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,760
- I said turn around! - Wheelan!

107
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,890
- Now! - Wheelan!

108
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,790
Now!

109
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,660
Oh, my God!

110
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,740
No!

111
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,990
The kid die?

112
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,350
On the pavement.

113
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,290
Who was he?

114
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,830
His name is Jeff Duncan. Zero priors.

115
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,370
Had a legal gun in his waistband.

116
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,070
Pulled over for going seven over the speed limit.

117
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,110
Graduate of Whitney Young.

118
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,160
Student at University of Chicago.

119
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,630
And the officers?

120
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,960
The FTO who fired the shot, Dave Wheelan.

121
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,230
PPO a month out of the academy is named Andre Cooper.

122
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,230
Cooper's talking?

123
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,640
Oh yeah, to IRT and COPA,

124
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,840
and his statement never changed.

125
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,130
Jeff never went for his weapon.

126
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,990
There was zero justification to use deadly force.

127
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,730
I also have three witnesses

128
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,510
and two POD cameras.

129
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,790
IAD is on their way to Officer Wheelan's house now,

130
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,050
but I would like two undercovers

131
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,350
to make the transport.

132
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,100
That's... That's not what my unit does.

133
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,340
I mean I think you'd be hard pressed

134
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,890
to find any Chicago police officer

135
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,350
- who wants to step in this. - I know.

136
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,000
I know history tells us that this

137
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
is not something to step in,

138
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,670
which is why I'm asking a unit I trust,

139
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,120
and I hope trusts me.

140
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,750
I've watched this footage three dozen times, Hank,

141
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,240
as has the SA.

142
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,650
And it's as clear as this moment ever comes,

143
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,010
it was a bad shoot.

144
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,880
Can you spare two officers, Sergeant Voight?

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
The video's not yet viral,

146
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,230
but we will be putting every officer on immediate 12s.

147
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,550
We expect mass protests and violence,

148
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,090
so we will move fast.

149
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,210
Officer Atwater, Officer Ruzek,

150
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,190
I want you to go to Officer Wheelan's home

151
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,020
and arrest him for murder.

153
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,840
Officer Dave Wheelan, on the job 30 years,

154
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,510
16 department commendations, only one complaint a year.

155
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,920
You can read about him all you want, but listen to me:

156
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,550
you're both nothing more than an Uber, okay?

157
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,290
Read him his rights, arrest him,

158
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,170
drive him, drop him off at south detention.

159
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,020
You do nothing, you say nothing.

160
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,730
Do not get involved.

161
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,750
Not one word that can get you in trouble

162
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,660
if you have to testify,

163
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,970
- you understand me? - Yeah.

164
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,990
All right, car's been cleared.

165
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,020
It's unmarked.

166
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,300
Should be another unit doing this.

167
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,320
I feel like any good cop

168
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,630
should be able to arrest a cop like this.

169
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,980
I mean this file's real sparse. This can't be the whole of it.

170
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,080
It makes him look like a good cop

171
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,200
who murdered a kid at a routine traffic stop.

172
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,620
Yeah, routine all right.

173
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,130
He didn't have guns in the house.

174
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,890
He's got a wife and kids. They're gonna be all emotional.

175
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,330
- Hey, Linette. - Hi, guys.

176
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,620
- Imagine Jeff Duncan's family. - I have.

177
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,070
Only we're not going to Jeff Duncan's house

178
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,140
- to arrest nobody. - Thank you, Linette.

179
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,310
Yeah. You're welcome.

180
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,100
Look, brother, I know that this is a situation

181
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,190
that can spin us in a lot of different ways.

182
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,890
Most of those ways are above our pay grade.

183
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,310
So like Voight said, this got nothing to do with us.

184
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,540
Let's just go arrest this guy like the criminal he is,

185
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,310
nice and easy, get back to doing our real jobs, yeah?

186
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,180
Copy that.

187
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,920
Murderer!

188
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,160
Come on.

189
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,790
Well, the arrest clearly leaked.

190
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,360
Knew we were coming.

191
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,930
My partner's in there. I just wanna talk.

192
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,140
Is that Wheelan's trainee?

193
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,760
Hey, man. You're not gonna touch me,

194
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,780
and you're not gonna tell me to walk away, all right?

195
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,950
I have every right to be here.

196
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,730
He should be on mandatory leave.

197
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,510
Come on, Kev. Let's go.

198
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,490
It's all right. Hey, we all right?

199
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,390
Hey, I just need to know why he shot him.

200
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,880
Can we have a minute?

201
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,540
Come on, man. Cooper, right?

202
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,950
- Yeah. - Atwater, Ruzek.

203
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,060
You ain't been in there, have you?

204
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,540
No, I haven't. I get that I shouldn't.

205
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,350
You should not.

206
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,620
Hey, yeah, man, I was right there.

207
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,080
I was right there next to him.

208
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,200
I rode with that dude a month.

209
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,490
Brother, I just need to know why.

210
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,260
You know why.

211
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,700
And you know you gotta go home. Get out of here, man.

212
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,480
It's okay, we got it.

213
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,770
Come on. We'll be back in a few.

214
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,970
Don't take too long.

215
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,270
Mrs. Wheelan, I'm Officer Ruzek.

216
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,190
This is Officer Atwater.

217
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,540
Thank God. Come in.

218
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,670
Thank you.

219
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,060
Our phones have been ringing nonstop.

221
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,350
Ma'am.

222
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,520
Where's your husband?

223
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,650
He's upstairs with the kids. They're scared.

224
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,850
What is this? You're with the FOP, right?

225
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,270
I assume you're here to help my husband.

226
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,290
Uh, no.

227
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,680
Annie, I'm guessing they're here to arrest me.

228
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,110
- No. - David Wheelan, you're under arrest.

229
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,890
- Can you step down please? - No.

230
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,260
Dad, what's going on?

231
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,190
Kay, look, I only got one ask.

232
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,260
Okay, spare my kids, huh? Cuff me outside.

233
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,070
Yeah, we can do that.

234
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,970
Protocol is that we cuff you inside.

235
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,500
- Turn around. - Kevin...

236
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,760
Kevin, uh... kids around.

237
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,220
Do you have any weapons on you?

238
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,560
- No. - Is this his jacket?

239
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,540
Hey, Katie, sweetheart, it's gonna be fine.

240
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,080
Dave Wheelan, you're under arrest

241
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,090
- for the murder of Jeff Duncan. - All right?

242
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,910
Kay, take your sister upstairs.

243
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,210
- Dave. - Zach, take her upstairs.

244
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,530
- What am I supposed to do? - Go to your room, Katie.

245
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,140
It'll be fine, honey.

246
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,110
You have a right to an attorney.

247
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,900
If you do not have an attorney, one will be...

248
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,710
I did nothing. You know what, I did nothing.

249
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,620
You're gonna get a call soon. I already called an attorney.

250
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,860
- I did nothing wrong! - Stop talking.

251
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,430
My life was in danger! I did nothing wrong!

252
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,770
I did my job, and I'd do it again!

253
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,350
- Stop talking! - I'm innocent!

254
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,330
Back up!

255
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,580
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

256
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,180
Back up! Get away from the car!

257
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,170
Please step away from the vehicle, ma'am.

258
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,990
Stand back. Hey, hey, back up.

259
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,360
Easy, Ruz, easy, Ruz, easy.

260
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,570
What the hell was that?

261
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,040
The truth. Because they need to hear it.

262
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,680
Adam, Kev?

263
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,350
Yeah, Hailey, we made the arrest.

264
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,060
- We're in transit. - We got a problem.

265
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,350
There's a video we didn't know about.

266
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,840
Jeff Duncan had an app on his phone

267
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,110
that recorded the traffic stop

268
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,900
and sent the full video to all of his emergency contacts.

269
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,750
How many people saw the video?

270
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,590
It's gone viral.

271
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,660
We've got unruly crowds at headquarters, City Hall,

272
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,370
the jails, and south detention.

273
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,900
We got death threats against Wheelan.

274
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,030
Okay, Hailey, what are you telling us here?

275
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,290
I'm saying you can't bring him in yet.

276
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,770
Not until we clear this out. Sorry.

278
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,240
There's a safe house about ten minutes from you.

279
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,670
I'm gonna send you everything right now.

280
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,170
Just stay there, and we'll be quick, all right?

281
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,330
Okay. Copy that.

282
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,230
Hey, come on with these cuffs, huh?

283
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,890
They're cutting off my circulation.

284
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,240
- I can't feel my shoulders. - Here.

285
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,430
Thanks.

286
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,510
Put your jacket on.

287
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,890
Should be another unit doing this, man.

288
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,270
This ain't too bad, huh?

289
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,910
Usually it's just a crappy motel room somewhere.

290
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,940
Put your hands out.

291
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,570
Oh, you gotta be kidding me. It's just us three here now.

292
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,670
Yeah, what'd you think was happening here?

293
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,780
Put your hands out.

294
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,580
There. Sit. We shouldn't be here long.

295
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,430
Yeah.

296
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,170
We shouldn't have to be here at all.

297
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,210
I'm here over a video showing me doing my job.

298
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:28,940
Come on, man.

299
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,910
We're here because a mob of people want your head.

300
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,630
So cut out all the commentary, all right?

301
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,260
I get what you think you're seeing when you look at me.

302
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,670
Some racist white cop prick, right?

303
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,260
But the video speaks for itself.

304
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,290
It sure does.

305
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,540
You know, anything you say to us

306
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,530
can be used against you,

307
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,820
so how about we just all stay quiet?

308
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,040
No. Watch the video.

309
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,340
You didn't see the full thing.

310
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,460
So go ahead and watch all of it.

311
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,070
I know you want to. So watch it.

312
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,230
Yeah.

313
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,630
All right.

314
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,120
License, registration, and proof of insurance?

315
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,530
Why am I being pulled over?

316
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,010
Driving above the posted speed limit, sir.

317
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,730
Come on, I wasn't going that fast.

318
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,490
This is just a routine traffic stop, sir.

319
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,660
Just cover the passenger side.

320
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,880
Last time.

321
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,670
License and proof of insurance.

322
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,110
Officer, I wasn't speeding. I don't know what this is--

323
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,840
Ah, ah, ah. Hey, watch the tone

324
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,670
and calm down so I can do my job.

325
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,790
That's what this is.

326
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,420
Is harassing people your job?

327
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,120
'Cause that's what this feels like.

328
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,690
And for the record, because I am recording this,

329
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,490
I am legally carrying a firearm in my waistband.

330
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,500
I have a concealed carry permit in my wallet.

331
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,320
Okay, I'm gonna need for you

332
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,060
to step out of the vehicle now.

333
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,330
What? Why?

334
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,500
Am I being arrested?

335
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,470
I just gave an order. Step out.

336
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,880
Call your supervisor. I'm not moving.

337
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,450
Why the hell is a gun pointed at me?

338
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,640
Step out of the vehicle.

339
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,710
Wheelan, sir, let's just calm down.

340
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,410
Yeah, Wheelan. Calm down.

341
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,270
Step out of the damn vehicle.

342
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,830
- Search the car. - You need a warrant for that!

343
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,220
Sir, that's an intrusive search.

344
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,880
Kid, do it or find a new job, now!

345
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,540
Hands up! Turn around!

346
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,240
Your gun is pointed at me, and I did nothing wrong.

347
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,950
- So no. - Last time.

348
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,250
Get your hands up, away from the weapon,

349
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:24,860
and turn around.

350
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,380
Hey, hey, Wheelan. Let's just relax, man.

351
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,350
I'm not moving. I know my rights.

352
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,580
Call your supervisor.

353
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,220
Turn around. Hands away from the weapon!

354
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,030
My hands are nowhere near my weapon!

355
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,920
- Let's just calm down. - Turn around!

356
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,420
I ain't gonna move so you can shoot me.

357
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,260
Now!

358
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,740
Let's just calm down. Wheelan--

359
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,570
Now.

360
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,210
You see now?

361
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,640
He wouldn't comply.

362
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,640
He--he was hostile,

363
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,850
he was armed, and he moved.

364
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,040
I feared for my life, and I acted.

365
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,730
You mean to tell me all--

366
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,600
Hailey didn't say we were getting backup, did she?

367
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,240
Get down!

368
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,520
We got two shooters!

369
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,980
Get your head down. Follow me.

370
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,820
Keep your head down. Head down, come on.

371
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Get in the truck.

372
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,400
- Kev got me, you got me? - I got it, I got it, I got it.

373
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,140
- They're in the house, Ruz.. - Get in the truck, dude.

374
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,070
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

375
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,150
- You got it? - Yeah.

376
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,510
- Son of a bitch. - Damn.

377
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,780
10-1, 10-1! Shots fired at the police.

378
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,840
Keep your head down.

379
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,820
We got another shooter!

380
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,600
Are we clear? Tell me we're clear.

381
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,980
Uh, yeah. No tail, no follow.

382
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,450
They're trying to kill me!

383
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,960
I shot one of them. There's at least two shooters.

384
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,790
Take these cuffs off. Take them off.

385
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,540
- I'm a cop, same as you! - Shut up!

386
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,230
- God. - Tell me you got your ears on!

387
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
- Sarge, our guys got ambushed. - What?

388
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:24,760
I'm here.

389
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,930
Are you okay? I heard the whole thing over the radio.

390
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,750
Yeah, somebody hit the safehouse.

391
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,680
What the hell does he mean, hit?

392
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,410
- Are you all right? - Uh, we're fine.

393
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,360
We hit one of the shooters, maybe two.

394
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,770
Both were masked.

395
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,580
I mean, the place was clearly compromised.

396
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,760
They were there to kill Wheelan.

397
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,790
Adam, are you still at the house?

398
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,040
No, no, no, we're driving.

399
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,300
Patrol said they were a minute out,

400
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,980
but driving feels safer right now.

401
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,140
Okay, we are heading to the safe house now, see what we can learn.

402
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,680
Find a location off road, hang tight until we get you an escort,

403
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,720
and use only your DCs to communicate.

404
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,850
All right, copy that.

405
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,380
- Yo, Ruz. Garage. - Yeah.

406
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,960
I wasn't hit. Take the cuffs off.

407
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,180
- Turn around. - I'm not hit.

408
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,260
But you know you can't take me to another safehouse

409
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,330
'cause if they found us at the first one,

410
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,380
they're gonna find us at the next one.

411
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,070
They're hunting me!

412
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,310
What the hell do we do now?

413
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,060
There's something very wrong here.

414
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,160
Those shooters just made a safehouse.

415
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,510
I know. What we gotta do is ask ourselves this question:

416
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,780
was it an inside job?

417
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,990
Only people that know about the safehouse is CPD.

418
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,220
Not to mention, they just beat patrol by two minutes.

419
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,390
All right.

420
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,930
I think the safest thing is we keep this between us,

421
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,710
we take him off book,

422
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,330
we take him somewhere nobody knows about,

423
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,190
till we can figure out what the hell's going on,

424
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,540
who the hell's hunting him.

425
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,160
Take him off book.

426
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,150
Take him off book.

427
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,510
Boss, we got a plan. Disregard that escort.

428
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,540
Copy that.

429
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,360
What are we looking at?

430
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,490
Looks like Atwater caught him center mass.

431
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,880
- We got a name? - No, not yet.

432
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,740
They just printed him, but I'm thinking we're gonna get a pop.

433
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,870
He's got prison tats.

434
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,040
Let me show you this.

435
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,360
There's .32 caliber shell casings here.

436
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,380
Got 9 mil casings all the way over here.

437
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,880
And then there's blood going down the gangway.

438
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,930
So the second shooter, he's in the wind, but he's injured.

439
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,260
So they both had street sweepers.

440
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,770
Oh, yeah, they were coordinated,

441
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,430
but they didn't care about crossfire. This is a do or die crew.

442
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,770
- We're probably not looking at teenage foot soldiers. - No.

443
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,420
And when did Miller get here?

444
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,920
She got here before us.

445
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,190
Hey, can I show you something?

446
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,600
Ma'am.

447
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,010
Guys, give us the room.

448
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,050
- You heard from your guys? - I have.

449
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,630
- Well, they all right? - No injuries.

450
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,160
Where are they?

451
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,180
I don't know.

452
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,520
They're transporting Wheelan off book.

453
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,090
They turned their cells off.

454
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,330
And they made that call with you?

455
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,270
They did. Look.

456
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,210
My men are not gonna bring Wheelan in

457
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,340
if there is any chance that he or any civilian

458
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,470
could take a bullet while en route, okay?

459
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,960
You need to try and give me an order

460
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,800
'cause of the political dirt we just stepped in, go ahead.

461
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,510
I'm here because I had you step in the dirt with me.

462
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,500
I'm not giving you any orders.

463
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,080
Whatever your call is, that's the call.

464
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,430
In the meantime,

465
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,370
I got a team digging into a potential leak at CPD.

466
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,930
You trusted me, Hank.

467
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,860
I trust you.

468
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,700
Okay, you need to take my cuffs off now.

469
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,430
Nobody's taking them off. Stop asking.

470
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,140
I'm not gonna be a defenseless animal.

471
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,850
- Sit down. - I'm not the criminal here.

472
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,710
No? Who is?

473
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,750
The 19-year-old Black kid you shot down?

474
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,610
I defended myself.

475
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,030
From a college student?

476
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,540
I had the right to defend my life.

477
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,490
From what?

478
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,080
Kev. Don't.

479
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,680
No. From what?

480
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,420
I just watched the video. You told me to.

481
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,440
You murdered a kid,

482
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,000
and you're gonna stand here in front of me and defend yourself?

483
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,370
- Just let it go. - Let it go?

484
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,760
He's standing in front of you too.

485
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,340
All I'm saying is, we might be here a while.

486
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,210
None of this is helping. That's all I'm saying.

487
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,140
Let it go. He's not worth it.

488
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,450
Uncuff me. You know I'm right.

489
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,610
I wanna make something really clear to you, man.

490
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,280
The only reason we brought you here

491
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,960
was to keep you from being assassinated.

492
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,220
It doesn't mean either of us think that you're innocent.

493
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,070
Now sit down.

494
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,620
Now.

495
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,230
Ruzek and Atwater can't move

496
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,700
until we determine that leak wasn't inside,

497
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,640
and we got that second shooter in custody.

498
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,100
So who the hell is going after Officer Dave Wheelan?

499
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Hey, mobile techs just sent over the fingerprint card

500
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,730
on our dead shooter. Ray Macks, 25.

501
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,910
Gangs has him hooked up with the Rollin' Reapers.

502
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,790
His boss, T-J Jones,

503
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,510
just so happens to be the half-brother of Jeff Duncan.

504
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,360
T-J runs a crew of hired guns.

505
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,720
They think of themselves as the "police of gangland."

506
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,240
So T-J's half-brother gets killed by a police officer,

507
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,350
and he sends two of his guys to kill that police officer.

508
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,480
He's keeping order on the street.

509
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,530
We got anything on T-J?

510
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,750
No, no open warrants, no longer on probation,

511
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,600
I seriously doubt he's carrying.

512
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,070
I mean, Gangs has been on it for a while,

513
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,950
but they have nothing to arrest him on.

514
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,990
Yeah, well, he knows our second shooter,

515
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,140
so we're gonna make him talk to us anyway.

516
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,540
Jay, you and me. Grab that file.

517
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,300
Okay.

518
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,750
We're just here to talk to T-J.

519
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,500
Yo.

520
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,410
TJ
T-j.

521
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,230
You're expecting us, huh?

522
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,660
My brother was murdered by your people.

523
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,890
I'd hope you'd come for that,

524
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,030
if that is why you came.

525
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,420
We want you to come in and talk to us.

526
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,920
I don't talk to police without a witness.

527
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,750
Listen, talking out here with all this...

528
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,090
It's just not gonna work for me.

529
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,740
Then I guess we won't talk.

530
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,020
You don't have anything to arrest me on.

531
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,250
No, I don't.

532
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,030
Is this your friend, Tom? You Tom Greggin', right?

533
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,230
AKA Gregs.

534
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,090
You're two months into probation.

535
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,870
That's Walter Culmin. Six months.

536
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,140
Who we got out here? That's Jimmy Markey.

537
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,660
Russell Wall, you got your two kids living with you?

538
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,820
And I know this is Joe Hart, who's got his mom living on his dime.

539
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,870
I could keep going,

540
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,320
but it's pretty clear you're all fraternizing with felons.

541
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,090
We've got parole officers on their way unless we call them off.

542
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,890
What do you say you come in and talk,

543
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,570
so we don't have to keep ruining everyone's day?

544
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,520
Am I under arrest?

545
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,180
No, sir.

546
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,110
- Call my lawyer anyway. - Yeah, got you.

547
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,810
Keep filming.

548
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,220
You know who he is?

549
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,770
Nope.

550
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,880
Ray and a second man

551
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,280
tried to kill a prisoner and two cops.

552
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,830
Ray is dead now,

553
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,880
and the second guy got away.

554
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,210
We need to find them.

555
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,360
Do you know who he is?

556
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,020
No.

557
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,560
He doesn't work for you?

558
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,610
You didn't order him and Ray to kill Wheelan?

559
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,700
No.

560
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,680
Where were you two hours ago?

561
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,900
Live on the Gram with my girl,

562
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,450
but you know that already.

563
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,340
I willingly gave you my phone. You asked.

564
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,560
I imagine that call with your lady friend must've been rough.

565
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,030
I mean, losing your half-brother like that,

566
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,300
another Black man gone, shot by a cop.

567
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,470
I get it.

568
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,920
I do.

569
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,780
T-J, that cop was being brought in on murder charges.

570
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,750
You understand? Murder.

571
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,610
CPD is doing this one right.

572
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,890
One thing I would appreciate

573
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,900
is if you wouldn't call Jeff my half-brother.

574
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,320
He was my brother.

575
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,310
My blood.

576
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,250
You guys were close. We understand that.

577
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,480
But shooting at the cops, T-J?

578
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,650
Not the right move.

579
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,070
To get justice, even us cops have to trust the system.

580
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,340
It's what we got.

581
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,640
It's what you got.

582
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,020
It's your system.

583
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,700
Our system doesn't protect your neighborhood.

584
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,940
So you do, right?

585
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,250
I didn't say that.

586
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,130
But trust the system?

587
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,580
You willing to bet half a billion on that

588
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,870
instead of paying police misconduct bills?

589
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,010
I think if you both looked at yourself,

590
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,010
we'd know the same thing.

591
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,400
Y'all ain't in my neighborhood camped out to protect us.

592
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,880
Y'all only there to make sure

593
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,040
we don't leak out into the rest of the city.

594
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,250
But I shot no one. I never shot anyone.

595
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,190
I don't even own a gun.

596
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,280
You have nothing on me.

597
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,950
So I'd like to go now.

598
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,060
His alibi's rock solid.

599
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,370
He's definitely not our second shooter.

600
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,780
Hey, did his lawyer show yet?

601
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,130
Yeah, he's already threatening to sue.

602
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,800
He says we brought T-J in unlawfully,

603
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,970
and he wants a release right away.

604
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,290
What about T-J's phone?

605
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,890
We're good there. We downloaded everything.

606
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,490
It's mostly burner phone contacts.

607
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,480
The guy's really smart, but our OCD techs are on it.

608
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,670
Okay, okay.

609
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,490
So we'll release him.

610
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,500
Just get a tracker on his car and put a tac team on it too.

611
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,860
We're gonna take everything we got

612
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,830
and put it up against everything in T-J's phone.

613
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,790
Believe me, that second shooter

614
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,570
is gonna be buried in there somewhere.

615
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,910
Find him.

616
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,800
All right, Ray Macks.

617
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,810
- He's one of the shooters. You recognize him? - No.

618
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,670
- All right, T-J Jones. - Nope.

619
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,340
You've been in Englewood 30 years,

620
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,230
and you're going to tell me you've never seen those faces?

621
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,830
Sure, I've seen those faces a bunch of times.

622
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,380
Okay, that's a start.

623
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,130
You tell us who's in their crew.

624
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,460
No, I mean I've seen those faces.

625
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,410
The "I hate cops" faces.

626
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,560
Do you have any personal beefs in Englewood?

627
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,680
Come on, man. Help us out here.

628
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,340
Yeah, yeah, we all do.

629
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,170
Where I work, it's us versus them.

630
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,940
We show up, they see an occupying force.

631
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,020
Nah, not all of us.

632
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,650
Oh, come on, man.

633
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,110
Sure, every time we show up,

634
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,500
we starting a bad relationship.

635
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,550
You know why?

636
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,490
We're the city's secret thoughts and fears

637
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,000
dressed in blue with badges and guns.

638
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,370
Yeah, my dad used to say the same stupid thing.

639
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,360
We cannot leave here until we get this other shooter in custody.

640
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,270
- I know that. - Then help us.

641
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,880
I am helping you out, but I don't have any names, all right?

642
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,070
They're just shooting at me

643
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,540
because I was doing my job, you got that?

644
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,120
- Your job, huh? - That's right.

645
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,270
- Yeah? - Yes.

646
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,590
Explain your job to me.

647
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,860
- Hey, I didn't wanna die. - There's no talking.

648
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,420
- So I did-- - Shut up!

649
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,210
Listen up.

650
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,870
Miller's office just confirmed the leak was not from inside CPD,

651
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,700
so where are we at with that second shooter?

652
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,500
We're close.

653
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,730
OCD tech pulled all the numbers from T-J's phone.

654
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,530
Only 11 of those were also on the dead shooter's phone.

655
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,520
Five of those, including the dead shooter's,

656
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,050
were purchased and activated together three months ago.

657
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,700
- We're guessing T-J got them first. - Okay, I got it.

658
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,280
Only one number pinged to every tower

659
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,140
alongside the dead shooter's phone.

660
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,320
This has gotta be our guy right here.

661
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,770
- Okay, find out where that phone is now. - Yup.

662
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,240
Hey, guys. I just got off with OCD tech.

663
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,470
And they finally got something from POD footage.

664
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,550
A silver SUV was caught on eight cameras.

665
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,040
It was parked a block away from Dave Wheelan's house.

666
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,960
Then they caught it at two stoplights

667
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,200
behind Atwater and Ruzek,

668
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,540
and then it's right out front of our safehouse.

669
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,800
- Okay, it was a physical follow. - Yeah.

670
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,360
The car is registered to an Antoinette Clark.

671
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,810
She's 22, lives in Englewood.

672
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,290
Halstead, give me that address.

673
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,060
It's 63rd and Marquette.

674
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,300
That's where our second shooter's phone is sitting right now.

675
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,600
- Get that guy in custody now. - Let's go.

676
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,360
Chicago PD. Open up.

677
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,220
- Antoinette Clark? - No one called the police.

678
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,360
Is he in there? Did he hurt you?

679
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,240
No one hurt me. You don't have a warrant.

680
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,640
I don't have to let you in. Nobody even called you.

681
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,060
Antoinette, we know he's hurt.

682
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,250
We can help.

683
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,160
He's still bleeding, isn't he?

684
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,030
He was shot hours ago.

685
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,530
If he's still bleeding, then he's dying.

686
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,160
You know that.

687
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,800
I got her.

688
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,820
Gun.

689
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,370
5021 George, I need an ambo to 6850 Marquette.

690
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,640
GSW victim.

691
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Copy that, 5021 George. Ambo on the way.

692
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,400
Look, I'm just saying, okay?

693
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,680
Three decades I protected those people,

694
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,950
and now I'm getting judged for five minutes on a video

695
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,840
showing me being police.

696
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,530
- You hear this dude? - I'm trying not to.

697
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,250
...but this guy wasn't that!

698
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,920
All right? He was not compliant from the start!

699
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,900
Please, I just-- Please.

700
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,630
Let's just ignore him. Stay calm.

701
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,690
Why?

702
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,620
Why am I keeping calm? Why are you so calm?

703
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,120
How can you just sit there with me

704
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,740
listening to this man defend himself

705
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,470
acting like we didn't just see the same tape?

706
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,300
Bro, I--it was a bad shoot. What do you want from me?

707
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,860
I'm just trying to get through this, okay?

708
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,960
I just wanna go home.

709
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,280
I don't want to get involved in things that are above us.

710
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:13,910
That's all!

711
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,950
Let me tell you what we ain't gonna do.

712
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,580
We ain't gonna say this is above our paygrade.

713
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,890
We are not going to dismiss this man as one bad apple

714
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,520
because we are in this, all right?

715
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,600
- We got stop hiding behind-- - Behind what?

716
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,770
Being white.

717
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,620
Being white? Really?

718
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,710
You don't gotta be Black to know wrong from right.

719
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,860
I never said that anything that that man did was right.

720
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,290
Did you hear me say that?

721
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,860
Think about what this white man did

722
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,340
and how the next Black kid is gonna look at you

723
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,400
- the next time you go out there. - I know.

724
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,910
I know, but I'm not doing this with you right now.

725
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,090
Why not?

726
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,570
Why not? We're here.

727
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,570
We might as well. We have been shot at,

728
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,840
chased down, all while protecting the white cop

729
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,250
that killed the Black kid, and I gotta live with that.

730
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,410
Why not you?

731
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,110
I gotta be angry. Why not you?

732
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,130
'Cause you the good white cop

733
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,960
that can't understand?

734
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,670
Who has nothing to do with any of this?

735
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,580
Is that what you're trying to say?

736
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,040
Because I don't! That's not me.

737
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,440
What's inside of him is not inside of me,

738
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,600
and you should be the one to know that!

739
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,040
How dare you, man!

740
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,990
I'm sick of you questioning me all the time.

741
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,260
Why is it me?

742
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,540
Why is it me that has to answer for this guy?

743
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,420
Huh? Ask yourself that question!

744
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,480
Yeah, you see?

745
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,770
He knows I'm innocent.

746
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,140
Shut up!

747
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,360
You know I am,

748
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,890
and your old man would say the same thing.

749
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,750
Do not talk to me about my father.

750
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,630
Okay, yeah. I feared for my life.

751
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,850
Your life wasn't even in danger!

752
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,620
And you don't think I can feel when it is?

753
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,160
I did 30 years in a warzone.

754
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,190
You know how many men I put away who shot

755
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,870
then got right back out on the street

756
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,450
and shot again?

757
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,750
How many dying kids I held in my arms?

758
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,850
How many bullets went past my head?

759
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,590
And you're gonna tell me that I don't know

760
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:10,210
when my life is danger? Huh?

761
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,880
I feared for my life!

762
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,950
You feared Jeff Duncan.

763
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,590
You saw another Black thug toting a gun.

764
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,540
Oh, man, it had nothing to do with race ever!

765
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,920
It everything to do with it.

766
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,680
Jeff was noncooperative, okay?

767
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,470
And you saw that.

768
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,520
No, I saw a man who lost empathy

769
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,540
for the people he swore to serve and protect.

770
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,510
- He resisted-- - I saw a man who was scared.

771
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,930
- He was-- - Scared of those people,

772
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,820
and you were scared way before you even pulled the trigger.

773
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,430
My life was in danger.

774
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,900
You ain't gonna do that. Not this time.

775
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,230
You're not gonna defend yourself

776
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,920
by blaming a dead Black victim.

777
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,040
Look at that.

778
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,710
Let's just calm down. Wheelan!

779
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,850
Now!

780
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,640
What did you do to it?

781
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,620
That--that ain't the video.

782
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,660
He moved. His hand moved for his weapon.

783
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,720
It moved!

784
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,850
- He did not move. - Yes, he did.

785
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,370
What, did you alter it?

786
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,070
You altered it.

787
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,520
And why would you do that? Why would you do that?

788
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,410
I know he moved, okay?

789
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,050
'Cause I saw him move. He moved.

790
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,230
Wheelan.

791
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,220
He never moved.

792
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,180
What on Earth would make you think he--

793
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,990
Adam, Kev. We got the second shooter.

794
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,610
You're all clear.

795
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,240
You go ahead and bring Wheelan in.

796
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,150
Copy that.

797
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,380
We just need you to cooperate.

798
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,070
I don't wanna answer your questions.

799
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,580
All right, talk to me.

800
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,830
It's a Scorpion.

801
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,980
Ten to one it's a match to our hit.

802
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,330
I got the shooter's phone.

803
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,370
Hank, there's a tracking signal on this phone.

804
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,310
Active?

805
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,090
Yes. And it's tracking a vehicle,

806
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,720
and the signal's being shared with someone else.

807
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,380
There's an outgoing message.

808
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,250
"Can't go. Bleeding's worse.

809
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,330
- You take Wheelan." - It's another shooter.

810
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,000
Kev, Ruzek, listen to me close.

811
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,190
You got on an active shooter tracking you right now.

812
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,200
Take cover. We're on our way.

813
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,340
Probably one of those people at Wheelan's.

814
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,640
All right, copy that.

815
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,510
How the hell did he get a tracker on your car?

816
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,630
When they were banging on the car,

817
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,060
they probably placed a tracker.

818
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,680
We gotta get the hell out of here.

819
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,820
We gotta go. Kev, you got anything?

820
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,500
- Anything, Kev? - Got it.

821
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,520
10-1, 10-1, shots fired at the police.

822
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,250
Copy that.

823
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,610
Go, go, go.

824
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,790
I gotta reload.

825
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,980
Kev, we got any extra mags in the car?

826
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,250
Naw, man, we were supposed to be a damn Uber.

827
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,520
Damn.

828
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,960
- We gotta retreat, man. - Come on.

829
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,750
Go, go, go. I got it.

830
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,980
Move, move, move.

831
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,080
- All right, move, move! - Cover me, cover me!

832
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,420
Stay down! Come on!

833
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,640
Come on, come on.

834
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,280
5021 Ida, three plainclothes officers on foot.

835
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,920
We are taking heavy fire, we are pinned down.

836
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,120
130th and Ewing. We need backup.

837
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,570
Copy, cars are rolling your way.

838
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,080
Everyone stay off the air.

839
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,180
Stay down, all right?

840
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,730
You got eyes on how many shooters?

841
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,800
- One. - There could be more.

842
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,980
I ain't see anybody else.

843
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,160
- Give me a gun. - Shh, shh.

844
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,860
How many doors on this place?

845
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,980
Just the two.

846
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,140
Well, we can't go out that way.

847
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,100
We're stuck right here.

848
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,800
I'm out of ammo. How many rounds you got?

849
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,050
Two or three.

850
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,640
You gotta take my cuffs off now.

851
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,220
No, stop, stop, stop talking. Stop talking.

852
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,260
- I'm not gonna die like this! - We're not.

853
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,450
Backup's on the way. You gotta stop talking.

854
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,300
We get clear for a sprint, I'll uncuff you.

855
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,340
We're not alone.

856
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,720
Come over here, come on.

857
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,300
Dispatch, we're going dark.

858
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,540
All I want is the man who killed my brother!

859
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,500
I'll die for that!

860
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,220
But tell me this:

861
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,010
are you willing to take a bullet for Wheelan?

862
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,470
Leave him now, and I'll let you walk away.

863
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,880
He's a murder!

864
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,570
This is the easiest decision you're ever gonna have to make!

865
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,910
Leave him, you walk!

866
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,280
Stay, you die with him!

867
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,330
You know I have the shot.

868
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,520
Leave him!

869
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,430
Drop the weapon!

870
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,610
Come out with your hands high!

871
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,110
He's upper level, right corner.

872
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,850
It's just him. There's one weapon.

873
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,240
Draw his fire. I'll move.

874
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,760
Ready?

875
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,810
Go, go.

876
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,000
Wheelan, move!

877
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,270
Leave me.

878
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,070
What?

879
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,360
Just get the hell out of here, okay?

880
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,700
No one will ever know.

881
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,570
I'm serious. Go!

882
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,510
Listen, listen.

883
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,960
The only reason for him to stop shooting

884
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,200
is because he's trying to get on top of us.

885
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,370
- I need you to stay down. - Okay, listen.

886
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,320
I was--you were right. I was scared.

887
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,720
Okay, I was scared.

888
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,760
I don't know why,

889
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,550
but he saw it, okay?

890
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,270
I murdered that kid, didn't I?

891
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,120
Stay down.

892
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,200
I said leave me!

893
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,630
Hang on! I got this.

894
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,450
Here I am! Here I am!

895
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,500
Stay down. Kev, you good?

896
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,780
- Kev! - I'm good.

897
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,190
Yeah, I'm good.

898
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,490
Hey. Wheelan!

899
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,500
Uh-uh. Not like that.

900
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,010
Uh-uh. That's too damn easy.

901
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,940
That's too damn easy. Come on.

902
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,760
You ain't gonna go out like that!

903
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,080
Not you!

904
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,610
Not like that.

905
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,850
- Ruz, you good? - Look at me.

906
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,480
Yeah, up top.

907
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,480
- Sarge, I'm gonna go up. - Come on.

908
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,740
Come on, Wheelan. Come on.

909
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,730
He's gone, Kev.

910
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,510
It's not fair. It's not fair.

911
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:14,910
That's too easy.

912
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,590
It's okay. You did your job.

913
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,360
Mm, I got my psych results back.

914
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,620
"Officer Ruzek has an uncompromising loyalty

915
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,750
to the police force. This could be problematic."

916
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,060
How about, "Officer Atwater has a lack of trust

917
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,580
"for his fellow officer.

918
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,480
This could be problematic."

919
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,130
"Appropriate loyalty,

920
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,090
"Commendable level of empathy...

921
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,060
Appropriately tempered to protect and serve."

922
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,590
They made you take the test, Sarge?

923
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,940
Those were Dave Wheelan's results

924
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,340
a week ago.

925
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,740
People are a thousand things, you know?

926
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,060
You throw them in this job, this system,

927
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,360
one moment,

928
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,310
you know, blink of an eye, what comes out...

929
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,830
Comes out.

930
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,180
I mean, how are you supposed to stop something

931
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,600
you can't see coming?

932
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,370
Yeah.

933
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,090
You both did good today.

934
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,670
I guess I should be getting home too.

935
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,710
You good?

936
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,110
I'm here.

937
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,630
Wheelan believed Jeff moved.

938
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,130
Swore he saw something that didn't happen.

939
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,160
Wheelan didn't know he had it in him.

940
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,600
What if you can't see it coming?
