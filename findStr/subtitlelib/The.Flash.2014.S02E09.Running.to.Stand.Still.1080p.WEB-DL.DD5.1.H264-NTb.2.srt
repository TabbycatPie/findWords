1
00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:02,679
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:05,807
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:07,053
To the outside world,

4
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:09,144
I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,

5
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:12,233
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

6
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:15,775
I fight crime and find other
meta-humans like me.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,712
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

8
00:00:17,747 --> 00:00:21,317
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats.

9
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:24,417
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

10
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:26,987
I am The Flash.

11
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:30,373
Previously on "The Flash"...

12
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:31,509
You're just letting us go?

13
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:33,309
Just remember
who it was made sure

14
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:35,408
you didn't
get thrown on that plane.

15
00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:37,014
I call it the Wizard's Wand.

16
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:38,660
Captain Singh mentioned there
may be positions available

17
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:40,328
on your anti-meta-human
task force.

18
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:42,771
- Why do you want to do this?
- Mark Mardon killed my dad.

19
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:48,750
James Jesse, Your Honor,
AKA... the Trickster.

20
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,785
You're going to prison
either way, James.

21
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:53,421
You stay away from me and
you stay away from my father.

22
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,290
If he finds out
that he might have a son

23
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:56,691
that grew up
without knowing him,

24
00:00:56,693 --> 00:00:57,750
it would crush him.

25
00:00:57,785 --> 00:00:59,805
Jesse's my daughter
and Zoom has her.

26
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:03,648
You're next.

27
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:34,128
Go ahead. Kill me.

28
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,532
But... my daughter...

29
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:40,001
is innocent.

30
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:41,536
Please...

31
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:43,171
Let...

32
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:45,607
Jesse...

33
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,709
live...

34
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,146
Go on.

35
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:54,849
Say something!

36
00:01:57,854 --> 00:02:01,389
Merry Christmas.

38
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:12,600
Whoo.

39
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:14,669
I had to fight some
old lady for the last one.

40
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,637
They didn't have
any Green Arrow dolls.

41
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,706
Don't know why you'd want
a toy of that crazy man.

42
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,208
I can't figure out
what to get Barry.

43
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,878
I was thinking
you could give him this.

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,613
Oh, that's nice.

45
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:27,448
But I kind of want to get him
something more meaningful.

46
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,385
I mean, it's been a strange,
emotional 12 months.

47
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:33,721
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

48
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:36,757
Oh, I know, babe.
I miss Eddie too.

49
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,361
How about you get Barry
a really nice watch?

50
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:42,563
Like Grandpa Ben gave to you.

51
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:44,465
That ain't a bad idea.

52
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:46,167
You know, my dad only
gave me this watch

53
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:47,869
because I was always late.

54
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:49,637
- You?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,640
He always gave a gift
with a not-so-hidden message,

56
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:54,709
like this watch or the time
he bought me free weights

57
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,777
because he said
I was too skinny.

58
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:58,613
I told him, "When I have a son,

59
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:01,315
I'm only giving him
fun presents."

60
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:04,886
This thing barely works.
Don't know why I still wear it.

61
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:10,758
Because it's from family.

62
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,694
You sure you're all right?

63
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:16,230
Yeah, yeah. I promise.

64
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:23,571
You know, we should really be
more professional.

65
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:25,740
You do realize
you initiated that.

66
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:28,943
Yes, and I'm fully prepared
to reprimand myself then.

67
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:31,946
I'm just saying, you know,
anyone could walk in,

68
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:35,783
like, Joe or Captain...

69
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:37,184
Yo.

70
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:40,054
But I have, like,
a 4:00 to 12:00, but...

71
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:42,790
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, all right.

72
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:45,660
- I'll see you for Christmas.
- Yeah, okay. Bye.

73
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:51,399
I'm so happy for you. Truly.

74
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:54,001
Thank you.

75
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:57,071
It means a lot to me
that you like her.

76
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:59,607
I don't know.

77
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,678
Wells, he left me
that message where he said

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,113
that I'd never really be happy.

79
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:08,816
And for a while I really started
to believe him,

80
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:11,319
but, now... I... I don't know.

81
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:15,156
Maybe there is a way to...

82
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,024
Are you okay? What's wrong?

83
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:18,492
I'm so sorry.

84
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:20,695
I can't keep this
in anymore, Barry.

85
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:22,463
I know I was so mad
at you and Dad

86
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:24,332
for not telling me that
you were The Flash,

87
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:26,233
but when I found out about this,

88
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:27,802
I didn't know what to do.

89
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:29,670
What? What's going on?

90
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:34,342
When Francine came back,
my Dad told me not to trust her

91
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:35,977
and he was right.

92
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:40,681
I didn't know how much.

93
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:44,251
When my mother left us,

94
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:46,854
she was pregnant.

95
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:49,323
She had a son.

96
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:52,727
Joe's son. My brother.

97
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:58,733
What's his name?

98
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:01,335
Wally.

99
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:04,372
Wally West.

100
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:06,641
When I found out,
I told her to leave

101
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:09,043
and never come back
and to never tell my dad,

102
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,678
but Barry, I feel...

103
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,080
I feel like this
is hollowing me out.

104
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:15,349
Every time I look at Dad,
I feel like I'm hurting him.

105
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,251
I don't...
I don't know what to do.

106
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:19,587
I think you know
what you have to do.

107
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,422
I can't. It's gonna kill him.

108
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:23,190
No, it won't.

109
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:26,060
You don't have to do this alone.
We can tell him together.

110
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:27,928
Thank you.

111
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,965
Yeah.

112
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:37,004
Hey, look. Snow.

113
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:41,308
Maybe it'll be
a white Christmas.

114
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,477
That'd be nice.

115
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,316
I was thinking
that if we could inject

116
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:52,353
an unstable neutrino burst
into the individual breaches,

117
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:54,455
it might cause them
to seal on their own.

118
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:55,923
And stop Zoom
from travelling back and forth

119
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:57,558
between our worlds.

120
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,126
At least then we wouldn't
have to worry about him

121
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:01,762
sending any more meta-humans
over for Barry to fight.

122
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:03,564
- It means a lot.
- What does?

123
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:06,167
You looking after Barry.

124
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:08,069
He's been through a lot
the last few weeks.

125
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:11,739
Barry's not the only person
here I want to keep safe.

126
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:14,041
Oh, dear Lord,
just kiss already.

127
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:17,678
- Oh, the thirst is real.
- Is everything all right?

128
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,246
Yeah, I keep checking,

129
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:21,082
but all is quiet
on the meta-human front.

130
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:23,117
Hey, you think Zoom decided
to take Christmas off?

131
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,652
What's Christmas?

132
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:27,555
Oh, well,
it's this holiday we have

133
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:29,423
where we cut down trees
and sing songs

134
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,792
to celebrate the birth
of a baby 2,000 years ago,

135
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:34,929
and then the Romans killed him
so we give each other gifts...

136
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,597
That's your explanation?

137
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,800
- I know what Christmas is.
- Oh, right, of course.

138
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,469
You know, Joe and Barry and Iris

139
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:43,137
are having people over
for Christmas Eve,

140
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,240
and they said we could
invite whoever we want.

141
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:48,476
- Who... who do you want?
- You.

142
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,645
I want to invite you, I mean.

143
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,914
This is so painful.
Have you guys seen Harry?

144
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,983
No, I have not.
I told him to rest.

145
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:57,451
He's just as stubborn
as all the rest of

146
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:59,320
my male patients in this place.

147
00:06:59,322 --> 00:07:00,755
I'm gonna
leave you two alone, okay?

148
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:02,189
I'm gonna go find Harry.

149
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:03,624
Holy Hannah!

150
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:06,427
- Hi.
- Hi.

151
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:09,663
- Everything okay?
- Sure.

152
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:11,766
Why wouldn't it be?

153
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:14,802
Why wouldn't it be?

154
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,543
Man, it's really coming down.

155
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:25,379
The news didn't
say anything about snow.

156
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:27,181
Maybe it's a Christmas miracle.

157
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:38,959
Let it snow.

158
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:40,504
We got a code...

159
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:49,970
Knock, knock.

160
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,077
So.

161
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,281
Early parole. You interested?

162
00:08:01,784 --> 00:08:05,619
Don't mean to be a noodge,
but the exit is upstairs.

163
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:08,589
Just need one more thing.

164
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,459
_

165
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,768
You got to be kidding me.

166
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:24,405
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

167
00:08:36,987 --> 00:08:38,818
Please tell me
this is not happening...

168
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,381
It's official, Santa hates us.

169
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,945
This sudden blizzard
took out cameras

170
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,388
and the security system.

171
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,304
I mean, thank God
nobody was killed,

172
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,343
but there's no trace
of Mardon, Jesse, or Snart.

173
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:51,872
Speaking of which,
with Mardon back on the scene...

174
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:52,655
Yeah?

175
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,141
Patty might not be
thinking so clearly.

176
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:55,696
What do you mean?

177
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:58,767
What does Mardon
have to do with Patty?

178
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,407
We should have expected this.

179
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,745
The unexpected drop
in barometric pressure

180
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:11,113
had to mean
Mardon was back in town.

181
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:12,548
Patty...

182
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,450
Jesse was on full
communication lock down,

183
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:15,651
but that doesn't mean Mardon
and Snart weren't in contact.

184
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:20,389
Patty, Joe told me about Mardon.

185
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:22,892
I can't talk to you about this.

186
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:24,827
Hey, Patty, it's okay.

187
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:27,763
Got it.

188
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:29,632
Look, Barry, you're a
really sweet guy,

189
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:31,300
but you have no idea what's
really going on in this city.

190
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:34,570
I mean, you don't even
know that Harrison Wells...

191
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,839
I'm sorry, I don't have time
to bring you up to speed.

192
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:38,674
That's ironic.

193
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:41,243
Patty, Patty,
look I care about you a lot.

194
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,512
I don't want to see you
do anything reckless.

195
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:45,080
I'm a cop.

196
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:46,782
Going after criminals
is in my job description.

197
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:48,651
It's not reckless.

198
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:51,487
And powers or not, Mardon's
gonna answer for what he's done.

199
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:53,522
Patty...

200
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,892
♪ Deck the halls ♪

201
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:59,228
♪ With body parts
from a girl named Holly ♪

202
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,231
♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪

203
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,833
I don't remember those
being the lyrics.

204
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:08,971
I am tremendously creative.
That I can tell you.

205
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,372
You'd better be.
I didn't break you out...

206
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:11,974
I didn't break
either of you out,

207
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:13,575
because I was looking to make
some new friends.

208
00:10:13,577 --> 00:10:16,345
That is not the holiday
spirit, Marky-Mark.

209
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:18,847
Christmas is a time
for togetherness.

210
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:22,017
And what says togetherness
more than mass graves?

211
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,286
- Hmm?
- So why did you break us out?

212
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,588
Well, I owed you one,

213
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,724
and this guy, he's just crazy.

214
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:30,526
It's a compliment.

215
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:32,061
And we all want the same thing.

216
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,397
- Fashion advice?
- To see The Flash dead.

217
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,433
Well, that was more of a
New Years resolution,

218
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:39,001
but, hey, I'm flexible.

219
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:42,338
That hasn't gone so well
for anyone in this room.

220
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,773
What makes you think
you can stop him this time?

221
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:46,175
Three against one.

222
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:48,944
Plus, the one
isn't quite what he was.

223
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:52,414
See, another speedster
dressed all in black

224
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,883
nearly took him out
a few weeks ago.

225
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:57,052
He's vulnerable. He's weak.

226
00:10:57,054 --> 00:11:00,456
It's a mistake
to underestimate him.

227
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:05,260
With my power,
his... flair, and your smarts,

228
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:07,262
we can put him
in the ground for good.

229
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:09,431
- Tell me your plan.
- Tell me you're in.

230
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,867
- I'm thinking about it.
- What's the matter?

231
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:14,536
A few months in the clink
make you soft, did it, Snart?

232
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:19,842
- You wanna dance?
- Boys, boys, boys!

233
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:22,311
Play nice! Mellow out, Mardon.

234
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:25,180
Don't have a snit, Snart.
Here's an idea.

235
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:28,150
We all go out, have a few
drinks, kill some carolers.

236
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:30,352
We'll all feel better.

237
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:33,122
All right.

238
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:36,158
So what's it gonna be, Snart?

239
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:40,696
Oh, yeah.

240
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:43,432
The Weather Wizard,
Captain Cold, and the Trickster.

241
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,000
There's three of them
and one of you.

242
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:46,602
I do not like those odds.

243
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:48,737
And I'm gonna be no help
without my speed, so...

244
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:52,307
Oh, oh, light bulb up here.
I have an idea.

245
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:55,077
Most weather phenomena
are marked, no pun intended,

246
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,913
by the change of electric charge
and pressure in the atmosphere.

247
00:11:57,915 --> 00:12:00,048
We could just
map out those fluctuations...

248
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,617
To pinpoint his location.

249
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,285
Right, it would just be
a matter of removing all...

250
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,920
The electricity
from his immediate surroundings.

251
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:06,422
Attracting it to one spot.

252
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:07,956
The same way
a lightning rod does.

253
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,625
Only instead of a lightning rod,
we could use...

254
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:11,393
A wand?

255
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:13,095
Have we already had
this conversation?

256
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:16,865
- Kind of.
- What does that mean?

257
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,934
All right, so the last time
Mardon attacked,

258
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:21,804
he, um, generated a tidal wave
that destroyed

259
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:23,338
all of Central City.

260
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,808
So why are you not all
sleeping with the fishes?

261
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,609
Earth-2 has "The Godfather"?

262
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:30,112
Every Earth
has "The Godfather," Vito.

263
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:32,080
So I ran back through time.

264
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,616
One day into the past
and I got a do-over

265
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:36,718
and I stopped Mardon
before he could hurt anyone.

266
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,353
You shouldn't have
messed with the timeline.

267
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:39,888
That's what
the other Wells said.

268
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,024
So the good news is,
in that timeline,

269
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:43,425
you created The Wand
and it worked.

270
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:44,927
So you just got to do it again.

271
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:46,462
For the first time.

272
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,931
- Yeah, no pressure.
- I can give you a hand.

273
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:51,700
- Best of both worlds?
- I like that.

274
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:56,505
You good, Harry?

275
00:12:56,507 --> 00:13:00,242
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

276
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:01,944
Holiday blues?

277
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:03,912
It can't be easy knowing Zoom
still has his daughter.

278
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:05,814
Yeah, all right,
look, I'll be right back.

279
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:07,416
I have something
I have to deal with.

280
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,893
Hey.

281
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:22,164
Okay, the last time
the two of you

282
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,632
were looking at me like that,

283
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:25,300
it was when you both
took my convertible

284
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:26,702
on a joy ride
and wrapped it around

285
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:28,370
that big oak tree
on Fairmont Drive.

286
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:32,040
Dad...

287
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,909
All right, Joe, we have
something we need to tell you.

288
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:36,812
No...

289
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:39,948
I have something
that I need to tell you.

290
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,952
It's about Francine.

291
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:53,829
When she left us...

292
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:58,267
she was pregnant.

293
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:21,256
Did she have the baby?

294
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:23,692
Yes.

295
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:27,229
His name is Wally.

296
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:29,598
Wally West.

297
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:34,603
Short for Wallace.

298
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:39,708
That's what we were gonna
name you if you were a boy.

299
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,843
I only found out
a couple weeks ago.

300
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:45,614
Dad, I am so sorry
that I didn't tell you sooner.

301
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:50,852
That's why she reached out to us
after all these years.

302
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:54,122
She wanted us to know before...

303
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:58,560
Before she died.

304
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:02,364
And I thought Francine
was running out of surprises.

305
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:06,301
I got to get to work.

306
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:08,570
Dad, listen... Dad.

307
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:12,040
I'm... I'm sorry.

308
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:16,445
Just let me sit with it.

309
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,123
Do you think that
he's gonna be okay?

310
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,359
I do, yeah, I think...

311
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:32,728
It's just a lot to take in.

312
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,264
He just needs a little time
to process it.

313
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,700
Ho, ho, ho.

314
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,462
Cocoa isn't cocoa without
the mini marshmallows.

315
00:15:50,497 --> 00:15:52,905
And you're out. I checked.

316
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,942
Are you out of your mind?

317
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:56,331
Breaking into my home?

318
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:58,978
Careful. I made an upgrade
to the cold gun.

319
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:00,323
If I release my grip
from the handle,

320
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:01,749
the core goes critical.

321
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:03,951
You might make it,

322
00:16:03,953 --> 00:16:07,021
she won't.

323
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:14,962
Read your article on the
disappearing middle class.

324
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:17,331
Strong point of view.
Nice prose style.

325
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,066
Yeah, well, who needs a Pulitzer

326
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:21,535
when you have a homicidal
maniac's seal of approval.

327
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:23,737
Didn't Barry tell you?
I had a rough childhood.

328
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:26,040
Everyone in this room
had a rough childhood.

329
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:28,042
- Get over it.
- Why are you here, Snart?

330
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:30,945
I got the Noel spirit,
wanted to give you a gift.

331
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:33,380
Mardon broke Jesse
and me out to kill you.

332
00:16:33,382 --> 00:16:35,983
Jesse's on board, of course.
He's shaking with excitement.

333
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:37,918
Me, I'm gonna pass.

334
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,353
Why? You grow a conscience?

335
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:41,588
Mardon wants revenge.
Jesse wants chaos.

336
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,325
I'm just not invested
like they are.

337
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:46,193
You mean there's no money
in it for you?

338
00:16:46,195 --> 00:16:48,629
I was never much
for non-profit work.

339
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:50,664
If you're not in with them,
then tell me where they are.

340
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,267
Nah, consider me more
of a secret Santa.

341
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,971
Besides, you and your friends
love to solve a good mystery.

342
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:01,642
You are full of it, Snart.

343
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:05,012
I think my friends and I
saved your sister's life

344
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:07,114
and you can't stand
owing me a marker.

345
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:08,549
I hate to break it to you,

346
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:10,951
but that... that right there
is called honor.

347
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:14,855
Go on, make your pitch.
I can see you're dying to.

348
00:17:14,857 --> 00:17:16,890
Help me stop them.

349
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:20,527
Sorry, I'm not interested
in being a hero.

350
00:17:21,998 --> 00:17:23,630
Well, you're doing
a pretty lousy job

351
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:26,300
of being a villain this week.

352
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:28,869
Merry Christmas, Barry.

353
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:40,347
Hey.

354
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,487
I was just thinking
about a big drug bust

355
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:49,490
that me and Singh
made about ten years ago.

356
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:54,228
Afterward,
we went for a steak lunch

357
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,830
to treat ourselves
for a job well done

358
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:58,899
and while we were ordering,

359
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:01,468
I got this feeling in my chest.

360
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,371
Like my heart
was being squeezed.

361
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:06,106
I knew something wasn't right.

362
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:08,142
So I called your school

363
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:13,047
and the nurse said to me that
she was just about to call me.

364
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,049
Iris was on her way
to the hospital.

365
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,683
When her appendix burst.

366
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:19,386
And I knew it.
I could feel it, right here.

367
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:23,557
I knew my kid needed me.

368
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,094
So if I have that feeling
as a parent,

369
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:29,096
why didn't I feel it
from my son?

370
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:31,965
Joe, it's not your fault that
you didn't know about him.

371
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,935
Yeah, it was.

372
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:38,105
When Francine left rehab
that last time,

373
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,340
I should've looked for her.

374
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:42,276
I'm a cop. I could've found her.

375
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:43,944
Brought her back here.

376
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:45,345
Tried again. Tried harder.

377
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:46,880
You were protecting Iris.

378
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:49,783
I've been telling
myself that for 20 years.

379
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:51,718
A 20-year lie,
but I wasn't protecting her,

380
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,956
I was protecting myself.
I couldn't stand it anymore.

381
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,325
I couldn't...

382
00:18:58,327 --> 00:19:03,030
I hated not being able
to help Francine.

383
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:07,167
So it was easier
for her to be dead.

384
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:11,605
Out of my life.
Out of our lives.

385
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:14,007
But it wasn't for Iris.

386
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:15,876
I was being selfish.

387
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:19,513
And that poor boy
paid the price.

388
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:21,615
Joe...

389
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:25,452
He never had a father...

390
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:27,788
to read to him at night,
show him to throw a football,

391
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,624
to make him feel safe.

392
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:33,660
And loved.

393
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:39,366
Who taught him
how to be a man, Barry?

394
00:19:39,368 --> 00:19:43,103
"Him."
I can't even say his name.

395
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,943
What have I done?

396
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:53,280
Joe, look,

397
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,582
you have been there for me

398
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:58,785
every day since I met you.

399
00:19:58,787 --> 00:20:00,988
You have.

400
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:05,759
You would have done
the exact same thing for him

401
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:10,364
if you could have, I know it.

402
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:12,499
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:17,704
Where's your partner, Spivot?

404
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:20,941
I don't know,
I'm not his babysitter.

405
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:24,444
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not sure where Joe is.

Get TARU down here now.

412
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:47,267
I want to know
how he's doing this.

413
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:49,736
Citizens, you know,
the holidays can be a time

414
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:52,973
for gentle reflection
on the year past.

415
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:54,441
Our ups and downs,

416
00:20:54,443 --> 00:20:57,110
our triumphs and heartaches,

417
00:20:57,112 --> 00:21:00,514
but don't forget,
it can also be a time

418
00:21:00,516 --> 00:21:03,417
for disemboweling our enemies.

419
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,185
We don't have
a Trickster on Earth-2.

420
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:06,653
He's one of a kind.

421
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:08,789
My stocking won't be
completely stuffed

422
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:13,627
until it's filled to the brim
with bloody Flash parts.

423
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:16,597
So what do you say, speed freak?

424
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:20,334
You wanna roast chestnuts?

425
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:22,135
I want all tactical units
on high alert.

426
00:21:22,137 --> 00:21:23,670
Get in touch
with other precincts,

427
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:25,839
I want watch commanders
coordinating deployment.

428
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:27,207
Spivot, I need you to...

429
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:28,909
Spivot!

430
00:21:28,911 --> 00:21:30,744
Are there any clues as to
where he is based on the video?

431
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:33,213
None that I can see.

432
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:35,916
Guys, there's a reflection

433
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:38,885
of something in his cornea, see?

434
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:43,790
- What is that?
- Not sure.

435
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:45,559
That's Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.

436
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:47,594
- Come again?
- It's a doll.

437
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:49,029
A stuffed children's toy.

438
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:50,731
I gave one to my daughter
when she was six.

439
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,966
Mr. Jiggle Wiggle was
manufactured by Okamura Toys...

440
00:21:52,968 --> 00:21:54,501
Yahtzee!

441
00:21:54,503 --> 00:21:56,370
Okamura once had a shipping
facility in Central City

442
00:21:56,372 --> 00:21:58,305
that shut down four years ago;
it's been abandoned ever since.

443
00:21:58,307 --> 00:22:00,941
What if Weather Wizard's there?
The wand's not finished.

444
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:02,542
The Trickster is.

445
00:22:18,327 --> 00:22:19,860
What are you doing here?

446
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:22,195
Same thing as you.
Trying to catch a murderer.

00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:57,358
closed casket funerals.

457
00:22:57,393 --> 00:22:58,601
There's nowhere for me
to run us to!

458
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:02,408
- So what should we do?
- Hold me.

459
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,845
- I'm seeing someone.
- Me too. Don't let go.

460
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,825
Detective.

461
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:21,360
It was all just a trap for you.

462
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:23,162
Mardon and Jesse
aren't even here.

463
00:23:23,164 --> 00:23:25,398
- They're still on the loose.
- How did you know to come here?

464
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,832
Because there was a reflection

465
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:28,234
in Jesse's eye
of Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.

466
00:23:28,236 --> 00:23:30,403
And that's the thing
that my dad...

467
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:32,238
It doesn't even matter.

468
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,341
That's why you came here alone
without any backup?

469
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:36,842
Because of your father?

470
00:23:36,844 --> 00:23:38,744
You don't know
anything about me.

471
00:23:38,746 --> 00:23:40,746
I know
that you're being reckless.

472
00:23:40,748 --> 00:23:42,548
And I'm sure
the people in your life

473
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,384
care enough about you to not
want to see you get hurt.

474
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:48,754
Except Mardon
didn't kill my father.

475
00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:50,689
I did.

476
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:52,992
See, he had a little shoe shop,
and we didn't have any money,

477
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:54,393
so I worked there after school.

478
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:57,063
Except one day
I decided not to show up,

479
00:23:57,065 --> 00:24:01,801
because I was being stupid
and silly with my friends.

480
00:24:01,803 --> 00:24:04,203
I didn't even call to tell him
that I was ditching.

481
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:07,973
So he brought
the deposits to the bank,

482
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:10,776
not me.

483
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:14,647
He was shot and killed
by Mardon, not me.

484
00:24:16,284 --> 00:24:18,584
That's why you became a cop.

485
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:20,486
Joined the meta-human
task force.

486
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:22,888
It'll be legal
when I kill Mardon.

487
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,891
I have made my whole life about
getting justice for my father,

488
00:24:25,893 --> 00:24:27,993
even if it meant
I didn't have a life

489
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:29,762
and now I met
a really great guy,

490
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:31,964
and that doesn't even
feel real to me

491
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:35,935
and I'm scared he's gonna
find out how angry I am.

492
00:24:35,937 --> 00:24:38,104
I don't even know why
I'm telling you this.

493
00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:40,372
Sometimes it's just easier
to say things

494
00:24:40,374 --> 00:24:42,708
to someone with no face.

495
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,877
Thank you for saving me.

496
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:47,346
You know, even if you get
this guy that wronged you,

497
00:24:47,348 --> 00:24:49,815
it doesn't always
make things better.

498
00:24:49,817 --> 00:24:52,451
It has to be better than this.

499
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:07,333
Patty, it's me. Again.

500
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:09,969
I'd really love to talk.
I'm worried about you.

501
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:14,573
Anyway, just give me a call when
you get a chance, all right?

502
00:25:14,575 --> 00:25:17,710
Thank you. Bye.

503
00:25:17,712 --> 00:25:19,812
- Barry.
- Yeah?

504
00:25:19,814 --> 00:25:22,181
How's it look?

505
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:23,883
Wow, eerily familiar.

506
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:25,484
How's Patty?

507
00:25:25,486 --> 00:25:27,453
She is, um,

508
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:29,989
hiding a lot of pain
behind her smile.

509
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:31,624
They say couples start
to resemble each other

510
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:33,726
after a little while.

511
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:36,195
The thing is, I mean, she only
opened up to Flash, not me.

512
00:25:36,197 --> 00:25:37,396
So even if I could got her
on the phone,

513
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:39,064
I don't know what to say.

514
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:41,167
Well, it's been my experience

515
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:43,269
that just being around you
can be a big help.

516
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:44,803
Thank you.

517
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:52,077
I want an iPhone,
an iPad, and an iTouch.

518
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,914
Ho, ho, ho, dial it back,
Mr. Greedy.

519
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:57,816
Those are a little out
of Santa's price range.

520
00:25:57,818 --> 00:26:01,020
How about this?

521
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:05,524
Now remember,
don't open it until tomorrow.

522
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,594
It's a surprise.

523
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,011
Have you decided?

524
00:26:26,013 --> 00:26:29,148
- I need more time.
- Don't we all.

525
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,884
- Decide.
- I need more time.

526
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:35,354
Maybe if I go up there

527
00:26:35,356 --> 00:26:39,491
and kill
a few of your new friends...

528
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:42,828
- No!
- One more day.

529
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,899
I'll tell your daughter
you said, "Hello."

530
00:26:56,557 --> 00:26:58,641
- What's that? Is that Mardon?
- That's definitely him.

531
00:26:58,676 --> 00:27:00,989
Atmospheric pressure
just dropped 200 hectopascals.

532
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:02,524
- Where?
- Central City Square.

533
00:27:02,526 --> 00:27:03,588
The tree lighting ceremony.

534
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,527
There's thousands
of people there.

535
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:22,444
Oh, glad to see you.
Maybe you can help me.

536
00:27:22,446 --> 00:27:23,745
Help get back to a jail cell?

537
00:27:23,747 --> 00:27:25,747
- It'll be my pleasure, Mark.
- No.

538
00:27:25,749 --> 00:27:26,948
No, see, I'm trying to decide

539
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,517
if I should kill
everybody down there

540
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,253
with a deadly hail storm,
or... little trickier,

541
00:27:31,255 --> 00:27:33,455
with acid rain,
what do you think?

542
00:27:33,457 --> 00:27:35,624
Let me think...

543
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:36,992
How about neither?

544
00:27:36,994 --> 00:27:39,928
You see this wand here?
Guess what?

545
00:27:42,232 --> 00:27:45,434
Um... guys? He's flying.

546
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:47,769
He can fly?
Since when can he fly?

547
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:50,439
Well, he's using his
powers to alter the air pressure

548
00:27:50,441 --> 00:27:52,841
around him to create
pockets of updraft that can...

549
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:54,710
No, he can fly.

550
00:27:54,712 --> 00:27:56,244
- Barry, get him.
- Yeah.

551
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:28,977
You didn't really think
I'd let you hurt

552
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:30,846
all these people, did you?

553
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,781
No, of course not,

554
00:28:32,783 --> 00:28:36,618
but bet you're gonna let me
hurt you.

555
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:41,156
Feliz Navidad!

556
00:28:41,158 --> 00:28:44,526
Time for a real
war on Christmas.

557
00:28:44,528 --> 00:28:45,694
What is this?

558
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,130
That is a box with a bomb in it.

559
00:28:48,132 --> 00:28:53,068
Yup, I've handed out
about 100 of them today.

560
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,737
It feels so good to give.

561
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:59,908
You see, right now,
there are 100 random children

562
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,710
who've each taken home a box

563
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:03,378
just like that one

564
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,248
and are shoving it
under their Christmas tree.

565
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,316
There's no way
for you to to all of them,

566
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:10,085
even if you knew where to look.

567
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:13,255
Oh, no, Please don't do this.

568
00:29:13,257 --> 00:29:15,824
What? Me? Kill 100 families?

569
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:18,760
No, that's up to you.

570
00:29:18,762 --> 00:29:20,729
I'm happy just
to take your life.

571
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:22,697
So this is how it's gonna be.

572
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:26,635
You are gonna stand there
and let me end you.

573
00:29:26,637 --> 00:29:29,070
Very publicly

574
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:31,406
and very painfully

575
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:33,442
and I'll let everybody live,

576
00:29:33,444 --> 00:29:36,244
but if I see even

577
00:29:36,246 --> 00:29:40,415
a little flicker
of electricity on you...

578
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:42,751
the casket makers in this town

579
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:45,587
are gonna have
a very merry Christmas.

580
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:48,323
So, Flash...

581
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:50,392
what's it gonna be?

582
00:29:50,394 --> 00:29:52,194
Huh?

583
00:29:58,168 --> 00:30:01,102
There you go.

584
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:10,545
- They're gonna kill Barry!
- Unless we find those bombs.

585
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:12,347
- Cisco?
- Jay, there's no way.

586
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:13,682
There is a way.

587
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:15,984
To find 100
randomly-placed bombs?

588
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:18,086
We don't have to find 100.

589
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:20,589
We just have to find one.
And then we get rid of them all.

590
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:22,023
- How?
- A breach.

591
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:23,825
That's right.
We sent Grodd away.

592
00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:25,227
We can do the same to these
bombs, all of them.

593
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:26,461
Do you have a drone
in your workshop?

594
00:30:26,463 --> 00:30:27,629
- Yeah.
- Does it fly?

595
00:30:27,631 --> 00:30:29,164
- Yeah.
- Good.

596
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,333
I'm taking it.
You're not getting it back.

597
00:30:31,335 --> 00:30:32,834
I'll warm up the van.

598
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,785
I'm cross-referencing
credit card statements with

599
00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:53,121
toll road usage and families
with children under ten.

600
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:54,289
Hold up...

601
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,057
Make a U-turn. Two streets back.

602
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:06,668
Your toys. Give them to me.

603
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,336
Mom!

604
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:11,406
Flash, you all right?

605
00:31:11,408 --> 00:31:13,141
You don't look so good.

606
00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:15,544
I know...

607
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:17,345
I'll give you a jolt.

608
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:30,892
Harry, what is the plan?

609
00:31:30,894 --> 00:31:33,128
One of the 52 breaches opened
by the singularity

610
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,397
is 1/4 mile
directly above the city.

611
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,866
We are gonna use your drone

612
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:40,936
to put this bomb
into that breach.

613
00:31:40,938 --> 00:31:43,405
Okay, how does that work?
One down, 99 to blow.

614
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:45,941
Basic physics, Ramon. Magnetism.

615
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:49,210
Magnetism. Magnets of opposite
poles attract one another.

616
00:31:49,212 --> 00:31:50,812
Help me out, Garrick.

617
00:31:50,814 --> 00:31:52,380
If we can change
the dimensional frequency

618
00:31:52,382 --> 00:31:54,215
of this bomb
and get it through that breach...

619
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:56,117
It'll drag all the rest of
the bombs right along with it.

620
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:58,353
I'll drive. Okay, hold on.

621
00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:06,227
I'm done.

622
00:32:06,229 --> 00:32:08,396
He's all yours.

623
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:10,365
Oh, God...

624
00:32:14,037 --> 00:32:17,405
To think this city worships you!

625
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:23,378
But, when I kill The Flash,

626
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,848
they'll realize I'm the man
who saved Central City!

627
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:45,033
It's working.

628
00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:47,435
- Was that you?
- No! Gut him!

629
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:49,604
All right, I'm gutting already.

630
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:52,741
Barry, the bombs are gone.

631
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:11,993
How do you like
the magnets, bitch?

632
00:33:19,036 --> 00:33:23,104
Detective, it's taken care of.
They can't hurt anyone else.

633
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:29,611
What are you doing?

634
00:33:29,613 --> 00:33:32,547
- What are you doing?
- This is for my father.

635
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:34,416
No, no, no, Detective!

636
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:42,186
Detective, no.
You can't do this.

637
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,996
He killed my father
for a couple hundred dollars.

638
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:48,245
What was so important that my
father had to lose his life?

639
00:33:48,247 --> 00:33:49,880
Mardon will get
what he deserves.

640
00:33:49,882 --> 00:33:52,549
- He deserves to die!
- Not like this!

641
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,837
You don't have it
in you, pretty lady.

642
00:33:54,872 --> 00:33:56,919
I've been asking myself that
for the last four years,

643
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,259
and now I know.

644
00:33:58,294 --> 00:34:00,590
No, Patty!

645
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:03,509
You pull that trigger,
your life ends too.

646
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:06,196
You will go to prison.

647
00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:08,905
Everything and everyone that
you could have had in your life

648
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,249
will be taken from you.

649
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:13,509
Again.

650
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:16,373
Mardon can't take anything else
from you unless you let him.

651
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,344
I didn't know your father, but
I know he wouldn't want this.

652
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:25,416
Not over him.

653
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:29,186
Please. Please.

654
00:34:31,009 --> 00:34:33,790
Mark Mardon,
you're under arrest.

655
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:40,430
That was beautiful.

656
00:34:45,604 --> 00:34:47,838
- Barry, hey.
- Hey.

657
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,640
Everyone's heading over
to our place for Christmas.

658
00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:52,342
You okay?

659
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:54,578
Yeah, no,
nothing a little meta-human

660
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,681
regenerative healing
capabilities won't cure.

661
00:34:57,683 --> 00:34:59,616
How'd it go with Francine?

662
00:34:59,618 --> 00:35:01,752
It was good.
It was really good, actually.

663
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:06,690
I mean, I spent so long
lying about her being dead

664
00:35:06,692 --> 00:35:08,525
that I started
to believe it myself.

665
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:11,294
But the truth is, those feelings
were always there.

666
00:35:11,296 --> 00:35:14,965
That anger, that regret,
the guilt...

667
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:18,168
I just didn't realize how much
I needed to forgive her.

668
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:23,006
And now...
there's room for another West.

669
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,674
Did you meet him?

670
00:35:24,676 --> 00:35:27,744
No. He still doesn't know.

671
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:29,513
That'll come.

672
00:35:29,515 --> 00:35:32,315
- Wow. You have a son.
- I know, right?

673
00:35:32,317 --> 00:35:33,784
It's crazy.

674
00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:37,154
- Speaking of which, take this.
- What?

675
00:35:37,156 --> 00:35:40,056
No, no, no, no,
I can't take that.

676
00:35:40,058 --> 00:35:45,796
I've always said that one day
I would give this to my son...

677
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:55,105
And now I have.

678
00:35:55,107 --> 00:35:58,909
Merry Christmas.

679
00:35:58,911 --> 00:36:00,977
Merry Christmas. Thank you.

680
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:03,914
Love you.

681
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,515
- I love you too.
- See you at the house.

682
00:36:05,517 --> 00:36:07,417
Yeah.

683
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,366
I know that you're not him...

684
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:28,505
But he's not here
and I have to say this for me.

685
00:36:28,507 --> 00:36:31,908
In that video message,

686
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,445
you said that...

687
00:36:35,447 --> 00:36:39,049
that I would never
really be happy...

688
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:46,189
And I've been trying...
I've been trying really hard.

689
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,027
After what Joe said,

690
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:53,363
and helping Patty,

691
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:56,766
I realize that
you're still in my heart.

692
00:36:59,104 --> 00:37:03,073
How much I hate you

693
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:05,275
for what you've done.

694
00:37:09,014 --> 00:37:13,650
I don't want to hate you
anymore, I can't.

695
00:37:13,652 --> 00:37:15,785
Can't hate you anymore.

696
00:37:19,091 --> 00:37:21,391
I forgive you.

697
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,500
You need me for something?

698
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:33,870
No, no, I'm good.

699
00:37:33,872 --> 00:37:39,042
You know, you should come over
for Christmas tonight.

700
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:42,479
You shouldn't be alone.

701
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:45,515
It's a nice offer.

702
00:37:45,517 --> 00:37:48,518
I can't celebrate
without my daughter.

703
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,320
All right.

704
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:05,268
- Strong enough?
- We'll see.

705
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:10,073
I'll be right back.

706
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:11,308
- Hey.
- Oh!

707
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,576
What do you have there?

708
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:14,711
- Mistletoe.
- What's mistletoe?

709
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:17,380
Oh, um,
it's a hemiparasitic plant

710
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:19,516
from the genus
Santalaceae family

711
00:38:19,518 --> 00:38:21,184
in North America, I think.

712
00:38:21,186 --> 00:38:24,020
Caitlin, I'm kidding.
We have mistletoe on Earth-2.

713
00:38:24,022 --> 00:38:27,123
Right, of course.

714
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:30,794
We also have this
tradition over there.

715
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,901
We have that tradition here too.

716
00:38:37,903 --> 00:38:39,302
- Aww.
- Finally.

717
00:38:39,304 --> 00:38:40,770
Oh, let me get that.

718
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:42,172
- Eggnog, please?
- Yeah.

719
00:38:42,174 --> 00:38:43,707
Hi, I'm so glad
you could make it.

720
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:45,175
Aw, thank you for having me.

721
00:38:45,177 --> 00:38:46,343
Merry Christmas.
This is for you.

722
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:48,612
- Thank you.
- Of course.

723
00:38:48,614 --> 00:38:50,213
- Hey.
- Hi.

724
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:51,448
I've been really
worried about you.

725
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,083
- I've been calling.
- I know...

726
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:55,151
and I'm really sorry.

727
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:57,487
I just have been dealing
with something by myself,

728
00:38:57,489 --> 00:39:00,223
but I want to tell you about it.

729
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:02,626
I think that I'm ready to.

730
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:04,794
Someone reminded me
of what's important,

731
00:39:04,796 --> 00:39:08,164
so if you want to hear, I
would like to share it with you.

732
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,733
That would be
the best gift I could get.

733
00:39:09,735 --> 00:39:11,368
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,004
I don't know.
This is a really sweet sweater.

735
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:15,972
I hope it's as
sweet as this one.

736
00:39:15,974 --> 00:39:18,008
It's matching.

737
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,376
- Thank you.
- Of course.

738
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:21,678
- Detective Spivot.
- Hi!

739
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,247
- What brings you here?
- Merry Christmas.

740
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:29,152
Well, I'm... Barry's girlfriend.

741
00:39:29,154 --> 00:39:31,788
- About time.
- Cheers.

742
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:34,391
Are we expecting anybody else?

743
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:36,860
- Not that I know of.
- Maybe Harry changed his mind.

744
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,837
Hi, I'm Wally.
I'm Francine's son.

745
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,248
I'm... I'm... I'm Joe.

746
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,184
This is Iris.

747
00:40:01,186 --> 00:40:04,287
- Hi.
- Hi.

748
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:10,093
I just wanted to...

749
00:40:10,095 --> 00:40:12,195
I don't know.

750
00:40:12,197 --> 00:40:14,864
I guess now's a bad time.
You've got company, so...

751
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:17,133
No. No, no, no. Come in.

752
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,954
Time's up, Wells.

753
00:40:37,956 --> 00:40:40,623
What's it gonna be?

754
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,959
I know what you're doing.

755
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:46,963
I know why you keep sending
villain after villain

756
00:40:46,965 --> 00:40:49,799
from our Earth to this one.

757
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:52,302
You want Barry to get faster.

758
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:56,573
You want him to get stronger.

759
00:40:56,575 --> 00:41:00,677
You want him to become more
powerful, more full of...

760
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:03,079
speed force.

761
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,086
You're fattening him up
like a Christmas goose.

762
00:41:10,088 --> 00:41:12,155
The more power he has,

763
00:41:12,157 --> 00:41:15,358
the more I can take

764
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,295
and you're going to help me.

765
00:41:19,297 --> 00:41:21,531
Let me see her first.

766
00:41:24,703 --> 00:41:26,069
Daddy?

767
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:33,343
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

768
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:34,878
Please help me.

769
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,513
Don't let him
take me back there.

770
00:41:36,515 --> 00:41:38,681
I won't...

771
00:41:38,683 --> 00:41:41,017
Now decide.

772
00:41:41,019 --> 00:41:45,755
In return
for your daughter's life...

773
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:48,091
I'll do it.

774
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:55,298
I'll help you steal
The Flash's speed.

775
