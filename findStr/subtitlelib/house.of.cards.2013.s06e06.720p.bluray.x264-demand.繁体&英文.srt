00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,360
辭職
Resign.

她死了嗎
Is she dead?

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,570
她在沙特阿拉伯的某個地方

33
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,140
但必須有行政命令才能執行

00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,970
那...
Well, then.

35
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,030
等你當了總統  再發布行政命令好了
That's gonna have to happen when you're president.

36
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,480
是俄羅斯人殺了湯姆
The Russians killed Tom...

37
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,340
馬克·厄舍幫忙掩蓋了事實
and Mark Usher covered it up.

38
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,750
我要你告訴聯調局
I need you to tell the FBI

你和湯姆的關系
about your relationship with Tom.

You're all fired.

41
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,910
問問安奈特
Ask Annette--

42
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,350
問問你媽媽
Ask your mother.

43
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,520
她讓我問你我從哪來的
She told me to ask you where I came from.

44
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,920
見過我的新內閣
Meet my new cabinet.

45
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,800
我就想看看你的表情
I just wanted to see your face.

46
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,300
你扣下的遺囑在哪  你放哪了
The will you intercepted? Where is it?

47
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,150
已經不在我這兒了
I don't have it anymore.

48
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,610
他把一切都留給了你
He left you everything.

49
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,130
遺囑的結語就是這樣的
That's how the will ends.

50
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,090
"記住我最后給你的那樣東西"
"Remember the last thing I gave you."

51
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,620
弗蘭西斯死在這間屋子里

殺了他的人
Whoever killed him

53
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,150
將得到她或他應有的下場

湯姆  你在嗎
Tom, you here?

56
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,460
湯姆
Tom!

57
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,480
知情人士稱聯調局已經掌握了相關證據
Sources say that the FBI was made aware of the evidence

58
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,610
證實副總統及多名內閣成員

59
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,490
與俄羅斯政府高層有聯系
with several senior Russian government officials.

60
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,150
與此同時  安德伍德總統
Meanwhile, President Underwood,

61
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,160
盡管仍未對此事發表任何評論
who has still not commented on the matter,

62
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,820
卻也有所動作  可能是為了撇清自己
in what could be construed as an attempt to distance herself

63
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,410
以及本屆政府與通俄事件的關系
and her administration from the apparent collusion,

64
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,580
她解除了所有遭指控閣員的職務
has fired all the accused cabinet secretaries,

65
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,670
為組建有史以來第一個
making way for the first-ever

66
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,820
全女性內閣鋪平了道路
all-female cabinet in US history.

67
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,300
不是一次  不是兩次
Not one, not two,

68
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,100
而是三次墮胎
but three abortions.

69
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,230
第三次胎兒已經16周了
The third one at 16 weeks.

70
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,640
想想吧
Think about it.

71
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,020
那已經不是幾個細胞
That's not a few cells

72
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,420
或一團組織那么大了
or a collection of cells.

73
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,340
差不多已經有四英寸半大小
It's more like four and a half inches long

74
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,530
3.5盎司[約100克]那么重了
and three and a half ounces.

75
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,800
16周的時候
At 16 weeks,

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,740
總統的胎兒應該已經有
the President's baby would have been the size...

77
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,000
這么大了
of this.

78
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,600
美國同胞們  當前有一些人
My fellow Americans, there are certain parties out there

79
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,670
希望利用我的個人生活攫取政治利益
that hope to use my private life for political gain.

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,710
下面的話  我只說一次
I'm going to say this exactly once.

81
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,380
多年來我和我已故的丈夫一直在嘗試組建家庭
For many years, my late husband and I tried to start a family.

82
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,260
我從前之所以不怎么提這事  是因為
I downplayed that fact in the past because...

83
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,890
這是一個痛苦的話題
Well, it's a painful subject.

84
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,480
當我終于懷孕的時候
When I finally became pregnant,

85
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,940
孩子卻發育不良
the baby wasn't viable,

86
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,540
所以不得不終止妊娠
and the pregnancy had to be terminated.

87
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,820
僅此而已
End of story.

88
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,950
孩子是健康孩子
The baby was viable.

89
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,580
但我和弗蘭西斯  不是好父母
Francis and I, as parents, were not.

90
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,910
我要說清楚
So, let me be clear.

91
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,630
這將是我最后一次談及這個話題
This is the last I will ever say on this subject.

92
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,340
好了
Okay.

93
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,160
今天在座的各位  都讓我非常驕傲
I am so proud of every person around this table.

94
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,370
她們每一個人都服務國家多年
Each of them has served this country

95
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,670
兢兢業業  忠于職守
with honor and distinction.

96
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,860
有些已經位列副部
Some as deputy secretaries.

97
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,590
她們都是美國人中的佼佼者
They are all accomplished Americans

98
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,530
在各自部門和領域中成就卓著
and members of their respective departments.

99
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,830
不過還是由她們介紹自己吧
But I'll let them speak for themselves.

100
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,640
大家好  我是珍妮佛·邦加頓
Hello, my name is Jennifer Baumgarten,

101
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,830
擔任代理聯邦檢察官
and I am the acting Attorney General of the United States.

102
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,630
珍妮會幫我大忙的
Jenny's going to come in very handy.

103
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,010
就司法部而言
And as far as the Justice Department is concerned,

104
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,180
我也認同總統清理門戶的努力
I share the President's commitment to cleaning house.

105
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,790
可是副總統出席所有內閣會議
But isn't it customary for the vice president

106
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,580
不是慣例嗎
to attend all cabinet meetings?

107
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,100
并不是必須出席
Not necessarily, no.

108
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,290
是這樣  自從我加入安德伍德政府
Listen, ever since I joined the Underwood administration,

109
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,750
總統和我始終合作緊密  信任無間
the President and I have worked together on a daily basis.

110
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,510
配合默契  我們就是這樣
Hand in glove. That's the way we work.

111
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,510
你被要求辭職是真的嗎
Is it true that you were asked to resign?

112
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,700
什么  當然沒有
What? No.

113
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,120
沒有
No.

114
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,640
至于我通俄的指控  更是荒唐
And the Russians and me, it's preposterous.

115
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,710
我和總統都同意
Look, the President and I agree

116
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,390
揪出這些不實指控背后主謀的最好辦法
the best way to find out who's behind these accusations

117
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,500
就是任命一位特別檢察官
is to appoint a special prosecutor.

118
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,170
讓他或她依法履職
And let him or her do her job.

119
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,800
-非常感謝  -再問一個問題  一個問題
- Thanks very much. - One more question, one question!

120
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,490
副總統先生  再問一個問題
Mr. Vice President, one question.

121
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,720
再問一個
One more question!

122
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,720
副總統先生
Mr. Vice President!

123
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,390
副總統先生  再問一個  再問一個
Mr. Vice President, one question, one more question!

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,100
好的  好的  謝謝你  很好
Okay. Great. Thank you. Great.

125
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,400
好的  謝謝  謝謝你  再見
Okay, good. Thanks, thanks. Bye.

126
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,610
她找到它了嗎
Did she find him?

127
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,980
湯姆
Tom.

128
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,150
-她找到它了嗎  -沒有
- Did she find him? - No.

129
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,820
前門開著
Front door was open.

130
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,930
狗不見了  屋里也沒人
Dog's not there. No one was there.

131
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,550
湯姆  我太抱歉了  我感覺沒別的辦法了
Okay, Tom, I am so sorry. I felt like I had no other option.

132
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,930
我發誓
I mean, I swear,

133
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,710
-我真的看見你房子里有人  -我知道
- I saw someone inside your... - No, I know. I know.

134
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,940
要不我們再回去找找  可是
We can go circle back and take another look if you want, but...

135
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,710
這不是個好主意
That doesn't sound like a good idea.

136
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,180
你的傳真
That's your fax.

137
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,680
很好
Great.

138
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,780
多少錢
How much is that?

139
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,060
首張一塊九  續張每張一塊二毛五
$1.90 for the first page, $1.25 for each additional.

140
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,370
看起來你續張可不少呢
And it looks like you've got quite a few additionals coming in.

141
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,330
我能不能...
But can I just...

142
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,580
讓我算算一共要花多少錢
Let me just figure out how much it's gonna cost.

143
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,630
這些錢足夠了
That's more than enough.

144
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,730
是啊  謝謝你
Yeah, thank you.

145
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:03,790
給你
Here you go.

146
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,830
-謝謝  -客氣
- Thank you. - You bet.

147
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,460
39.3度
102.7.

148
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,300
你干嗎讓護士走
Why did you send the nurse away?

149
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,260
因為她也得吃飯
Because she needed to eat.

150
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,470
而且我感覺還行
And I feel fine.

151
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,270
-我看你還行才怪  -不不  你看
- I find this anything but fine. - No, no, look...

152
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,910
發燒是好事
This fever's good.

153
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,100
但我覺得不該燒這么久
I don't think it's supposed to last this long.

154
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,770
要我給你換床單嗎
Do you want me to change the sheets?

155
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,700
反正還會濕的
What's the point?

156
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,660
你知道我無論如何都支持你
You know, I support you no matter what.

157
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,250
不管你想嘗試什么療法
Whatever you want to try,

158
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,210
但是這也...
but this is...

159
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,170
研究成果很樂觀
Research is very good.

160
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,710
在歐洲也臨床驗證過了
Proven effective in Europe.

161
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,470
你還記得
Do you remember

162
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,520
老爸總是逼我穿長袖吃晚餐嗎
how dad used to make me wear long sleeves at dinner?

163
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,730
你想他們嗎
Do you miss them?

164
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,400
想媽  不想他
Her, not him.

165
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,950
他總是對是非對錯那么篤定
He was always so sure about what was right.

166
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:10,540
媽媽的疑慮經年累月  反倒讓她更深刻了
Mom's doubt actually allowed her to deepen as time went by.

167
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,370
深刻也沒那么好
Depth is overrated.

168
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,760
明天要不要取消
Do you want to cancel tomorrow?

169
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,760
怎么能取消呢
We can't cancel.

170
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,270
怎么了  安妮
What's wrong, Annie?

171
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,020
安妮
Annie?

172
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,940
我一直打鄧肯的電話
I keep calling Duncan.

173
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,610
他不回話  也不回家
And I've heard nothing, and he still hasn't gone home.

174
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,160
你知道他早晚會發現的
You knew he was gonna find out someday.

175
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,460
也許這樣最好
Maybe it's for the best.

176
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,730
如果您餓了渴了
If you're hungry or thirsty...

177
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,510
我生氣  累  還難過
Angry. Tired. Frustrated.

178
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,490
我現在應該接受詢問了
I should've been debriefed by now.

179
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,080
如果您需要水或者咖啡的話
Again, if you need water or a cup of coffee...

180
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,890
這太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

181
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,680
失陪下
Excuse me.

182
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,640
沒有可見的傷痕
No visible scars.

183
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,710
看來你已經看過醫生了
I assume you've been looked at by a physician.

184
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,210
這是程序
It's protocol.

185
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,380
和局里高層聯絡也是
So is talking with a senior member of the Agency.

186
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,420
今天你是見不著他們了
That won't be happening today.

187
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,390
你基本上  廢了
You're essentially burnt

188
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,390
不管是你和哪個情報局的工作
when it comes to your work with any of the agencies.

189
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,370
是這么說的吧  "廢了"
That's the term, isn't it, burnt?

190
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,500
不非得這么說
Not necessarily.

191
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,230
差不多都這么說
Virtually always.

192
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,080
沒人知道你被監禁期間說了什么  沒說什么
Nobody knows what you said or didn't say while in captivity.

193
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,850
我沒說  克萊爾
I didn't say, Claire.

194
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,440
是總統女士
Madam President.

195
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,700
你聽說馬克的事了嗎
Oh, and have you heard about Mark?

196
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,740
他把自己變成了一出好戲
He's made quite a spectacle of himself.

197
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,350
也許過不了多久  我就不得不發話了
I don't know how much longer I can keep my voice out of it.

198
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,870
我猜他是以為他可以全身而退
I guess he thought he could come out from under it.

199
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,770
是啊  那些最了解我們的人
Yes. Well, the people that know us best,

200
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,710
也最知道怎么傷害我們
know best how to hurt us.

201
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,860
安德伍德總統
President Underwood...

202
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,850
其實我已經改回娘家姓黑爾了
Actually, I've gone back to "Hale."

203
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,990
你錯了  如果你認為我參與了...
You're wrong if you think I have...

204
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,190
你不告訴我實情  就太傻了
You are foolish if you don't tell me what it is.

205
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,740
猜猜我不想再忍受哪種人了  簡
Guess which kind of people I'm done suffering, Jane.

206
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,590
你是來對了
You were wise to come.

207
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,550
我告訴過你了  我也會告訴他們
I told you and I'll tell them.

208
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,510
我不想要這份工作
I don't want the job.

209
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,060
道格  你決定前  務必聽他們說完
Doug, just promise you'll hear them out before you do anything.

210
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,690
而且提醒你一句  比爾現在不跟人握手
And just so you're aware, Bill's not shaking hands at the moment.

211
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,530
道格  給你介紹一下
Doug. May I introduce you?

212
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,090
安奈特和比爾·謝潑德
Annette and Bill Shepherd.

213
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,160
你好
Hello.

214
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,950
你還認得弗萊德·安博格吧
You remember Fred Amburg.

215
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,040
道格  說真的
Doug, for the record,

216
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,060
我很喜歡在療養院和你聊天
I really enjoyed our conversations in the facility.

217
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,080
行了
Come on, man.

218
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,840
條條大路通羅馬
All roads lead to Rome, you know?

219
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,800
安奈特和比爾就是羅馬
And Annette and Bill are Rome.

220
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,380
來請坐吧  斯坦普先生
Come. Sit down, please, Mr. Stamper.

221
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,180
他們正要走
These guys were just leaving.

222
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,010
再會了  謝潑德先生
Well, Mr. Shepherd,

223
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,310
-安奈特  -布雷特
- Annette. - Brett.

224
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,390
回頭再聊  比爾
Talk soon, Bill.

225
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,390
-弗萊德  -安奈特
- Fred. - Annette.

226
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,490
弗蘭克對你評價很高  道格
Frank spoke very highly of you, Doug.

227
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,910
你冷嗎  我可以讓他們把空調關了
You cold? I can have 'em switch off the AC.

228
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,890
這地方太潮了  我的天啊
Humidity in this town, my God,

229
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,560
感覺就像
makes you feel like

230
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,750
住在狗嘴巴里似的  是不是
you're living inside the mouth of a dog, doesn't it?

231
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,180
弗萊德里克·古斯塔夫·安博格
Frederic Gustav Amburg

232
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,090
是我最好的朋友
is my very best friend

233
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,260
認識52年了
over 52 years.

234
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,060
我們換過玻璃球
We've traded marbles,

235
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,930
交易過股票
stocks...

236
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,230
有一次還換過未婚妻
a fiancée once upon a time.

237
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,780
請坐吧  你站在那我都緊張了
Please. You're making me nervous standing there.

238
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,070
老天  別糾結個沒完了
Oh, Jesus Christ. Get over it.

239
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,610
你應該覺得自己命好
You should consider yourself lucky

240
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,990
還有弗萊德在那兒陪你
you had Fred to talk to in there.

241
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,930
你就像是那種找到99.9萬美元卻說
You're like the guy who finds $999,000 and says

242
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,540
"怎么不是100萬呢"的人
"Yeah, but it isn't a million."

243
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,230
布雷特·科爾將成為議長
Brett Cole will be the speaker.

244
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,360
如果不算馬克  他就是下一個總統繼任者
Next in line, if you don't count Mark.

245
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,970
我們得把那女人趕下臺
We've gotta get this woman outta there!

246
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,860
斯坦普先生  只要說到關于總統的話題
Mr. Stamper, my brother gets a little impatient

247
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,430
我哥哥就會比較急躁
when it comes to the President.

248
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,890
我們知道她是我們的共同敵人
We know we share a common enemy in her.

249
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,110
他留給你的東西肯定很有破壞力
Whatever he left you must be damning.

250
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,740
這我們還是知道的
We know that much.

251
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,510
弗蘭克知道  除了他就只有你
Frank knew you were the only other man

252
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,620
知道他妻子有多大的本事
who truly knew what his wife was capable of.

253
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,040
你是他唯一相信
The only one he could trust

254
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,810
能在時機到來時做正確的事的人
to do the right thing when the time came.

255
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,630
除非弗蘭克看錯了你
Unless, Frank was wrong about you.

256
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,260
一把拆信刀
A letter opener.

257
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,550
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

258
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,890
你們怎么看到遺囑的
How did you get your hands on the will?

259
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,640
這就叫人脈
It's called reach.

260
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,890
問題在于
You see, the thing is,

261
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
把她拉下臺的東西
whatever brings her down,

262
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,020
也會毀掉弗蘭西斯
could bring Francis down, as well.

263
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,360
你給我聽著
Now you listen to me.

264
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,630
弗蘭克是個能人
Frank was a hell of a guy.

265
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,300
我們本來要一起成就一番事業
We were going to accomplish great things together.

266
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,220
但此事關乎國家未來  太過重大
But this is too damn important for the future of this country.

267
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,990
一個包括你的未來
A future that includes you.

268
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,910
過去的就讓他過去吧
The past is just that.

269
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,390
等等
Hold on a second.

270
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,310
你是給妹妹還是哥哥干活
Do you work for the brother or the sister?

271
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,900
給他們家族
The family.

272
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,150
她不怎么喜歡你
She's not that fond of you.

273
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,220
我想讓你知道的
I wanted you to know.

274
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,120
什么  我其實一直在為他們效力嗎
What? That I was working for them all along?

275
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,870
不管怎么說  是弗蘭西斯給了我們這工作
One way or another, Francis got both of us hired.

276
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,590
我們也知道你和湯姆·哈默施密特的見面
We know you've been meeting with Tom Hammerschmidt.

277
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,340
你最近最好還是離他遠點
You need to stay away from him for a while.

278
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,680
天啊  這電梯怎么這么慢
God, this thing takes forever.

279
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,770
我什么都沒做錯
I have done nothing wrong.

280
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,290
我告訴你  我要揭露她
And I'll tell you something, I am going to expose her.

281
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,440
那自己也會受牽連
And yourself.

282
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,210
那時你該怎么辦
And then where will you be?

283
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,540
-你腦子不清楚了  馬克  -你這是怎么了
- You're not thinking, Mark. - What happened?

284
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,290
她拿住你了嗎
Did she get to you?

285
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,880
你被她要挾住了  是這樣嗎
She got to you, is that what you're saying?

286
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,760
我只是說她那雙藍眼睛里的神色變了
I'm saying something's changed in those steely blue eyes of hers.

287
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
抽身吧
Walk away.

288
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,840
我強烈建議你立即從這一團亂中抽身
My recommendation is walk away from this shit show.

289
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,240
不  我不能走
No. I'm not doing that.

290
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,870
你當初都不想要這個職位
You never even wanted this.

291
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,790
如今卻要為了它戰斗至死嗎
And now you're willing to fight to the death for it?

292
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,460
誰說要"至死"了
Who said anything about "the death?"

293
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,920
去她的  簡
Fuck her, Jane.

294
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,220
操
Fuck!

295
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,430
去她的
Fuck her.

296
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,400
請原諒
Forgive me,

297
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,190
但你為什么總是看不準時機
but why is your timing always off?

298
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,570
我還想幫你脫身
I tried to get you out.

299
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,570
脫身
Out.

300
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,540
多么奇怪的概念啊
What a quaint concept.

301
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,460
想要脫身  當初就不應該卷進來
When the only way out was never to get in in the first place.

302
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,550
我發過誓  我發過誓的
I swore. I swore.

303
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,130
我曾發誓永遠不會再進這座房子了
I swore I would never set foot in this house again.

304
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,390
你為什么要來這里
What the hell are you doing here?

305
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,850
局面已經很糟了  馬克
The optics are awful, Mark.

306
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,230
真的很糟
I mean, really.

307
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,110
只有在這里  我才覺得安心
It's the only place I feel safe.

308
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,370
風景很美  她選那里我也能理解
That looks lovely. I don't blame her for choosing it.

309
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,260
那種偏綠的藍色
And that blue-green color,

310
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,120
一看就是法國阿爾卑斯山的顏色
it's so specific to the French Alps.

311
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,540
天藍色  沒錯  天藍色
Azure, yes, azure.

312
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,480
當然了  咱們的關稅協議
Well, of course our little tariff agreement

313
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,880
確實引起了一些恐慌  維克多
caused some consternation, Viktor,

314
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,390
但我并不后悔  你也不后悔吧
but I don't regret it. Tell me you don't, either.

315
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,640
現在嗎
Right now?

316
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,020
也沒在干什么
Nothing, really.

317
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,400
就是籌劃未來
Just planning for the future.

318
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,190
舊的不去...
Out with the old.

319
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,220
是
Yeah.

320
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,530
三天前誰他媽知道珍妮佛·邦加頓是哪號人物
And exactly who the fuck was Jennifer Baumgarten 72 hours ago?

321
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,000
因為我要你爭取特別檢察官
Because I want you to push for a special prosecutor.

322
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,540
或者  那聽證會也行
Or... Well, hearings then.

323
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,060
因為你要是敢...
Because it will if you...

324
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,050
米切  少糊弄我
Mitch, don't give me that.

325
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,260
你敢做就能行
It will if you do.

326
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,110
因為我在共和黨的年資
Because I was a Republican a lot longer

327
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,930
可比在民主黨長多了  你知道
than I was a Democrat. You know it.

328
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,990
-聽著  米切  -再考慮到剛曝光的
- Listen to me, Mitch... - Considering the latest revelations

329
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,910
副總統的新案情  任誰也不能否認了
regarding the vice president, there's no denying it.

330
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,790
這些指控非常嚴重  決不能應付了事
These are serious allegations that cannot be ignored.

331
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,330
而我有種感覺  這只是冰山一角而已
And something tells me this is just the tip of the iceberg.

332
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,250
他們的關系到底有多深
I mean, how deep does this go?

333
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,960
-什么  我回頭打給你  -又有什么企圖
- What? I'll call you back. - And to what end?

334
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,240
-我們有權知道  -因為我得回頭打給你
- We deserve to know. Look... - 'Cause I need to call you back.

335
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,320
人們一直想給我貼一個政黨立場
People want to associate me with one party or another.

336
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,430
但在價值觀  生活方式上
I'm simply an American when it comes to values,

337
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,470
我只是個普通美國人
way of life.

338
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,680
斯圖爾特小姐和湯姆·耶茨
You have Ms. Stewart meeting with Tom Yates

339
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,140
在副總統家里幽會
in the vice president's home.

340
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,480
而這個湯姆·耶茨  如今也被爆出
Tom Yates, who we now know

341
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,290
是俄羅斯非常感興趣的人
was someone the Russians were very interested in.

342
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,520
而現在  這個副總統
And now you have the vice president

343
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,490
又縮在他的安全屋里
holed up in that safe house,

344
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,650
向我們保證一切都...
assuring us that everything is...

345
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,590
所有媒體都在要求評論
Every news outlet is asking for comment.

346
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,700
哪怕你不是天才  也能想明白
It doesn't take a genius to realize...

347
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,910
有的人就是想看別人跌跟頭  太可鄙了
It's terrible how people live to see others fail.

348
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,410
我已經很難繼續在白宮擔任任何職務了
It's going to be hard for me to continue here in any capacity.

349
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,400
正相反  凱爾茜
On the contrary, Kelsey,

350
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,270
我要任命你為我的正式新聞發言人
I am naming you my permanent press secretary.

351
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,250
-女士  我不...  -下次我見記者時
- Ma'am, I ca... I... - I'm going to announce it

352
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,150
就會宣布任命
the next time I take questions.

353
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,760
至于現在這段時間
For the time being, though,

354
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,490
我想還是由我親自來開例行新聞發布會吧
I think I should handle the daily press briefings.

355
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,470
我想我也該多露露面了
I feel like I need to give them a little face time.

356
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,890
您不明白  我不能...
You don't understand, I can't...

357
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,370
需要你開口的時候  我會告訴你
I will let you know when you need to speak.

358
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,920
別擔心  我們一起挺過去
Don't worry. We'll get through this together.

359
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,090
我今天在衣柜里看見了這個
Listen, I saw this in my closet today.

360
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,470
我就想到了你
And I thought of you.

361
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,630
我希望你收著
I want you to have it.

362
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,070
湯姆本來想搬回紐約
Tom was looking to move back to New York.

363
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,700
我們可以喝喝咖啡  偶爾共進晚餐
We would have coffee, the occasional dinner.

364
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,240
他告訴我他認識了一個人
He told me he was involved with somebody

365
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,580
讓他深陷其中
he couldn't get away from.

366
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,540
這讓他煎熬至極
That it was killing him.

367
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,090
真讓人不忍去想
I can't think about it.

368
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,500
我也不會去想
I won't think about it.

369
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,970
凱爾茜該怎么處理呢
What to do about Kelsey?

370
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,260
你瞧瞧那張臉
I mean, look at that face.

371
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,930
希望你喜歡那包
Enjoy the bag.

372
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,670
梅樂蒂·科魯茲的評論節目
So what Melody Cruz just said on the air,

373
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,440
我猜是你兒子搞的鬼吧
that was your son, I'm guessing.

374
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,360
你得和他談談  不然我去找他
You need to talk to him or I will.

375
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,950
-你小點聲  比爾在休息  -鄧肯在哪
- Keep your voice down. Bill's resting. - Where is Duncan?

376
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,800
-不在這  -比爾  比爾·謝潑德
- Not here. - Bill. Bill Shepard.

377
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,830
他今天不會見你的
Won't be seeing you today.

378
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,670
你還擦這個呢
Still wearing it?

379
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,260
你為什么由著他們搞臭我
Why are you allowing me to be gutted?

380
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,840
-搞臭  -沒錯  搞臭
- Gutted? - Yes, gutted.

381
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,760
搞臭  搞臭
Gutted, gutted.

382
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,180
是我讓梅樂蒂·科魯茲發的評論
I told Melody Cruz to run the piece.

383
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,680
我一直對你忠心耿耿
I have been nothing but loyal to you.

384
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,460
新聞發言人去了你家
The press secretary was in your house

385
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,330
-和湯姆·耶茨偷情  -天啊  得了吧
- with Tom Yates. - Oh, my God. Come on.

386
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,090
哪怕這里面毫無事實可言
Even if there isn't an ounce of truth to it.

387
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,070
馬克  這出通俄丑聞核心就是你
Mark, you're the face of this whole Russia fiasco.

388
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,160
這對國家不利
It's bad for the country.

389
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,120
對比爾和我也沒好處
It's bad for Bill and me.

390
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,290
你需要盡快處理掉
You need to get rid of it.

391
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,170
需要的話把房子燒了也行
Burn your house down, if you have to.

392
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,090
處理掉一切你和丑聞有關的證據
Anything that connects you to the story

393
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,920
然后控制一下情緒
and get a hold of yourself.

394
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,870
局里對關于馬克·厄舍案的最新線索
How's the Bureau feeling about the latest revelations

395
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,760
有什么看法
when it comes to Mark Usher?

396
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,700
不容易查  因為所有證據
It's difficult when all the evidence

397
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,690
都是從俄情報部門來的
is coming from Russian intelligence.

398
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,520
但我們必須得追查所有線索
But we have to follow every lead.

399
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,750
說實話  女士
To be honest, ma'am,

400
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,400
副總統在首都圈里人緣很好
the vice president is well-liked around town.

401
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,660
是  但這畢竟是嚴重罪行  納森
Yes, but we're talking about very serious crimes here, Nathan.

402
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,280
是  女士
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,580
告訴我  道格知道你在監聽后
So, tell me, once Doug knew you were listening in...

404
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,750
他最近基本都在公開行動
He's been operating pretty much in plain sight.

405
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,630
他還想和湯姆·哈默施密特見面
He tried to meet with Tom Hammerschmidt.

406
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,170
又要見
Again?

407
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,640
他去海亞當斯酒店見了比爾和安奈特·謝潑德
And he met with Bill and Annette Shepherd at the Hay-Adams.

408
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,510
此外他回住所時還帶了一條狗
Also, he returned to his apartment with a canine.

409
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,680
道格養了條狗
Doug has a dog?

410
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,310
他的公寓里有一只
There's one in his apartment.

411
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,370
另外我還注意到一件事
Another thing that caught my attention

412
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,870
就是我們派去監視
was the two men we have following

413
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,920
治療道格的心理醫生的兩個人聯系了我
Doug's psychiatrist from the facility contacted me.

414
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,780
說羅森醫生似乎被嚇壞了
Seems Dr. Rosen was pretty shaken up.

415
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,240
他說他摔倒在地  還昏過去了
He said he blacked out and fell down.

416
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,010
但我覺得根本說不通
But I mean, it doesn't make any sense...

417
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,890
-你太心不在焉了  納森  -什么
- You sound very distracted, Nathan. - Excuse me?

418
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,180
我不知道是因為你得起夜照顧孩子
I don't know if it's the lack of sleep

419
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,470
導致的睡眠不足
because of the night feedings,

420
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,060
但我不禁在想  你還能不能做好
but I wonder if you're still capable of doing the job

421
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,580
我交給你的工作
that I expect of you.

422
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,770
我向您保證  女士
I promise you, ma'am,

423
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,670
我完全能夠履行職務
I'm fully capable of executing my duties.

424
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,340
男孩還是女孩
Boy or girl?

425
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,240
-男孩  -我真為你們高興  納森
- A boy. - I'm so happy for you, Nathan.

426
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,390
俗話都說二婚最幸福
They do say second marriages are the best.

427
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,790
幾點了
What time is it?

428
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,500
別管時間了
Don't worry about it.

429
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,580
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

430
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,520
我給你量量體溫吧
Can I check your temperature?

431
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,590
不要
No.

432
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,400
每次我一醒過來
Every time I wake up,

433
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,720
你們就對我摸來戳去的
you people put your hands all over me.

434
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,220
我上床的時候53歲
When I went to bed, I was 53 years old.

435
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,930
現在都不知道自己多老了
I don't know how old I am.

436
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,250
馬克來過了嗎
Was Mark here?

437
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,210
我聽見他聲音了  我一直迷迷糊糊的
I heard these voices, I was going in and out.

438
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,750
-賽斯  -比爾
- Seth! - Bill,

439
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,530
-你還是回房間吧  -不  我還沒死
- maybe you should go back to your room. - No, I'm not dead yet.

440
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,030
他來過了嗎
Was he here?

441
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,470
-來過  但是  -斯克斯基女士找到了嗎
- Yes, but... - Okay. Well, where is Ms. Skorsky?

442
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,930
我們派了人在找了
We have people looking for her.

443
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,180
我們能確定她還在華盛頓
We're fairly sure she's still in the DC area.

444
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,460
但她手里有什么
But what does she have?

445
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,440
我們知道雷·麥耶斯
We now know that Ray Meyers

446
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,150
向這里的一家打印店
was faxing some kind of document

447
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,300
傳真了一些文件
to a copy shop here in the city.

448
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,300
那個道格·斯坦普有什么回信嗎
And anything from your Doug Stamper?

449
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,030
還沒  先生
No, sir.

450
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,600
比爾  求你了  你還在發燒
Bill, please, you're still feverish.

451
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,310
你能稍等下嗎
Can you give us a minute?

452
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,350
當然
Of course.

453
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,530
它在哪
Where is he?

454
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,570
它很安全
He's safe.

455
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,370
你可就未必了
Which is more than I can say for you.

456
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,560
知道嗎  有時候我都分不清你是在威脅我
You know, at times I can't tell if you're making a threat

457
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,870
還是想幫忙
or offering help.

458
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,250
賽斯·格雷森為什么要找簡寧·斯克斯基
Why is Seth Grayson looking for Janine Skorsky?

459
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,150
我想那些
I'm assuming the men

460
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,460
把你家翻得底朝天的人想找的就是她
who turned your place upside down were looking for her.

461
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,380
她在寫一篇報道
She's working on an article.

462
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,260
但她必須得另找一家報紙發表
But she'll have to find someplace else to publish.

463
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,060
她所在的報社被謝潑德家買下了
Her newspaper was bought by the Shepherds.

464
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,770
我們需要再見一面  湯姆
We still need to meet, Tom.

465
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,310
是
Yeah.

466
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,270
還有  道格
And, Doug,

467
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,000
你要是敢傷那小家伙一根毛
you lay a hand on that innocent animal,

468
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,900
我對天發誓  我把你腸子打出來
and I swear to Christ, I'll beat the living shit out of you.

469
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,490
你的狗沒事
Your dog's fine.

470
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,580
賽斯
Seth?

471
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,600
我知道你很尊敬我哥哥
I know you look up to my brother.

472
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,270
而且你也很周到
And you've been very attentive.

473
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,100
但他身體不太好
But he's not well, okay?

474
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,020
所以從此刻起
And from this moment on,

475
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,030
任何你認為需要向他匯報的消息
any information you think he needs,

476
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,200
都要先經過我
I need to hear it first.

477
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,610
我明白
I understand.

478
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,120
他會恢復的
He will recover.

479
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,000
謝謝你這么說
Thank you for saying that.

480
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,920
道格·斯坦普不喜歡被人呼來喝去
Doug Stamper doesn't like to be told what to do.

481
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,880
只有讓他覺得是他自己的點子才行
It only works if he thinks it's his idea.

482
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,130
話說
Listen,

483
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,570
也許不關我事
it may be none of my business,

484
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,220
但自從鄧肯收到了一個白宮寄來的包裹
but I haven't been able to reach Duncan

485
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,580
我就再也聯系不到他了
since he received a package from the White House.

486
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,060
我不知道包裹里是什么
I don't know what it was.

487
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,770
但他非常難過
But he was very upset.

488
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,150
謝謝
Thank you.

489
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,780
你說得對
You're right.

490
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,570
確實不關你事
That's none of your business.

491
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,640
我極力說服他  相信我
I urged him. Believe me.

492
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,020
我勸他自己辭職
I urged him to resign,

493
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,050
但他至多也就一半時間聽我的
but he listens to me half the time, at best.

494
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,880
我需要你理解
I need you to understand.

495
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,600
我不想再傷害馬克了
I don't want to hurt Mark again.

496
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,170
曾經有個迷茫的年輕女孩
There was a troubled young woman...

497
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,760
為什么好多故事的開頭都是這句話呢
I wonder why so many stories have to begin that way.

498
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,870
我知道  我也不喜歡這個故事
I know. I know. I hate this story.

499
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,700
我也不想告訴你
I hate that I'm telling you.

500
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,210
犧牲品女孩的故事我也講膩了
I'm tired of the disposable girl story.

501
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,560
布雷特·科爾第一次競選時她來做志工
She started as a volunteer on Brett Cole's first campaign.

502
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,290
馬克和我是顧問
Mark and I were consulting.

503
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,820
布雷特的妻子那時都快臨盆了
Brett's wife was as pregnant as could be.

504
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,050
而這個迷茫的姑娘卻非要纏著他不放
And the troubled young woman wouldn't leave him alone.

505
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,890
至少布雷特是這么說的
Well, that's how Brett characterized it.

506
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,600
他有沒有試圖吸引她
Did he encourage her attention?

507
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,850
享受她的迷戀
Enjoy it?

508
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,770
那是自然的
You bet he did.

509
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,520
他是個男人  有男人的自大
He's a man with a man's ego.

510
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,800
總之最后出了大亂子
Anyway, of course it became a mess

511
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,300
就像這類故事一慣的那樣
in all the ways these stories do.

512
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,160
于是收拾局面就成了馬克的任務
And suddenly, it was Mark's job to clean it up.

513
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,160
他逼她逼得太緊
He leaned on her too hard.

514
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,460
糾纏她  羞辱她
Badgered and berated her.

515
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,500
"你要毀了布雷特的未來
"You're ruining Brett's future.

516
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,670
你就該消失"
You better disappear."

517
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,590
于是她就消失了
And so she did.

518
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,810
她從羅斯福大橋上跳下去了
She jumped off the Roosevelt Bridge.

519
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,440
這事把馬克徹底嚇壞了  克萊爾
It fucked with Mark's head, Claire.

520
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,820
從此他就嚇破了膽  他
He lost his nerve after that. He...

521
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,190
他開始對一切都充滿懷疑
He started to question everything.

522
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,570
一切
Everything.

523
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,820
一切
Everything.

524
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,930
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

525
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:00,250
我不該這樣的
I'm... I mean, this is not me.

526
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,830
簡
Jane.

527
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,050
你知道你是在救他吧
You're saving him, you know that, right?

528
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,010
實話告訴我吧
Now, tell me the truth.

529
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,510
是你幫助凱茜逃跑的嗎
Did you help Cathy get away?

530
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,250
俄羅斯聯邦安全局可幫了大忙
The FSB have been very helpful, so you know.

531
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,650
他們很快就要找到凱茜了
They're very close to locating Cathy.

532
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,010
我注意到你每次要撒謊的時候
I've noticed that you always adjust your hair

533
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,660
總會撩一撩頭發
right before you tell a lie.

534
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,830
我想告訴你  我原諒你了
I want you to know I forgive you.

535
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,590
她想彈劾我
She wants to try and impeach me?

536
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,400
好啊  來啊  我等著呢
Be my guest, I cannot wait.

537
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,590
他們恨她  跟你說
They hate her, you know.

538
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,840
眾議院  所有參議員  恨死她了
The House, all the Senators, they hate her guts.

539
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,160
等到事情結束  她就會求我...
By the time this thing is over, she'll be begging me to...

540
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,930
別這么做
Don't do this.

541
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,390
我為了這個沒良心的女人做了這么多...
Everything I've done for that ungrateful...

542
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,350
別讓這種事再次發生
Don't let this happen again.

543
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,980
我沒能照顧好你
I didn't take proper care of you.

544
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,280
作為朋友
As a friend.

而尼克松被自己的過去困住

他的尸體還在我手上
I am still in possession of his body,

有必要的話我會用的
and I'll use it, if I have to.

你沒必要操心這些事

這種困難簡寧應付得了

你到底殺沒殺瑞秋
Did you kill Rachel?

584
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,980
我需要聽你親口說
I need to hear you say it.

585
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,270
你自己也需要說
You need it for yourself.

586
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,150
是我殺的
I did.

587
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,150
但你找不到她的
But you won't find her.

588
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,530
沒人能找得到
No one will.

589
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,070
自首吧
Turn yourself in.

590
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,740
我跟你一起去
Take me.

591
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,290
然后把你埋她的方向指給我
Point me in the direction where you left her.

592
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,250
還有人關心過她呢
There are people who cared for her.

593
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,590
我也關心過她
I cared for her.

594
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,940
佐伊是弗蘭西斯殺的嗎
Did Francis kill Zoe?

595
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,740
告訴我是不是弗蘭西斯殺了佐伊
Tell me if Francis killed Zoe.

596
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,570
現在還是私下說嗎
Is this still off the record?

597
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,540
你知道真相就滿足了嗎
Will it be enough for you to know the truth?

598
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,870
因為你永遠無法證明
Because you're never gonna be able to prove it.

599
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,790
湯姆  你必須滿足  不然我立馬就走
Tom, it has to be enough, or I walk away.

600
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:02,800
-不  必須有人負責  -天啊  他都死了
- No. Someone has to answer... - Jesus Christ, he's dead.

601
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,880
但是她
But her...

602
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,070
你自己也說過  她和他一樣有罪
You said it yourself, she's as guilty as he is.

603
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,100
要我說甚至她罪更重
I'm saying, maybe more.

604
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,330
也許他這么做都是為了她
Maybe he did it all for her.

605
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,230
你知道什么
What d'you got?

606
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,100
我們達成協議了嗎
Do we have an agreement?

607
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,840
我告訴你真相  你別把他牽涉進來
I give you the truth, and you leave him out of it.

608
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,070
我做不到
I can't do that.

609
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,200
這個世界本就不公平  湯姆
It's not a just world, Tom.

610
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,180
但有時你會有機會讓有罪之人受到懲罰
But sometimes you have the chance to make the right person pay,

611
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,000
哪怕罪名對不上
even if it's for the wrong crime.

612
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,460
難道你還不滿足嗎
Is that enough for you?

613
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,570
因為如果是這樣  那我尊重你的想法
Because if it's not, I respect you,

614
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,650
但我們就此別過
and we can say goodbye.

615
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,900
-不行  道格  我無法滿足  -湯姆
- No, Doug. It's not enough for me. - Tom.

616
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,260
-而且我也絕不同意  -湯姆
- And I do not agree! - Tom.

617
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,430
我永遠不會告訴你
I am never going to tell you

618
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,470
就是弗蘭西斯殺了這三個人
that Francis killed the three of them,

619
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,010
佐伊  羅素
Zoe, Russo

620
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,930
還有莉安
and LeAnn.

621
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,940
但你已經知道真相了
But you already know the truth.

622
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,520
是
Yes.

623
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,820
我確實知道
Yes, I do.

624
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,910
開始記錄
On the record.

625
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,210
從現在開始
From here.

626
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,460
她做了什么
What did she do?

627
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,590
斯克斯基女士
Ms. Skorsky.

628
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,740
聯邦檢察官網絡專案組的人很快就到了
Members of the US Attorney Cyber Task Force are on their way.

629
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,570
我這是在給你機會
I'm giving you a chance.

630
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:32,050
那我也給你個機會公開回應下吧
And I'm giving you a chance to go on the record.

631
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:38,620
任何阿卡斯精煉廠或謝潑德無限責任公司旗下
Emails or any correspondence written while at Arcas Refinery

632
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,750
子公司所發出的電郵或其他通信
or any subsidiary of Shepherd Unlimited

633
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,580
均為比爾和安奈特·謝潑德的專有財產
are the sole property of Bill and Annette Shepherd.

634
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,090
那么比爾和安奈特·謝潑德是否知曉
Were Bill and Annette Shepherd aware of the possibility

635
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,320
阿卡斯廠的工人存在死亡的可能
that workers might die at the Arcas plant?

636
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,910
別拿這玩意指著我
Get that outta my face.

637
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,240
我們知道雷·麥耶斯給你發了什么
We know what Ray Meyers sent you.

638
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,450
你有沒有利用阿卡斯泄漏事件
Did you use the Arcas accident

639
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,190
慫恿貝爾波特居民注冊一款應用
to get the citizens of Bellport to sign up for this app?

640
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,480
你協助謝潑德自由基金
An app that you helped develop

641
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,920
開發出來的應用
for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation?

642
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,090
斯克斯基女士
Ms. Skorsky,

643
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:11,400
他們會沒收你的電腦和其他設備的
they're about to confiscate your computer and any devices.

644
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,800
你現在就可以拿走
You can take it right now.

645
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,270
你什么都不會找到的
You're not gonna find anything here.

646
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,810
我知道你要來  格雷森先生
I knew you were coming, Mr. Grayson.

647
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,400
道格
Doug.

648
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,240
我可以去見總統了
I'm ready to see the President.

649
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,810
按說一個人應該始終如一
You expect a person to be true to his character.

650
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:43,690
你是那么小心謹慎
You're so careful.

651
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,690
那么擅長清理自己留下的亂子
You're so good about cleaning up after yourself.

652
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,380
為什么沒有處理掉他呢
Why didn't you just get rid of him?

653
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,430
弗蘭西斯另有想法
Well, Francis wanted it otherwise.

654
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,220
我真希望你的答案能讓我意外
I was so hoping you'd surprise me.

655
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,680
你打算怎么做  馬克
What are you gonna do, Mark?

656
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,580
難道你要拉出尸體
You gonna pull out the body,

657
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,940
放到墓碑上展示嗎
drape it over the tombstone?

658
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,210
胡蔓藤可是俄羅斯情報部門常用的毒藥
Gelsemium is known to be used by Russian intelligence.

659
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,710
我要你離開我家
I want you out of my house.

660
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:13,280
但據我所知  你本來就是一個殺人犯
But from what I understand, you're pretty much a murderer anyway.

661
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,700
你一般不犯錯誤  是不是
You don't normally make mistakes, do you?

662
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,580
但只要犯錯
But when you do,

663
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,580
就犯個大錯
they are something.

664
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,060
難道你內心里就沒希望
Was there some hope in you that

665
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,230
那個迷茫的姑娘會自我了結嗎
the troubled young woman would do herself in?

666
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,900
這樣科爾議員就能解脫了
That Congressman Cole would be relieved somehow.

667
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,090
我要求你立即離開我家  克萊爾
I'd like you to get out of my house, Claire.

668
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:40,310
你必須要井井有條  毫不留情
It's important to be organized and ruthless.

669
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,390
我一直說事物要分成三種
Three piles, I always say.

670
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,140
你想留著的
The stuff you wanna keep.

671
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,400
先存起來以備后用的
The stuff you might need later that you put in storage.

672
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,820
以及那些必須毀掉的
And the stuff you have to destroy.

673
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,370
-簡  是我  -太對不起了
- Jane, it's me. - I'm so sorry.

674
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,790
我不介意你告訴她了
I don't care that you told her.

675
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,880
你聽見了嗎  我真的不在乎
You hear me? I don't care.

676
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,840
我的偏頭痛
I have the worst migraine

677
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,050
簡直要疼死了
of my life.

678
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,550
簡
Jane.

679
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,850
簡  你還好嗎
Jane, are you okay?

680
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,650
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

681
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,650
簡
Jane.

682
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,790
我差點忘了  還有第四種呢
I almost forgot. There's always a fourth pile.

683
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,290
那些你不知道該怎么處理的
The stuff you don't know what to do with.

684
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,460
您要喝點水嗎
Can I get you some water?

685
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,300
或者別的什么更烈的
Something stronger, maybe?

686
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,220
不了  謝謝  你自己隨意
No, thank you. But don't let me stop you.

687
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,890
我每年的勞工節都要禁一個月的酒
I take a month off drinking, come every Labor Day.

688
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,370
算是某種校歷儀式吧
Kind of an academic calendar ritual

689
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,020
向自己證明我并不酗酒
to prove to myself I'm not actually an alcoholic.

690
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:12,730
其實我也在節制
I'm actually abstaining myself, at the moment.

691
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,030
是為了
For pursuit of...

692
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,820
看得更清楚吧
clarity, I guess.

693
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,280
想坐坐嗎
Would you like to sit down?

694
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,950
好的
Sure.

695
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,050
他瘋了
He's crazy.

696
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,880
這是有醫生證明的  你知道吧
Certifiable. You know that, right?

697
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,010
道格僅僅一個半月之前
Doug got out of a psychiatric facility

698
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,990
才從精神病院出來
all of a month and a half ago.

699
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,950
無論他多么努力地想復活自己的政治生涯
And no matter how hard he tries to revive his political career

700
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,440
想重新下場
or get back in the game...

701
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,150
他都是個腦筋錯亂的騙子
He's a delusional liar.

702
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,150
而且實話告訴你
And to tell you the truth,

703
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,530
沒準他和弗蘭西斯更般配呢
maybe he was a better wife to Francis.

704
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:04,160
所以他根本無法清楚地認知事物
Which is why he was never able to see things clearly.

705
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,370
他到底跟你說什么了  湯姆
I mean, what did he tell you, Tom?

706
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,750
你覺得他告訴我什么你不想讓我知道的事了
What do you think he told me that you don't want me to know?

707
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:16,550
天啊  他肯定跟你說了很多瘋狂臆想
Boy. The fantasies he must have reported to you.

708
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,380
你不得不可憐他
You need to pity him.

709
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,570
真的  我就可憐他
You really do. I do.

710
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,860
總統女士  您這樣擅自闖入
Madam President, this type of intrusion

711
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,200
-公民的私人住所  -聽著  我無法否認
- into a civilian's home... - Listen, there's no denying

712
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,000
弗蘭西斯是個不擇手段的人  做了
that Francis was a desperate man who did,

713
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,560
沒錯  做了許多不擇手段的事
yes, a lot of desperate things.

714
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,980
我不知道  也許到了最后
And I don't know. Maybe towards the end,

715
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,440
他都有點精神錯亂了
he was slightly deranged.

716
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,450
但不管他做了什么  都是他自己做的
But whatever he did, he did alone.

717
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,990
我都沒有參與
I was not complicit.

718
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,290
而且你  還記得最后一次
And do you... Do you remember the last interview

719
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,330
采訪我丈夫的時候嗎
you did with my husband?

720
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,520
在談話的最后  他問你
And the conversation ended where he asked you

721
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,630
你信不信他的話
if you'd believed what he'd told you.

722
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,090
你還記得你怎么回答的嗎
Do you remember how you responded, Tom?

723
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,050
我記得
I do.

724
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,430
我說  一點都不信
I said, "Not for a second."

725
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,230
總統女士
Madam President,

726
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,860
關于你是否是共犯的問題
when it comes to your complicity,

727
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,160
我想我們最好還是在正式場合談一談
I think it's best if we meet under more formal circumstances.

728
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,700
我會給你的新聞辦公室發一份問題清單
I'll be sending over a list of questions to your press office.

729
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,390
你可以通過書信或電郵來回答
You can answer them by mail, email.

730
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,500
如果你愿意的話  當面錄音采訪也行
Or if you prefer, face-to-face and on the record.

731
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,950
她給你掃房子掃了多少年
How many years did she clean up after you?

732
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,450
我的母親  你的管家
My mother, the housekeeper.

733
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,040
從我看見你的那一刻  鄧肯
From the second I saw you, Duncan.

734
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,170
你那漂亮的  皺成一團的小臉
Your beautiful little scrunched up face.

735
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,090
跟小老頭一樣
Like an old man.

736
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,180
那一刻我就知道了
I just knew. It was instant.

737
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,590
我們是一家人
We just belonged,

738
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,770
是一家人  真的
we belonged, we did.

739
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,270
那你為什么沒有合法收養我
Why didn't you legally adopt me?

740
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,820
我想大概是因為沒必要吧
I guess, because I didn't have to.

741
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,650
我父親呢
And my father?

742
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,490
是不是...
Was it...

743
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,950
不是不是
Oh, no, no, no.

744
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,290
一夜情而已
A one night stand.

745
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,210
她
She...

746
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,340
她說她沒記住他的名字
said she didn't remember his name.

747
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,520
我去看她了
I went to see her.

748
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,640
我的生母
My birth mother.

749
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:20,900
她的住處離這里不到半小時的車程
She lives not more than half an hour from here.

750
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,230
這你知道嗎
Did you know that?

751
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,190
你和她說話了嗎
Did you talk to her?

752
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:26,400
我沒敢
Couldn't.

753
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,110
我不能那么對她
I couldn't do that to her.

754
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,620
我只是
I just...

755
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,040
我只是遠遠看著她
I just watched her.

756
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,170
她怎么能把我...
How could she let...

757
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,440
我知道我能照顧好你
I knew I could take care of you.

758
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,130
我也知道她照顧不好你
I knew she couldn't.

759
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,590
就算你現在不想
If not now,

760
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,260
我也希望你能原諒我
I hope you can forgive me.

761
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,980
你還好嗎  鄧肯
You okay, Duncan?

762
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,810
幫我說說  比爾
Help me, Bill.

763
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,800
你的親生父母是誰  從哪來的
Who your real parents were, where they came from...

764
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,870
我根本就不在乎
I never cared about any of that.

765
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,370
因為
Because...

766
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,540
你知道因為什么
Well, you know why.

767
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:23,420
那就說啊
Say it.

768
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,590
他到底是什么人  比爾
Who he is, Bill.

769
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,670
我受夠了
I don't need this.

770
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,030
你不要走
Stay where you are.

771
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,280
-不  -鄧肯
- No. - Duncan,

772
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,200
如果你和我還想做一家人
if you and I are to have any chance,

773
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,050
那你就不要走
you need to stay right here.

774
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:42,190
比爾  快說啊
Bill, say it.

775
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,520
他對你  對我  到底是什么人
Who he is to you. To me.

776
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:48,750
親愛的
Honey...

777
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,320
他到底是什么人  快說啊你
Who is he, goddamn it?

778
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,080
他不是咱家的人
He's not one of us.

779
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,590
你個孬種
You're a coward.

780
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,800
讓克萊爾·黑爾替你說出來
Letting Claire Hale say it for you.

781
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,220
我希望你快死
Well, I hope you die.

782
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,890
我們走  走吧
Let's go. Now!

783
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,760
電郵鏈接中的會議記錄清楚地表明
The email links to corporate minutes that clearly indicate

784
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,310
公司提前知道
a foreknowledge of hazard

785
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,210
有發生危及生命安全的災難的可能性
that resulted in catastrophic harm and loss of life.

786
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,770
而列席會議并且同意公司政策的
In attendance and party to consent of the corporate policy

787
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:52,010
正是公司總裁威廉·謝潑德
was the entity's chief executive officer William Shepherd.

788
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:56,740
阿卡斯精煉廠負有責任
Arcas Refinery is liable.

789
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,390
謝潑德無限責任公司也一樣
As is Shepherd Unlimited.

790
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,870
公司和比爾·謝潑德本人都可以被指控
The corporation and Bill Shepherd himself can be charged

791
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,020
犯下過失殺人罪
with involuntary manslaughter.

792
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:05,850
把他打成殺人犯
Expose him as a murderer

793
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,360
順便還能讓他損失幾十億
and cost him billions in the process.

794
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,820
斯克斯基女士會發表嗎
Is Ms. Skorsky publishing?

795
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,740
我親自確保的
I made sure of it.

796
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,200
等你逮捕他  故事就更精彩了
It's a better story once you arrest him.

797
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,040
而這篇文章又可以支持逮捕
And the article will justify the arrest.

798
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,410
我們可以請律師來  至少能拖一拖
We can get some lawyers in here and delay, at the very least.

799
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,750
不
No.

800
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,440
那我們可以安排他們從后門帶你走
Then we can make sure they walk you out the back.

801
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,960
不不不
No, no, no.

802
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,380
不行  我想戴手銬
No, no. I want the cuffs.

803
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,070
總統這次太過分了
President's gone too far this time.

804
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:36,840
我想讓全世界都看到
I want the whole world to see.

805
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:39,600
我妹妹呢
And my sister?

806
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,060
你可以在任何地方交給我  為什么在這里
You could've handed me this anywhere, why here?

807
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,440
似乎這里更合適
Seemed appropriate.

808
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,320
你可不是那種懷舊的人  道格
You never struck me as nostalgic, Doug.

809
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,880
難道你還對弗蘭西斯的死后赦免
Could this be about the posthumous pardoning

810
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,470
還有癡心妄想嗎
you've been imagining for Francis?

811
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,990
你不屬于這里
You don't belong here.

812
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,080
我有時候真擔心你胡思亂想
I sometimes worry about your imagination.

813
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,040
你這奴隸一般的忠誠
Your slavish devotion.

814
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,440
你無法去想他之外的事
You can't think beyond him. Not really.

815
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,230
你離開白宮的景象  我倒是想象得很清楚
I can imagine you not in the White House quite clearly.

816
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,800
我的天哪
Oh, my goodness.

817
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,440
你要總是說這樣的話
You keep saying things like that,

818
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,720
我可能就不能放你走了
I might not be able to let you leave.

819
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,440
你怎么處理了
What did you do with it?

820
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,980
他的遺囑
The will.

821
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:33,770
你燒掉了嗎
Did you burn it?

822
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:37,150
他把一切都留給我了
He left me everything.

823
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,610
你知道  我也知道
You know it, and I know it.

824
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,370
不好意思
Excuse me.

825
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,000
最近我困得越來越早了
I get sleepy so early these days.

826
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,760
我不會再聽從誰的命令了  道格
I'm not going to be told what to do anymore, Doug.

827
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:02,550
無論是你  或是別人
Not by you or anyone or any man,

828
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,640
永遠  永遠不會了
ever, ever again.

829
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:06,970
-給  湯姆  -多謝了  丹
- Here, Tom. - Thanks, Dan.

830
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,440
-不客氣  -很快就好
- No problem. - Won't be long.

831
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:09,810
沒關系
Whatever.

832
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:25,910
轉身
Turn.

833
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,450
坐下  坐下
Sit, sit.

834
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:29,160
好孩子  聽著
Good boy, listen.

835
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,730
-趴下  趴到柜臺下面  -好好
- Get down, below the counter. - Okay, okay.

836
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,230
我怎么說你就怎么做  好嗎
You do exactly like I told you before, okay?

837
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,190
記住  這是在玩呢  記住了
Remember, it's all about having fun, remember?

838
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,950
你一定要乖  沒事的
You be a good boy. It's gonna be all right.

839
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,350
好好玩  好嗎  好
Just have fun, okay? Okay.

840
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,760
剛剛收到的消息
And in breaking news just in,

841
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,060
我們沉痛地宣布《華盛頓先驅報》
we are sad to report that one of the Washington Herald's

842
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,350
最優秀的記者和主編  湯姆·哈默施密特
most accomplished journalists and editors Tom Hammerschmidt

843
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,940
在一次搶劫中不幸中槍  當場身亡
was pronounced dead at the scene of a robbery gone terribly wrong.

844
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,360
白宮很快發表了聲明
The White House was quick to comment,

845
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,860
說就在幾小時前
as the President had sat down

846
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,360
總統曾與這位獲獎記者
with the award-winning Hammerschmidt

847
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,470
進行過面對面的談話
for an interview only hours before.

848
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:25,410
除表達哀悼之外
Along with her condolences,

849
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:28,870
總統也借此機會呼吁施行更嚴格的槍支管制
the President used the opportunity to call for greater gun control,

850
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,430
尤其在市中心區
particularly in our inner cities.

851
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:32,890
該死
Fuck!

852
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,090
他給你的最后一樣東西
The last thing he gave you.

853
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,460
如果你不告訴我是什么意思的話
If you don't tell me what it means...

854
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,610
我倒希望你能告訴我是什么意思  克萊爾
I was kind of hoping you could tell me, Claire.

855
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,010
道格  湯姆·哈默施密特死了
Doug, Tom Hammerschmidt is dead.

856
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,390
還有凱茜  簡
Cathy, Jane.

857
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,020
比爾·謝潑德也要去蹲監獄了
Bill Shepherd is going to prison.

858
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,060
馬克已經四面楚歌
Mark has no one to turn to.

859
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,000
只有你和我了
It's just you and me.

860
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,800
失陪一下
Gimme a moment, please.

861
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,520
你得知道
Please know.

862
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,130
讓這三個可憐人的靈魂
The thought of accelerating the exit

863
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,370
提前從人間消失的決定
of three poor souls from this earth

864
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,660
非常痛苦
is beyond painful.

865
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,120
抱歉了
Sorry about that.

866
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,120
沒關系
Not at all.

867
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,040
我并不擔心你  道格
I'm not worried about you anymore, Doug.

868
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,090
你不會做任何傷害弗蘭西斯的事  你做不到
You wouldn't do anything to hurt Francis. You're not capable.

869
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,680
而且問題在于
And see, the thing is...

870
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,430
不管弗蘭西斯給你留下了什么  都不屬于你
whatever Francis left you, it doesn't actually belong to you.

871
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:38,020
我們結婚時  把個人和共有財產安排得很清楚
We entered our marriage with a his, hers and ours agreement.

872
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,830
你的財產自己留著  任意處置
You keep and do whatever you want with yours,

873
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,110
而我的也歸我隨意使用
I keep and do whatever I want with mine.

874
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,650
你也想象得到  是我父母堅持的
My daddy and mother insisted, as you can imagine.

875
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,740
不過這個婚前協議  有一個條款
But the prenup we had, had a clause.

876
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,370
如果我們有了后代
If ever we have descendants together

877
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,830
而其中一方先于對方離世
and one of us is first to die,

878
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,960
我們同意將所有權利傳給后代
we agree to waive our rights to everything passed on.

879
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,460
這也就意味著
By which I mean,

880
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:04,310
弗蘭西斯所有的財產
all of Francis's assets

881
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,960
都屬于他的后代
are entitled to his heir.

882
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,170
如果他有一個的話
If he should have one.

883
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,730
上帝保佑  弗蘭西斯和我有孩子了
Francis and I have been blessed.

885
00:54:36,530 --> 00:55:21,520
{\an5}{\pos(193,147)}盡管同性戀婚姻合法化等熱點議題在美國民眾中越來越受到認同
美國百姓在墮胎合法性問題上的分歧并沒有隨著時間流逝有太多改變
根據蓋洛普調查的歷史數據  認為在懷孕的任何時間點  任何情況下
都可以墮胎的美國人  從1976年的22%緩慢增長到了2018年的29%
而在1976年有21%的美國人認為任何情況下都不能墮胎
這個比例到了2018年維持在20%
在兩種極端觀點變化不大的情況下  在過去四十年中
認為只有在特定情況下才可以墮胎的美國人也始終維持在50%左右

887
00:55:21,520 --> 00:56:21,520
{\an5}{\pos(193,147)}在美國的兩個政治黨派中  共和黨屬于"支持生命派"  整體上反對墮胎
具體到不同的政客
有的極端保守派認為任何情況下墮胎都是對胎兒的謀殺
而一些溫和派的共和黨則同意只有在極端情況下
如被強奸  胎兒診斷出疾病  懷孕威脅母親安全等  才可以進行墮胎
民主黨則整體上是"支持選擇派"
認為女性有權選擇怎樣對待自己的身體
拒絕認為胎兒是一個完整的生命
溫和派的民主黨認為墮胎要慎重  但是最終決定權在于母親
而激進的民主黨則認為
法律和社會在任何情況下都不應阻止懷孕婦女墮胎
在2016年大選中  共和黨候選人特朗普是堅定的反墮胎者
而民主黨候選人希拉里在這一問題上的態度
則從2008年時認為墮胎要慎重  轉為強調墮胎是女性不可剝奪的權力
