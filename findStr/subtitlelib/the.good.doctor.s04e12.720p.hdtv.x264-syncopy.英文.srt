18
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,360
I couldn't sleep.

19
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,570
We should start taking your blood pressure every day.

20
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,450
This is very sweet and responsible.

21
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,070
Yes, I am going to try to be extra responsible now.

22
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,950
Yeah.

23
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,360
W-we -- we have to talk about what we...want to do.

24
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,820
I love you.

25
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,610
I want a child.

26
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,950
So I want this child.

27
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,360
I love you, too.

28
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,820
And I do want kids, but it's complicated.

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,450
Is this the right time in my career?

30
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,280
In our relationship?

31
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,030
Am I too young?

32
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,070
Can we afford this?

33
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,610
Am I willing to make this commitment right now?

34
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,400
We can start depositing money

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
into a shared account for expenses,

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,820
and I can talk to Dr. Glassman about hiring you an assistant

37
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,990
to help with your workload --

38
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,110
Shaun, just slow down.

39
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,650
I-I don't need you to answer these questions now.

40
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,900
I just need to...think.

41
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,400
To figure out what to do.

42
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,030
And you do, too.

43
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,400
Dr. Chambers, I'd like you to meet a few of our residents.

44
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,440
- This is Doctor -- - I know that I'm old,

45
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,570
but I can still read name tags.

46
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,690
Dr. Chambers, you started experiencing aches

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,400
in your right hand a month ago?

48
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,530
Then tremors, weakness, spasms.

49
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,240
Had to drop out in the middle of a bowel resection last Friday.

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,610
I sent you a video of the surgery.

51
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,820
Given your symptoms, it seems that carpal tunnel --

52
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,110
Oh, it "seems."

53
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,450
Well, then, problem solved.

54
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,030
I'll be on my way.

55
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,940
Sir, can I just say that the documentary

56
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,150
on your work in Haiti changed my life.

57
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,490
It's the reason why I went into --

58
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,240
If you want to suck up to me, call me "doctor," not "sir."

59
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,320
And this is a hospital, not Coachella.

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,940
If you can't wear something appropriate,

61
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,610
at least try something that fits.

62
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,990
Rule out autoimmune disorders, hypothyroidism,

63
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,610
diabetes, amyloidosis, MS, and multiple myeloma.

64
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,150
Then we'll get back to carpal tunnel.

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,860
Alright.

66
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,650
If you have any other questions or concerns,

67
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,650
please don't hesitate --

68
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,610
Twelve.

69
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,530
First, I prefer blankets not made of sandpaper.

70
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,780
Second, dim these damn lights.

71
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,690
This isn't some San Fernando Valley porn shoot.

72
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,150
- Third -- - If you made a list,?

73
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,570
you don't need to tell us.

74
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,360
He's had the pain for nine months now.

75
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,030
And it's on both sides?

76
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,780
Sometimes his forehead,

77
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,400
other times his cheeks, his nose.

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,820
And it's persisting through very high doses of hydrocodone.

79
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,650
Yeah, obviously, the drugs don't work.

80
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,440
It's why I'm here.

81
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,450
Oscar.

82
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,360
It's a fair question.

83
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,650
Look, I'm sorry.

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,360
Okay, I've been to six doctors now.

85
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,070
I can't work.

86
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,200
I mean, I-I c-- I can't even kiss my wife.

87
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,150
I can hardly smile.

88
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,110
I'm just gonna lightly brush your cheek.

89
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,150
Okay.

90
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,950
Please...help me.

91
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,940
I've been on the phone for like an hour

92
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,900
with the cable company --

93
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,990
Lea's pregnant.

94
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,990
You want to have...

95
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,490
Yes.

96
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,860
I'm glad you're happy.

97
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,990
do you have any concerns?

98
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,820
Yes.

99
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,030
Sleep deprivation.

100
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,280
But I have started looking into an affordable night nurse.

101
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,190
Well, there's gonna be some bigger issues.

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,700
I mean, this is a...

103
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,110
This is a gigantic moment for anyone,

104
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,780
especially -- especially for you.

105
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,860
You mean...

106
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,110
because of my ASD?

107
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,280
Yeah, because of your ASD.

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,610
Because of your family.

109
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,360
Your job.

110
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,280
I mean...

111
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,820
A million things.

112
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,690
I don't want to tell you what -- what to --

113
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,280
I mean, I don't even know what I...

114
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,990
Having a child...

115
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,650
changes everything.

118
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,240
Nasal cavity's clear.

119
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,400
There's no abscess, facial tumor, or sinusitis.

120
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,530
It could be acoustic neuroma.

121
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,150
Without any hearing loss?

122
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,780
Let's do an MRI to check.

123
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,190
We've run eight negative tests already.

124
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,030
We don't need a ninth.

125
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,820
We do the tests till we know what he has.

126
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,240
It's fibromyalgia.

127
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,990
So, your diagnosis for his pain

128
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,700
is "pain that no one can explain"?

129
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,490
- Well done. - Some pain's unavoidable.

130
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,990
When I was competing in Tae Kwon Do,

131
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,570
they taught us to adjust our relationship to it,

132
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,610
learn to tolerate it.

133
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,740
It can make you stronger.

134
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,030
Wow. That statement has the absolute ideal ratio

135
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,570
of heartlessness, humble-bragging, and machismo.

136
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,530
Bravo.

137
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,740
Seriously? You're pleased with that?

138
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,780
"Machismo," Spanish, "bravo"'s Italian.

139
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,320
And "humble-bragging"'s 2011.

140
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,780
We can do better, don't you think?

141
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,820
Maybe we're not finding anything because it's psychological?

142
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,450
Some kind of conversion disorder?

143
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,150
You do the MRI.

144
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,200
I'll talk to the wife.

145
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,240
Negative for endocrine issues.

146
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,280
He's got a history of moderate carotid stenosis.

147
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,780
If enough plaque builds up,

148
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,030
starves the brain of oxygen,

149
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,440
maybe could cause the hand problems.

151
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,280
If it got that bad, we'd have already seen signs of a stroke.

152
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,650
Anyone else annoyed that we're wasting

153
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,320
all these resources to confirm what's clearly carpal tunnel?

154
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,530
He may be a jerk, but he's a great doctor.

155
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,740
If Silas Chambers has a medical opinion,

156
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,820
we better check it out.

157
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,610
I didn't think he was a jerk.

158
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,070
Dr. Andrews and Dr. Lim also criticize us

159
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,650
and have particular demands.

160
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,650
Yeah. They want us to improve.

161
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,150
How do you know Dr. Chambers doesn't?

162
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,780
He did improve Enrique.

163
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,200
Not kidding.

164
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,900
You look snazzy.

165
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,360
I know what Dr. Chambers has.

166
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,780
We're having trouble finding a physical basis

167
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,200
for your husband's pain.

168
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,900
And you defended me when I asked him

169
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,650
about painkillers earlier.

170
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,740
A few years ago, Oscar was on a job site.

171
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,150
Working crazy hours.

172
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,490
He was exhausted.

173
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,900
He shot himself with a -- with a nail gun.

174
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,150
Right through his palm.

175
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,150
We didn't have insurance,

176
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,110
so we went to this clinic, and, um...

177
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,900
Opioids?

178
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,400
Really bad.

179
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,700
Took a year for him to kick.

180
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,820
Now, um...he's taking more pills than ever.

181
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,950
Whenever I talk to him about getting help,

182
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,900
he just gets mad.

183
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,740
I, uh...

184
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,110
I had to move out last week.

185
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,070
I'm only here because he asked me to.

186
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,280
I think he's faking.

187
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,320
You threw 113 sutures in your last day of surgery.

188
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,290
In at least half,

189
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,150
I detected a very subtle tremor.

190
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,610
Congratulations on discovering a symptom I told you about.

191
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,440
It occurs during the part of your stitch

192
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,110
when the wrist is straight, not when it's bent.

193
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,820
That is not carpal tunnel.

194
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,780
It is musician's dystonia.

195
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,070
My wrist flexes on every suture.

196
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,280
You're talking about a difference of milliseconds.

197
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,400
Yes, he is.

198
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,690
Your condition was probably caused

199
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,400
by your repetitive technique.

200
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,030
Even Dr. Andrews throws sutures in varied ways.

201
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,150
You never do. This kind of obsessive behavior

202
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,990
is common for those with autism.

203
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,820
So, I can refer --

204
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
What did you just say?

205
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm not autistic.

206
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,570
Dr. Murphy didn't mean any offense.

207
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,570
He himself is on the spectrum.

208
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,780
Oh, is he?

209
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,990
I thought his robotic voice and hand clasping

210
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,070
were just charming affectations.

211
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,030
Do you really think I am anything like him?

212
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,990
I'm not saying that --

213
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,990
I am.

214
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,900
You're extremely organized.

215
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,610
You hardly make eye contact.

216
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,570
And given your problems with food, blankets,

217
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,610
and lighting, plus the fact you wear headphones even in surgery,

218
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,400
you clearly have sensory issues.

219
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm organized.

220
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,570
Would you rather I show up in the O.R. and just wing it?

221
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,860
I have good taste in food and music.

222
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,740
Now that's a mental disorder?

223
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,320
And as for eye contact...

224
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,030
Okay.

225
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,690
I didn't come here for a psych consult.

226
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,070
It was just an observation about a possible reason

227
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,440
for the behavior that led to your hand symptoms,

228
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,320
which is what we should be talking about.

229
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,440
Physical therapy is the recommended course for dystonia.

230
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm not wasting months on a treatment that won't work.

231
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,530
I want an MRI-guided ultrasound ablation

232
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,700
of the VO nucleus of the thalamus.

233
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,610
You want to jump to brain surgery?

234
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,820
I would jump right to amputating a toe

235
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,610
if it got me my career back.

236
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,320
What were you thinking?

237
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,110
You just supported me.

238
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,240
Yes, because part of my job is not yelling at residents

239
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,400
in front of patients.

240
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,490
What you did is equivalent to looking at a fuzzy MRI

241
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,110
and blurting out a patient has cancer.

242
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,780
Cancer can kill you.

243
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,650
Neither diagnosis is one a patient is excited to hear.

244
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,110
Prep him for the ablation.

245
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,530
And do not talk to him again about autism.

246
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,400
He's seen six doctors in the last month,

247
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,820
gotten three opioid prescriptions,

248
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,780
and he had a previous opioid problem.

249
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,240
It's textbook drug-seeking.

250
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,320
It's also textbook "a bunch of dingbats

251
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,150
missing a trigeminal neuralgia diagnosis."

252
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,240
Mm, his wife agrees with me. She knows him.

253
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,900
Would explain why yours left you.

254
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,440
Snap. Except my wife didn't leave me,

255
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,610
so neither a good point, nor even a clever one.

256
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,940
FIESTA imaging would take hours to set up,

257
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,240
cost the patient serious money,

258
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,530
and still come out negative.

259
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,320
Because...it's textbook drug-seeking.

260
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,320
We have other patients who need us.

261
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,150
I'm sending the discharge order.

262
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,070
I hate poop.

263
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,400
Like, what if I suck at changing diapers?

264
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,820
Maybe we should start with the bigger issues

265
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,740
and work our way down.

266
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,070
This isn't at the top of my list,

267
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,700
but since you are a doctor...

268
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,360
Shaun's ASD -- is it...?

269
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,450
Inheritable?

270
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Probably.

271
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,240
But it's unclear how much.

272
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,200
So, even that.

273
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,110
W-What am I supposed to do with that?

274
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,360
Think it through.

275
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,650
Let's say you have a little baby Shaun.

276
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,070
Like...tiny, honest,

277
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,700
brilliant guy who adores me...

278
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,030
Mini button-down,

279
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,240
teeny blue eyes...

280
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,450
And me?

281
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,820
A mom?

282
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,070
I mean, I'm not saying my life would be worse,

283
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,740
but it would just be so different

284
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,030
from what I was planning.

285
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,530
Not that I was really planning,

286
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,740
but I am enjoying just...

287
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,280
being.

288
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,990
And so what if you wait?

289
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,150
I just want to make sure I'm making the right decision.

290
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,070
I guess you'll never really know.

291
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,360
I had to make a lot of hard choices about my mom.

292
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,280
And I still wake up wondering

293
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,320
which of them went the wrong way.

294
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,530
But...you still gotta choose.

295
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,740
No abnormal signal in the mid pons.

296
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,450
So, are you and Dr. Park like this at home, too?

297
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,150
When I let him out of his cage for meals, yes.

298
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,400
Hey, we're almost --

299
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,990
Oh, come on.

300
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,150
Did you not get the text I didn't send about this?

301
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,860
Don't bother asking for consults if you're gonna --

302
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,900
Wait.

303
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,570
What's that on the right superior cerebellar artery?

304
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,110
An abnormal loop causing compression.

305
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,280
He has trigeminal neuralgia.

306
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,450
The pain's real.

307
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,650
We have good visualization

308
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,990
of the target area.

309
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,070
Connect the ultrasound to the stereotactic frame.

315
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,610
Ablation won't work.

316
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,780
You changed your mind?

317
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,280
You don't think he has dystonia?

318
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,820
He does, but it's a symptom.

319
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,900
His vertebral artery takes an aberrant course.

320
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,650
It is pressing against his spinal cord.

321
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,700
He needs vascular surgery or he'll die.

322
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,280
It's a disorder of the nerve that carries sensation

323
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,740
from the face to the brain.

324
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,690
And it's one of the most painful conditions that exists.

325
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,440
And very hard to diagnose.

326
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,780
Thank God Dr. Park approved all those tests.

327
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,610
Y-you were in agony.

328
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,820
And I...

329
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,240
I told him I thought you were lying.

330
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,900
You thought I was lying?

331
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,650
You thought I was just being an addict.

332
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,400
And still you came here with me.

333
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,570
Sat at my side.

334
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,200
We'd like to do a microvascular decompression.

335
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,900
We'd go in through the back of your skull

336
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,610
and put in a Teflon patch to cushion the affected nerve.

337
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,700
You're -- you're cutting into his brain?

338
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,610
It's relatively safe. And other options

339
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,280
are unlikely to relieve the pain.

340
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,490
Look, I-I'll do it.

341
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,650
Uh, thank you so much.

342
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,530
We want to run a vertebral artery BTO.

343
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,490
If you tolerate it, then we would sacrifice the --

344
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,240
Sacrifice the vessel with onyx embolization.

345
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
We recognize you might not love this proposal.

346
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,280
The one in which my hand weakness remains,

347
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,650
destroying my career?

348
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,940
Did you consider vertebral-to-vertebral artery bypass

349
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,440
with physical removal of the aberrant artery?

350
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,440
Mm, that would carry a very high risk for a stroke or bleed.

351
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,900
It would fix the dystonia and let me get back to work.

352
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,320
With your history of carotid stenosis,

353
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,530
it would be a coin flip whether you survive.

354
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,070
I can live with those numbers.

355
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,740
Or, for that matter, die with them.

356
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,990
Corridor to the trigeminal nerve origin is open.

357
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,610
I freed up the offending vessel.

358
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,740
Teflon sponge.

359
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,240
The sponge is too big.

360
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,360
It'll compress the brain stem.

361
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,280
I have at least 4 millimeters of room.

362
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,150
You have half that.

363
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,200
Yes, you have a better view 50 feet away.

364
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,820
How long have they been like this?

365
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,650
A while. It's getting worse, though.

366
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,030
Sorry, Park, you're right.

367
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,070
Just like you were when you decided

368
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,570
to discharge the sick guy.

369
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,780
Wow, you invented sarcasm.

370
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,780
Really impressive.

371
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,440
Hey, look at me, I'm using it, too.

372
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,900
Park, you missed the diagnosis.

373
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,780
Reznick, you ignored protocol.

374
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,490
How about you both show some humility and shut up?

375
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,820
Sorry.

376
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,860
Teflon's placed.

377
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,940
What if we used the saphenous vein for the bypass?

378
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,490
Not enough flow. He'll stroke out.

379
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,110
Carotid to distal vert, then?

380
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,900
Stenosis is too severe.

381
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,200
Dude's loaded.

382
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,530
He's at retirement age.

383
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,240
He could teach, travel, screw around all day.

384
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,200
Why is he demanding that we do this?

385
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,860
When you dedicate your life to something

386
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,030
that gives you meaning,

387
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,200
it starts to define you.

388
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,320
His decision may be irrational, but I get it.

389
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,320
I don't think it is irrational.

390
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,280
Dr. Chambers has no friends, no children,

391
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,990
no family, no outside interests.

392
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,490
If he can't be a surgeon, he'll have nothing.

393
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,900
I think our best bet is a radial graft.

394
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,530
Highest flow I can think of.

395
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,900
Any other ideas?

396
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,990
Okay. We go with the radial graft.

397
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,990
I'm impressed.

398
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,360
I was actually starting to wonder if I was losing my touch.

399
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,740
But then I had a dark afternoon of the soul

400
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,200
and suddenly I knew it --

401
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,200
those were totally solid burns.

402
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,110
Maybe not A+, but A-, B+ at the worst.

403
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,740
So it hit me -- your plan was to throw me off my game,

404
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,650
make me doubt myself --

405
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,070
I'm attracted to you.

406
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,110
I've been fighting this stupid feeling,

407
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,400
trying to find reasons to not...feel.

408
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,570
Are you kidding me?

409
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,860
Yes.

410
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,860
Your jokes were lame.

411
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,650
And that's how you screw with someone.

412
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,990
No.

413
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,950
You're not that good of a liar.

414
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,530
I-I can't have a roommate who has feelings for me.

415
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,030
Since when can't you take a joke?

416
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,740
Since my roommate hit on me.

417
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,610
You have to move out.

418
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,820
As soon as possible.

419
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,490
We've decided to use your radial artery for the graft.

420
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,360
We've scheduled an O.R. for tomorrow morning.

421
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,030
- Good call. - I agree.

422
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,400
You should risk your life for this surgery.

423
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,610
Are you being facetious?

424
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,780
No.

425
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,820
It just boggles the mind.

426
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,650
You can't understand what anyone means.

427
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,860
You can't express yourself like an adult.

428
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,690
You're a child playing dress-up.

429
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,740
And everyone here just plays along.

430
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,700
Let's go, Shaun.

431
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,360
Y-You're agitated.

432
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,400
I'm fine.

433
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,360
You are rubbing your mug.

434
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,690
People with ASD often have comfort objects

435
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,240
for when they become agitated.

436
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,110
I can order you propranolol.

437
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,860
You're gonna give me the Ruseckas Freedman

438
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,820
ASD Diagnostic Questionnaire,

439
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,900
and that's gonna shut your damn mouth.

440
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,740
Okay, the "Rafad-Q" is just a tool.

441
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,820
An official diagnosis needs to come from a psychiatrist.

442
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,190
Well, since I might be dead tomorrow,

443
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,070
this is your next-best option.

444
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,950
I'll get the test.

445
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,190
Why can't you treat people with just an ounce of respect?

446
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,860
Respect has to be earned, not doled out like candy.

447
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,650
No, that's just an excuse people like you use

448
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,150
to justify your garbage behavior.

449
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,860
That's just an excuse people like you use

450
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,780
to avoid facing reality.

451
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,990
No one was respectful to me when I was a resident.

452
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,110
They were dismissive and cruel.

453
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,200
But it lit a fire and it made me the man I am today.

454
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,450
The man that you came into my room idolizing.

455
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,650
Not anymore.

456
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,780
I'm devastated.

457
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,990
Surgeons deal in human lives,

458
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,920
not childish fantasies.

459
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,590
If you want to succeed,

460
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,550
you're gonna have to be a lot more like me.

461
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,870
Everything okay?

462
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,360
- Yep. - Surgery went very smoothly.

463
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,860
No pain right now.

464
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,720
Want to take it for a test drive?

465
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,900
It's worse.

466
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,150
Collateral circulation is not ideal.

467
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,700
How are we gonna harvest the artery?

468
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,450
What's going on?

469
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,030
How much am I gonna have to change who I am to be a surgeon?

470
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,100
Ah, to be great -- or even good -- at anything,

471
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,460
we have to compromise.

472
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,030
I used to get too emotionally involved in my work,

473
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,390
with patients, everyone.

474
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,420
And I had to learn to distance myself.

475
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,470
Yeah, you've really grown cold and heartless.

476
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,840
I have changed. We all end up changing.

477
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,140
You just got to try and make it a good change.

478
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,760
I don't want to change.

479
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,070
I want to change what's around me.

480
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,360
Oh, I'll figure it out.

481
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,440
I'm sure you will.

482
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,620
Hey, you're the guy who makes living in a van look cool.

483
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,090
So, uh, the circulation...

484
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,290
The right side looks like it has better length.

485
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,900
Given the poor outcome,

486
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,330
we can't recommend further surgery right now.

487
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,360
We suggest six months of pain medication

488
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,190
and referrals to neurology and pain management specialists.

489
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,620
W-What surgery aren't you recommending?

490
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,300
A DREZ lesioning.

491
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,380
We'd cut the signal from the trigeminal nerve

492
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,380
to the sensory areas of your brain.

493
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,190
But there's a real possibility of paralysis

494
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,690
on one side of your body.

495
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,070
I want the surgery.

496
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,050
Baby, I'll help you manage the pain.

497
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,570
I-I'll move back in.

498
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,380
I'll take care of you.

499
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,240
You know how I treated you before.

500
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,730
I'm only gonna get worse.

501
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,550
I would never leave you again.

502
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,720
That's what scares me.

503
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,880
I'd start cutting you down,

504
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,750
being cruel,

505
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,810
and you'd just put up with it.

506
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,800
I won't let that happen.

507
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,610
We'll prep an O.R.

508
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,350
"I frequently point out other people's mistakes."

509
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,730
That's a yes.

510
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,120
"People tell me I overthink things."

511
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,330
Only people who underthink things.

512
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,970
But, fine, another yes.

513
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,120
"I sometimes speak in an abnormal tone."

514
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,390
Who thinks they speak in an abnormal tone?

515
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,730
Just mark no.

516
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,390
How many more of these?

517
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,180
None.

518
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,740
Your answers are fully congruent with someone on the spectrum.

519
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,260
No.

520
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,170
You keyed it wrong.

521
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,800
- No, look. No, I - Or something.

522
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,900
- Here. Look, I didn't. - No, give it to me.

523
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,220
- No, I -- ? - Oh! Don't!

524
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,150
You idiot! S-Stupid, careless --

525
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,430
I-I stepped back --

526
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,720
Get out of my room.

527
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,830
- Get out! ? - Okay.

528
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,110
Make sure we're not impacting normal spinal cord pathways.

529
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,080
Somatosensories are at baseline.

530
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,590
BP's steady.

531
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,250
Leg and arm SSEPs at 50% decreased amplitude.

532
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,080
Check the cord above and below for hematoma

533
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,360
or bony compression.

534
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,790
Cord's fine.

535
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,760
Push IV fluids and start pressors.

536
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,820
So, what is it?

537
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,110
I don't know.

538
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,520
Any issues with motor potentials?

539
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,500
Unilateral amplitude down 70%.

540
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,340
We're about to get total neurological collapse.

541
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,250
It's a clot from a small branch artery.

542
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,780
We checked the spinal blood vessels --

543
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,790
The outside.

544
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,190
But the electrode could have injured a sulcal artery.

545
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,810
We need to follow the DREZ pathway inward

546
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,110
and search for a small clot.

547
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,330
Start at the site of last ablation with the electrode.

548
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,630
It's gotta be deep.

549
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,130
This'll be easier if she's in here.

550
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,600
Scrub in, Dr. Reznick.

551
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,960
We're setting up the neuromonitoring

552
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,470
for Silas' surgery.

553
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,150
He's angry with me.

554
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,330
Silas?

555
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,140
He's angry with everyone.

556
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,370
Dr. Andrews said to stop talking to him about ASD.

557
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,540
But I brought it up anyway, gave him a test,

558
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,320
his mug broke, and I don't know what to do now.

559
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,480
I don't know what to feel. And Lea --

560
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,010
Lea told me about the pregnancy.

561
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,860
Is this hard for me because I'm dealing with both things at once?

562
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,430
I think both things are related.

563
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,930
What if my child...

564
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,340
has no friends?

565
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,740
What if they're picked on?

566
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,650
This is not small-town Wyoming.

567
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,930
The world has changed, Shaun.

568
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,400
I haven't changed.

569
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,550
How can I...

570
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,820
...know what they're feeling?

571
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,600
How can I comfort them?

572
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,200
How can I be a good father?

573
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,890
Remember when we first met?

574
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,740
Right over there?

575
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,000
You were mad at me.

576
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,780
Yeah. But you were right about the patient.

577
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,600
And you were stubborn. And crazy smart.

578
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,820
And you are still all of those things.

579
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:43,990
But if you were still just that guy

580
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,460
that I met running through those doors,

581
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,310
we would not be sitting here right now.

582
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,160
You have changed.

583
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,790
You've adapted. You've grown.

584
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,440
Do you know how hard that is?

585
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,990
Most people don't even try.

586
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:08,620
And you are going to grow into a great father.

587
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,030
Whenever it happens.

588
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,670
Slowly go perpendicular at the angle of our ablation electrode.

589
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,600
Still not seeing the clot.

590
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,480
Amplitude loss at 80%.

591
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,660
Maybe it's not a clot.

592
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,850
Maybe it's something higher up, in the brain.

593
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,900
No. You were right the first time.

594
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,080
Maybe it's hiding behind some ultrasound-impervious segment.

595
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,850
Cut the dentate ligament.

596
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,410
It'll get more lateral access.

597
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,710
Completely section the ligament.

598
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,680
I see it.

599
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,220
Removing the clot.

600
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,650
Amplitude returning to normal baseline.

601
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,340
Let me know if you need me.

602
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,260
We're good.

603
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,430
Thank you.

604
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,990
We did good together.

605
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,480
We did.

606
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,590
You still have to move out, though. Tonight.

607
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,370
On my first day here, Dr. Melendez said

608
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,160
I would never do anything besides suction.

609
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,920
But later, he let me make my first surgical incision.

610
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,880
He became my friend.

611
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,900
I miss him.

612
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,350
Are you in the right room?

613
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,370
Did somebody tell you I needed pointless stories?

614
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,500
I used to think

615
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,460
being a doctor was all I needed to make me happy.

616
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,730
It did make me happy.

617
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,140
But I realized I wanted more.

618
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,300
And that I could have more.

619
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,570
I changed.

620
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,300
You can change, too.

621
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,140
But not if you're dead from this surgery.

622
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,550
I've made up my mind.

623
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,950
Please leave.

624
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,740
My brother Steve,

625
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,820
he gave me a plastic scalpel before he died.

626
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,760
It broke. I was very sad.

627
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,570
I asked you to leave.

628
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,090
When I fixed my scalpel, it made me feel better.

629
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,600
I was 9 years old when my father died.

630
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,490
I loved drinking hot chocolate with him in the morning.

631
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,940
He'd bring me a mug after every business trip.

632
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,770
He understood me.

633
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,170
My mother didn't.

634
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,650
Nobody did.

635
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,230
I tried fitting in, but...

636
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,400
I got frustrated.

637
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,040
So I gave up.

638
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,840
On relationships.

639
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,510
On friends.

640
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,870
On all but the one thing I was good at.

641
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,570
And now, Dr. Murphy, I'm too old.

642
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
I've made too many enemies.

643
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,530
Too many mistakes.

644
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:12,220
People tolerate me because I save lives.

645
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,570
Without that...

646
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:23,090
why would anyone ever care about me?

647
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,670
I care.

648
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,510
That smells good.

649
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,960
Bland.

650
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,370
Mm, pasta with olive oil.

651
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,670
Kinda puke-proof.

652
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,760
Have you thought any more about...

653
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,510
Yes.

654
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,290
I made a list.

655
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,720
I guess I've learned from you.

656
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,810
What's the first thing yours says?

657
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,340
That I think I would be a good father...

658
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,290
but that I can't know for sure.

659
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,680
You'd make a great dad.

660
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,820
It's on my list.

661
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,360
You were right.

662
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,440
It is very complicated.

663
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,380
But I do know...

664
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,730
...I want you to be happy, Lea.

665
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,440
I have so many reasons to do this.

666
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,430
And so many doubts.

667
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,140
I'm just scared, Shaun.

668
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,830
But if we are both having doubts,

669
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:10,880
then maybe now isn't the right time.

670
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,150
Okay.

671
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,180
I see that my hemoglobin's stable

672
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,360
and my white count is fine.

673
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,370
Yeah. We just wrote your discharge orders.

674
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,580
This is a referral for an ASD specialist.

675
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,730
I can look into that on my own.

676
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,950
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

677
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,330
And thank you, Dr. Guerin.

678
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,050
Welcome back.

679
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,870
Did it work?

680
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,950
Let's find out.

681
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,670
Your hand's cold.

682
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,290
I'm transferring out.

683
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,630
Last year, I applied to a program at Johns Hopkins.

684
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,090
They train doctors to travel the world, help out needy areas.

685
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,290
They'll let me enroll late.

686
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,910
Sounds like a good place for you.

687
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,970
Thanks for always being a great boss.

688
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,060
And a great friend.

689
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,920
Can't have been that great, sneaking out like this.

690
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,890
Uh, actually, for the first time I can remember,

691
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,720
it felt hard to say goodbye.

692
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,510
You're always doing so much for other people.

693
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,480
Please don't forget to do something for yourself every now and then.

694
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,160
Were you messing with me or not?

695
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,630
If I was, would you let me stay?

696
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,180
Yes.

697
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,360
I wasn't messing with you.

698
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,790
Then I guess it's good we're not roommates anymore.

699
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,480
'Cause I couldn't do this.

700
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,820
This is a one-time thing.

701
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,620
Unless I change my mind.

702
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,480
So consider that an incentive.
