23
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,040
Today is not Saturday.

24
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,870
Why did you make me pancakes?

25
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,190
They are fresh start pancakes.

26
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,600
Like the first day of school every year

27
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,410
when you get to wear a brand-new outfit.

28
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,940
Well, not everyone wore a new outfit.

29
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,840
But the rule in this house

30
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,080
is that when you start a new life event,

31
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,460
you get pancakes.

32
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,750
I...don't want a fresh start.

33
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,610
I want to stay in surgery.

34
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,560
I know.

35
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,080
And I am really proud of you

36
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,040
for handling it all so...

37
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,880
Doctors -- please give me one more minute.

38
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,520
We have an associate pastor at the church,

39
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,170
but Clarence likes to write the sermons.

40
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,380
- Sorry. - Please.

41
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,240
Although this is important too.

42
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,100
The surgery consists of two steps --

43
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,400
first we fuse the spine to stabilize it,

44
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,930
and then we remove the tumor.

45
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,990
Because the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes,

46
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,790
you'll still have to follow up with chemo.

47
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,160
Clarence, are you in pain?

48
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,880
Quite a bit actually, but I'm fine.

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,280
Well, since what's causing your pain

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,190
is the tumor pushing against your spine,

51
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,380
the spinal fusion will ease pressure on your nerves

52
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,600
and should eliminate your pain.

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,080
Please, I, uh... I need this pain.

54
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,780
Can't you just do the second part and remove the tumor?

55
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,290
If we don't fuse the spine,

56
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,760
it'll make removing the tumor a lot more difficult.

57
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,510
More difficult, but it can be done?

58
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,310
It can. But I recommend against it.

59
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,260
Especially since there's no reason not to.

60
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,030
I did something...

61
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,720
unforgivable.

62
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,300
This pain is my punishment.

63
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,180
Can I ask what you did that was so bad?

64
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,400
I killed someone.

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,650
My sister and I were coming home from climbing Mt. Whitney.

66
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,320
We're doing the State 50 climbs.

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,980
The numbness started during the climb?

68
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,820
First my hands, and then my feet.

69
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,290
- You have a headache? - Yeah.

70
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,360
High altitude causes headaches.

71
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,750
Dehydration compounds it.

72
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,690
From now on just... climb slower.

73
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,900
And drink more.

74
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,410
Tell them about the other thing.

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,590
Before leaving for the mountain,

76
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,550
I had this weird sensation like...

77
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,280
dread.

78
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,910
I couldn't shake it.

79
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,680
Well, when people describe a sense of impending doom,

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,840
it's usually anxiety.

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,020
No, it was like a premonition...

82
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,560
that I was going to die.

83
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,010
- I'm sure it was -- - Dr. Park will run a brain scan,

84
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,430
and we'll do some lab work.

85
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,380
Shaun.

86
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,340
Hello, Dr. Lever.

87
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,630
Carly is fine.

88
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,780
Welcome to pathology.

89
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,260
It is going to be great working with you.

90
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,930
What do you think?

91
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,410
I know it's a lot to take in.

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,580
It's kind of like your first time at Disneyland, right?

93
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,490
I've never been to Disneyland.

94
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,380
Let me give you a tour.

95
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,110
Cytopathology, forensics,

96
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,580
genomics, microbiology.

97
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,630
We get to identify organisms,

98
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,140
interpret cell morphology,

99
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,790
sequence genes.

100
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,470
Is that a D300e

101
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,250
pathogen antibacterial bioprinter?

102
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,470
It's new.

103
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,920
You're working on antibiotic resistance

104
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,800
in emerging microorganisms?

105
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,560
It's "We" now, Shaun.

106
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,420
Yes, we are.

107
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,920
Do you want to play with it?

108
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,800
Very much.

109
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,410
Go ahead.

110
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,440
It's kind of your job now.

111
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,170
We are the detectives.

112
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,170
Surgeons are just the beat cops.

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,650
Our best bet is to try to separate the tumor from his cord,

114
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,030
and then resect it.

115
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,900
Okay, this is insane.

116
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,480
You know how he "killed" a person?

117
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,310
He was counseling a parishioner who committed suicide.

118
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,630
That must have been traumatic.

119
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,300
Traumatic, yes. Murder, no.

120
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,500
Hey, I know it's stupid, but he has autonomy.

121
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,380
I didn't stay stupid. I said "Insane."

122
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,530
You want to override his wishes because he's religious?

123
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,360
Something like 90% of Americans believe in God.

124
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,100
I'm one of them. Are we all mentally impaired?

125
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,320
Should you ignore us all if you don't like our choices?

126
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,920
Only those getting divine messages from their tumors.

127
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,580
- He's not crazy. - Okay, you're right.

128
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,360
He is just stupid. But don't we have a duty to educate him?

129
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,860
- You're gonna talk him out of his religion? - No.

130
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,530
You told him the surgery was more dangerous this way.

131
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,890
I don't think he appreciated how much more dangerous.

132
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,650
Good idea.

133
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,350
He thinks he'll go to hell if he dies before he's forgiven.

134
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,060
Make sure he knows it can happen on the table.

135
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,140
An MRI for anxiety?

136
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,940
It does fly in the face of reducing unnecessary medical tests.

137
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,020
When I was a resident,

138
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,460
I had a patient come through the E.R.

139
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,400
Female. 35 years old.

140
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,400
Slight cough. Slightly hypothyroid.

141
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,550
Normal vitals.

142
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,510
I labeled her a whiner because she kept insisting,

143
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,690
"I'm gonna die."

144
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,530
I sent her home.

145
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,070
And she died?

146
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,690
No. She kept coming back.

147
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,240
Over and over again.

148
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,900
We do this test, we prove there's nothing wrong with her,

149
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,490
we send her home reassured.

150
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,660
Damn.

151
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,210
The MRI showed a high grade meningioma.

152
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,530
An advanced tumor that grows in the tissue layers

153
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,650
that cover the brain.

154
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,800
Its features are consistent with it being malignant.

155
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,580
These tumors tend to be aggressive

156
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,430
and impossible to fully resect.

157
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,680
Um, so what -- what can you do?

158
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,320
Palliative care,

159
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,380
symptom control with medications.

160
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,140
You're risking spinal damage,

161
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,400
paralysis...death.

162
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,080
If that's what God chooses, then that is His will.

163
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,380
If you have cancer because He wants you to have cancer,

164
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,950
why are you here? Getting treatment?

165
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,050
I'm here because I believe in science.

166
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,320
I am who I am because I believe in God.

167
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,920
So do you think all people who are sick

168
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,210
are being punished?

169
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,090
I mean, we have an eight-year-old down the hall

170
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,330
with bone cancer,

171
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,500
you want to go tell her God hates her?

172
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,750
I'm sure that girl is not suffering as a punishment.

173
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,670
She's suffering so others may have a chance

174
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,970
to show her mercy,

175
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,530
to show her compassion, so she can inspire.

176
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,540
I don't know His plan,

177
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,840
but I know it's not as simple as you would --

178
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,140
No. No, it's not simple.

179
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,230
Except for your pain.

180
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,650
His name was Michael.

181
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,720
His wife found his body.

182
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,940
You had no idea.

183
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,680
I knew he was depressed.

184
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,920
But you thought he was getting better.

185
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,960
I didn't take his call.

186
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,960
Because I was having a drink.

187
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,240
It'd been a long day dealing with the renovations,

188
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,070
and I was having a damn drink.

189
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,070
Hey, Shaun.

190
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,590
Hey, Carly.

191
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,660
I started Sadie Barnes on anti-seizure medication,

192
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,570
need you to run a peak phenytoin level.

193
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,090
The couriers must be happy that the surgeons

194
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,380
are doing their own specimen deliveries.

195
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,530
How you doing down here?

196
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,270
Carly says pathologists are the detectives,

197
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,260
surgeons are just the beat cops.

198
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,310
Shaun, are you happy here?

199
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,660
When did you give the patient her loading dose?

200
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,770
One hour ago.

201
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,740
Shaun, if you're happy, that's great.

202
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,260
But if you're not,

203
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,610
you have to tell Han how you feel.

204
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,490
You need to show him you care

205
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,150
and that you believe in yourself.

206
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,900
Do you need this done STAT?

207
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,840
No. She's asymptomatic.

208
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,730
- It's just for seizure prevention. - Good.

209
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,170
Carly says that in pathology

210
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,060
you can take a break whenever you want.

211
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,490
I want to take a break now. I'm going for a walk.

212
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,700
He shouldn't be in pathology.

213
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,950
- He's a good surgical resident. - You're right.

214
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,070
- Then you'll move him back? - No.

215
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,100
You're wrong about that part. He should be in pathology.

216
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,600
But he was a good surgical resident.

217
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,110
Then why --

218
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,630
Because he'll never be a good surgeon.

219
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,200
How do you think he'll do in three years

220
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,840
when no one's looking over his shoulder?

221
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,780
When he's looking over someone else's shoulder?

222
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,850
Supervising new residents, leading grand rounds,

223
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,840
advocating for vulnerable patients.

224
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,520
Do you see him doing any of that without a safety net?

225
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,860
We can help him get there.

226
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,640
Just because he wants to be a surgeon,

227
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,950
just because you want him to be a surgeon,

228
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,140
doesn't mean he gets to have that dream come true.

229
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,670
Has it occurred to you that maybe

230
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,510
we know Shaun better than you do?

231
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,330
Has it occurred to you that

232
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,820
that might be your problem?

233
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,980
That your view of him might be distorted because you like him?

234
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:51,930
Has it occurred to you

235
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,070
that maybe he's better off in pathology?

236
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,970
That maybe he'll even like it?

237
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,950
Do you care?

238
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,330
I thought you might.

239
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,220
We need better ventral exposure.

240
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,610
Drill off more of the pedicle and vertebral body.

241
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,840
Ligate the exiting nerve root.

242
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,920
We'll take it with the tumor for a wider margin.

243
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,020
I can't see it.

244
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,740
The tumor's causing the spinal cord to be bowed up to us.

245
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,520
We need more exposure to get around and in front of it.

246
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,620
The vertebrae is too fragmented and displaced.

247
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,960
We can't get a complete resection

248
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,320
without stabilization.

249
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,210
He's tanking.

250
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,840
Probably spinal shock from tension on the cord.

251
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,060
We need to abort.

252
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,820
All right, on three. One, two, three.

253
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,120
You fixed me!

254
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,410
- No, no. - What happened to my pain?!

255
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,320
- Stop! ? - We didn't fix you.

256
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,530
There was a complication. We injected anesthetic.

257
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,610
It'll wear off.

258
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,090
We had to stop the surgery

259
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,960
before we could remove the tumor.

260
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,730
You went into shock.

261
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,820
We lost your heart rate and blood pressure.

262
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,760
We warned it would be a trickier surgery

263
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,810
without the fusion.

264
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,620
Nothing has changed. The anesthetic will wear off,

265
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,070
the pain will come back, but worse.

266
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,460
When can you try again?

267
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,500
Try again? We failed.

268
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,070
There is no reason to think we will succeed next time

269
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,550
But you know  what the issues are, --

270
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,510
unless we do the fusion

271
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,540
- you learned -- - Why haven't you?

272
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,400
Do think God wants you to die?

273
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,390
Please.

274
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,360
Try again.

275
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,850
Cyanide poisoning.

276
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,100
The cause of death on the Atlin case.

277
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,570
You know how I found it?

278
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,080
I smelled it -- almonds.

279
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,070
Dr. Park's patient.

280
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,300
I flagged her eosinophil count --

281
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,370
it doesn't match up with the diagnosis

282
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,700
of advanced meningioma listed on the requisition.

283
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,440
Great. Nice work.

284
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,380
I'm going to talk to Dr. Lim about it.

285
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,830
Whoa there, Shaun. Hold up.

286
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,150
You don't need to do that.

287
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,230
The attendings are on the lookout for the flags.

288
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,970
- They'll run with it. - I want to run with it.

289
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,400
You've been on the receiving end --

290
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,230
you know how it works.

291
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,330
How it works is I see something abnormal

292
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,120
and then I discuss it with the team,

293
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,120
and we plan how we'll fix it.

294
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,280
We run with it.

295
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,070
Shaun, once a test is done,

296
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,330
we move on to the next one.

297
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,160
I'd like to... take a walk.

298
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,640
Are you going to walk to Dr. Lim

299
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,370
and discuss this case, Shaun?

300
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,360
That's not what we do here.

301
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,540
We investigate, report,

302
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,680
and then we move on.

303
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,600
Are you gonna be able to do that...

304
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,770
move on?

305
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,670
I don't know.

306
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,920
But I will try very hard.

307
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,910
Next time.

308
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,280
Dr. Browne.

309
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,330
Is this about a patient?

310
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,960
No.

311
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,060
Come in.

312
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,070
I've heard a lot about you --

313
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,870
I'm aware you stood up to a supervisor.

314
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,330
Is that what's happening now?

315
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,380
I put together a list of cases

316
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,330
which Dr. Murphy contributed to.

317
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,320
Uniquely.

318
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,890
You're a loyal friend.

319
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,400
I've specified the ideas he had --

320
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,890
ideas that no one else around here could have --

321
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,230
Do you think I hate him?

322
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,040
No.

323
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,790
But I think

324
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,930
you might be biased against him

325
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,920
because of his condition.

326
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,600
So he doesn't have communication issues?

327
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,610
- I'm wrong about that? - No. But he --

328
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,530
If he had the flu, I would tell him to stay home

329
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,830
until he got better.

330
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,920
He has autism --

331
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,900
I could tell him to stay home until he gets better.

332
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,790
Instead I found a place for him to help us,

333
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,690
to save lives.

334
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,510
And you should know I have rather mixed feelings about loyalty.

335
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,260
All righty. There you go.

336
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,470
Hello.

337
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,860
Aaron.

338
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,600
It's good to see you.

339
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,290
Yeah. The feeling is mutual.

340
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,760
Can I have one of those?

341
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,180
- The chocolate chip muffin? - Yes, please.

342
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,150
Special occasion?

343
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,660
Yes.

344
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,360
As of today, I am no longer injecting toxins into my body.

345
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,230
Except, of course, with chocolate chips.

346
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,570
Oh, you're done with chemo? Wow. That's amazing.

347
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,040
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

348
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,700
I was thinking of going out tonight and celebrating

349
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,250
what may be very good news.

350
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,440
If you're free, my treat.

351
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,030
I -- I'm sorry, Aaron.

352
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,550
I have a-another commitment.

353
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,090
Oh. Um, tomorrow then?

354
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,790
This week is really crazy.

355
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,930
You know what? I am not doing chemo

356
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:23,760
every night next week, so I am free every single night, so --

357
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,560
Aaron, I'm seeing someone.

358
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,450
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,790
Nothing to be sorry about.

360
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,970
It was good to see you.

361
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,120
Keep an extra close eye on blood pressure and heart rate.

362
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,860
I have extra fluid, vasopressors,

363
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,030
and inotropes ready.

364
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,720
Why no God?

365
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,930
You follow in the tradition that you're handed.

366
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,500
My family wasn't religious. We never went to church.

367
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,870
I was there every Sunday.

368
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,980
8:00 a.m. for Catholic mass.

369
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,900
My parents eventually got tired of all the rules

370
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,960
and turned Lutheran.

371
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,930
They found that dull and went back to Catholic.

372
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,560
That's my tradition.

373
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,110
What do you think it'll be like when you die?

374
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,230
Probably like it was before I was born.

375
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,540
A whole lot of nothing.

376
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,760
We're there.

377
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,430
Where we were when everything went wrong last time.

378
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,050
We need to remove the tumor without putting any pressure

379
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,930
on his cord at all, or he'll be back in spinal shock.

380
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,880
And we need more tumor release from the vertebral body.

381
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,200
Extend your osteotomies proximal and distal.

382
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,590
Good.

383
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,360
I think I got a free plane...

384
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,660
Retract it from the cord a little more.

385
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,110
- I got it. - Now, when you remove it

386
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,900
careful not to morselize it.

387
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,660
Can you hold that up?

388
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,700
Dr. Reznick, give me a measurement.

389
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,080
Max length is 4.5.

390
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,040
Get a pre-op scan up.

391
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,210
That says the tumor's eight centimeters.

392
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,360
How does a tumor shrink from 8 centimeters to 4.5

393
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,260
without radiation in two weeks?

394
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,930
It doesn't.

395
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,910
Why the page, Shaun? And why are you in radiology?

396
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,540
We rely on flags.

397
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,580
You have to count on the ordering physician

398
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,150
seeing it while you move on to something else.

399
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,050
- Okay. And... - I don't agree with Sadie Barnes' diagnosis,

400
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,260
and I think her tumor should be biopsied.

401
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,140
- Shaun, I -- - Dr. Han wanted me away from patients.

402
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,140
Patients are not allowed in the viewing room.

403
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,790
So I'm not doing anything wrong.

404
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,100
Two radiologists said

405
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,110
it was a malignant meningioma

406
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,770
in the insular region and encasing the MCA vessels.

407
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,070
That's exactly where it is.

408
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,740
And her clinical picture matches perfectly --

409
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,300
arm and leg numbness.

410
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,120
The tumor attachment to the dura is slightly anomalous.

411
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,730
And the insular region is slightly atypical, too.

412
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,490
What differential diagnoses are you proposing?

413
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,070
I need to speak to the patient.

414
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,170
Should I ask Dr. Han for permission?

415
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,330
Shaun, I...

416
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,800
...will bring your concern about the scan

417
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,220
to the head of radiology.

418
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,750
But approaching Dr. Han? Don't do that.

419
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,310
Now, I already talked to him about your reassignment.

420
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,230
I don't know if it'll make any difference --

421
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,280
If I were Claire, would you let me approach Dr. Han

422
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,220
about something that concerned me?

423
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,560
Yes. I probably would.

424
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,580
Is that because Claire doesn't make mistakes

425
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,320
when she's communicating?

426
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,240
Yes.

427
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,300
Then do you think Dr. Han made the right decision

428
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,160
by sending me to pathology?

429
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,750
No.

430
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,280
The lymph nodes have shrunk, too.

431
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,280
This is a PET scan from two weeks ago.

432
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,070
Enlarged and cancerous.

433
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,970
Today... ?

434
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,230
They've all regressed.

435
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,840
Spontaneous regression has been reported

436
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,630
in melanomas, renal cell carcinomas,

437
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,170
neuroblastomas, and some types of blood cancers.

438
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,240
In a sarcoma that's metastasized?

439
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,720
No. But if it happened in those others, why not?

440
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,250
Because none of them make sense.

441
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,460
When I read about disappearing cancer,

442
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,480
I always think some doctor missed something,

443
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,520
forgot something,

444
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,920
screwed up something.

445
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,480
The theory is that the body somehow triggers

446
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,280
an immune response against the cancer.

447
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,860
Something somehow lights a fuse.

448
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,070
The theory says the fuse is lit by an infection.

449
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,140
His lab work proves he hasn't had one.

450
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,040
At this point, the most credible explanation is --

451
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,270
Are you gonna use the "m" word?

452
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,730
You seriously can't say it?

453
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,500
Only when referencing the 1980 U.S. hockey team.

454
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,760
Keep testing. Anything you can think of.

455
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,330
Molecular markers, T-cells, PD-L1.

457
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,330
We'll need permission from the patient.

458
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,050
Which raises another issue --

459
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,760
what are we gonna do next, medically?

460
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,640
He was supposed to start chemo next week.

461
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,060
No, it'll wipe out his immune system,

462
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,130
which may be what's actually killing his cancer.

463
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,940
If we don't know what's making him better,

464
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,590
we don't know what to stop, what to start.

465
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,760
So we do nothing?

466
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Just trust God to fix him?

467
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,950
We trust whatever is currently fixing him, to keep fixing him.

468
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,700
If he took a Tylenol yesterday at 8:00,

469
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,410
he takes a Tylenol today at 8:00.

470
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,570
Monitor him. Closely. Scans constantly.

471
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,050
Hello, Dr. Glassman.

472
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,390
Thank you for coming.

473
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,140
He has been doing this for two hours.

474
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,310
Shaun.

475
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,690
What are you up to?

476
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,580
Alphabetizing our canned goods

477
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,090
and checking all the expiration dates.

478
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,360
Well, somebody's got to do it.

479
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,700
- Is something wrong? - No.

480
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,710
- Okay. - Okay. I think

481
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,340
Dr. Lim's patient's diagnosis is wrong,

482
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,600
but I can't prove it without information,

483
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,590
and I'm not allowed to talk to patients.

484
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,760
Shaun.

485
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,260
I want to run with things.

486
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,190
I want to fix people.

487
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,440
Can you help me become a surgical resident again?

488
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,170
No. I can't, Shaun.

489
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,860
- I'm not president - Yes.

490
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,470
I'm not the president of the hospital anymore, Shaun.

491
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,800
And even -- even if I was...

492
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,080
...it's irrelevant.

493
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,000
You have to stand up for yourself.

494
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,890
And you know what? If you can't,

495
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,750
then the new Head of Surgery, the Chief, he's right.

496
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,150
Now, I can go tell him he's wrong.

497
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,470
It won't do any good.

498
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,760
Or you can go show him.

499
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,270
I'm doing research concerning Sadie Barnes.

500
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,770
She's asleep.

501
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,610
Perfect. I'm not allowed to speak with her.

502
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,450
I'm looking for her sister Jess.

503
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,750
I haven't seen her. Sorry.

504
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,360
What are you doing?

505
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,680
Can you explain why,

506
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,220
instead of remaining in pathology as directed,

507
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,930
you were in a patient's room,

508
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,690
going through her purse?

509
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,090
I didn't speak to her. She was asleep.

510
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,110
Dr. Murphy, any reticence I had

511
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,850
about removing you from surgery just vanished.

512
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,240
You shouldn't be in contact with patients.

513
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,540
Or their families. Or anything they own.

514
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,230
Do you understand, or am I gonna be forced to fire you?

515
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,340
Sadie's social media says that

516
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,880
she finances her climbing travel

517
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,700
by working as a freelance food critic.

518
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,050
She reviewed a Japanese restaurant that used to have

519
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,850
a Restaurant Grading System Score of "A,"

520
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,850
but then it dropped to a "C," which corresponds

521
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,350
to very bad food safety practices.

522
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,560
Bad sushi can lead to worms, but it usually doesn't

523
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,770
because stomach acid almost always kills fish parasites.

524
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,400
But not if someone is taking an acid blocker,

525
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,740
which 60 million Americans are.

526
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,060
I saw a bottle in her purse.

527
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,210
Sadie could have sparganosis with an encapsulated worm 

528
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,520
that is mimicking a meningioma.

529
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,490
That's a good idea.

530
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,300
Excellent. I'll tell the patient.

531
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,990
I will tell the patient.

532
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,850
I'll tell her we're doing a biopsy

533
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,550
to confirm the initial diagnosis.

534
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,970
- But we're -- - It will tell us

535
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,830
if the initial diagnosis is correct.

536
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,140
Your theory is a real long shot.

537
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,760
It would be irresponsible to get her hopes up.

538
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,760
The surgery went well.

539
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,100
We were able to extract the entire tumor without complication.

540
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,230
Thank you.

541
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,770
When can we start chemo?

542
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,460
There are a few follow-up tests we want to run first.

543
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,960
And we want to retake your history.

544
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,380
Make sure we have a proper list

545
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,280
of all medications you've been taking.

546
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:15,330
You want to take his history? After the surgery?

547
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,720
What's going on? What are you not telling us?

548
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,450
- What went wrong? - Nothing.

549
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,790
The fact is, the surgery went...

550
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,670
better than we'd hoped.

551
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,880
Your cancer seems to be...

552
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,920
going away on its own.

553
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,070
We'll run our tests.

554
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,510
We're confident that there is a medical explanation.

555
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,680
Oh, Clarence.

556
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,870
- Hi. - Hi, Aaron.

557
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,540
Um, what I...

558
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,920
What I told you earlier, that I'm seeing someone...

559
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm not.

560
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,440
I mean, I-I-I had one date,

561
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,420
- but it wasn't, you know... - Okay.

562
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,260
We're -- we're just -- we're not a good match.

563
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,680
That's what I wanted to tell you.

564
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,770
That's not true, you know.

565
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,420
You know, that's not true.

566
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,750
You like me. A lot.

567
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,380
And I like you even more than that.

568
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,860
So what is this?

569
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,050
You know, I'd really rather not get into it.

570
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,510
- You came to my house.  - To tell you what I told you,

571
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,550
- which I just told you. - Okay, you came here to be honest,

572
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,260
and you're only gonna be honest halfway?

573
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,310
- You're not timid. - No.

574
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,330
Okay. Then what?

575
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,840
The last time I was here,

576
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,260
we were headed upstairs...

577
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,430
Yes, we were.

578
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,010
You fell.

579
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,900
Yes, I did.

580
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,100
I tried to help you, and you pushed me away.

581
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,390
- I was embarrassed. - You were sick.

582
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,160
- You needed help. - And I'm not sick anymore.

583
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,330
Maybe. And I want to go and celebrate.

584
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,380
With you. Specifically with you.

585
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,780
'Cause we have fun.

586
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,820
You -- you make -- you make me laugh.

587
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,280
You make me feel good.

588
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,680
I like being with you.

589
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,640
Sounds horrible.

590
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,080
But bad things are gonna happen.

591
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,640
Aaron, i-it can't just be about having fun together.

592
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,100
One of us is gonna get sick,

593
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,060
one of us is gonna need to be taken care of --

594
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,150
Wait, wait, wait. I just want to go out

595
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,440
and have a nice dinner with you.

596
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,930
Not to run away to Reno, find a priest in an Elvis suit.

597
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,450
What are we gonna do, Aaron?

598
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,020
Just drive to a hill with a view and neck till prom?

599
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,900
And then I'm gonna come home and hope you call?

600
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,200
Yeah, uh, you know, I just came to apologize.

601
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,700
I'm sorry.

602
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,120
And I'm really glad...

603
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,600
I'm -- I'm glad you're finished with chemo.

604
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,500
And...

605
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,260
you're gonna -- you're gonna beat this thing.

606
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,530
Your immunoglobulins are normal.

607
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,130
Everything is normal.

608
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,950
We can't find a scientific explanation.

609
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,580
Our prayers... it's a miracle.

610
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,310
Miracle or not,

611
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,800
it seems we're on the same page now.

612
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,570
There is no reason not to do the spinal fusion

613
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,050
to eliminate your pain.

614
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,230
Do more tests.

615
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,830
- Clarence. - There are no more tests.

616
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,440
T-t-there must be. There must be an explanation.

617
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,150
Redo your tests. Find new tests.

618
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,950
"Let all bitterness and wrath

619
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,130
and anger and clamor and slander

620
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,660
be put away from you."

621
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,830
Ephesians 4:31.

622
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,390
I didn't take you for a believer.

623
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,960
I'm not, anymore.

624
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,170
I'm not sure you are either.

625
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,780
God speaks directly to Noah,

626
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,850
Moses, Job, and Solomon.

627
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,200
And now apparently He has singled out

628
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,080
Pastor Clarence of San Jose

629
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,070
to join the ranks of the prophets.

630
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,500
I'm sorry, but unless there is a burning bush

631
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,010
it is narcissistic to think that God

632
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,470
has made you his personal project.

633
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,290
God speaks to every one of us,

634
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,620
- you just have to listen. - You are not listening.

635
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,880
People get cancer all the time.

636
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,440
Often that results in pain.

637
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,980
Those things are not unique.

638
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,630
What is unique

639
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,320
is having an aggressive metastatic cancer

640
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,760
start to disappear without any rational explanation.

641
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,850
The issue isn't God.

642
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,520
You have to forgive yourself.

643
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,830
What I did --

644
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,070
Cannot be undone.

645
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,700
But your pain can.

646
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,790
Clarence.

647
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,500
Your pain...

648
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,220
Your pain does no one any good.

649
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,270
Okay.

650
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,520
Osteotome and mallet.

651
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,720
You lied when you said you never went to church.

652
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,160
- What happened? - I didn't want to have this conversation

653
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,180
- is what happened. - I'm not judging.

654
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,890
My brother took a year off school to travel

655
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,370
and came back a non-believer.

656
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,830
So ask him.

657
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,070
Was it freeing,

658
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,240
or did you feel empty?

659
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,600
Hand me the first polyaxial pedicle screw.

660
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,020
It was like losing a loved one.

661
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,420
The moment of truth.

662
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,100
Follow me.

663
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,950
Our initial diagnosis was wrong.

664
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,800
You don't have a meningioma.

665
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,500
You have a worm in your brain.

666
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,420
And while that sounds fairly gross,

667
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,880
it is completely curable.

668
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,930
So, the sense of doom, it was -- it was wrong?

669
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,100
- It saved your life. - As did Dr. Murphy.

670
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,600
This is the pathologist who noticed an abnormality in one of your tests.

671
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,900
That led us to this discovery.

672
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,700
Can I give you a hug, too, Dr. Murphy?

673
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,820
No.

674
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,090
You and your sister will be free to conquer

675
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,720
whichever of the remaining 50 peaks you choose

676
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,380
as soon as my team surgically removes the worm.

677
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,260
- Thank you. - Oh! Of course.

678
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,900
There are not a lot of doctors who would have made the leap

679
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,350
that you made today, Shaun.

680
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,020
Good work.

681
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:07,480
Yes, it was excellent work.

682
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,670
Most people would say "thank you,"

683
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,780
but technically that's not an incorrect response.

684
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,280
Have a good evening. You've earned it.

685
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,750
I don't want to go on walks.

686
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,810
I don't want to move on from cases

687
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,260
after the tests are done.

688
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:40,220
I do not want to be a pathologist.

689
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,440
Dr. Han, you need to make me a surgical resident again.

690
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,570
I appreciate you telling me that.

691
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,470
I was wondering whether you had it in you

692
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,990
to advocate for yourself.

693
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,170
But the truth is, Shaun,

694
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,000
what you did today,

695
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,590
it proved I'm right.

696
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,630
Your skills are tremendous.

697
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,380
Your weaknesses...

698
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,430
equally significant.

699
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,640
You could be a great pathologist.

700
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,410
Just think of all the Sadies out there,

701
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,270
waiting for you to save them.

702
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,470
Dr. Browne, Dr. Reznick.

703
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,390
The surgery went well. Your spine is stable.

704
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,350
I'm scared.

705
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,040
There may still be some residual pain as you heal, but --

706
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,810
No, I...

707
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,690
I keep wondering,

708
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,400
what if I disobeyed God?

709
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,620
You have to have faith.

710
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,040
But you lost yours.

711
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,750
I didn't have a miracle to help me through the dark times.
