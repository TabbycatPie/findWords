1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,180
我也为你生气  戴安
I'm mad for you, Diane.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,780
罗杰这么快就重返情场了吗
Roger's dating already?

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,410
天啊  我好好奇她是不是比他年轻
OMG, I wonder if she's younger than him.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,870
请稍等
You hold on a second.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,140
罗琳  我最爱的客户过得如何呀
Lorraine, how's my favorite client?

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,010
我最近的事业红得发紫
I've been on something of a hot streak at work.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,320
我接了一大堆新客户
I've tapped into a rich vein of new clients --

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,220
都是刚离婚的妈妈们
recently divorced moms.

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,970
你可以说我挖到了"单亲妈妈矿"
You might say I hit the single-mother lode.

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,510
主卧室合你心意吗
How about that master suite, huh?

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,470
要是有人共享就好了
Maybe if I had someone to share it with.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,000
罗琳  你风韵犹存  是抢手的高价货
Lorraine, you are a beautiful woman with a lot to offer.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,530
要给这房子也出个价吗
Should we make an offer?

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,970
房子是很棒  可惜我单身一人
It's a great house, but I'm just gonna be alone.

15
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,160
戴安  你怎么会单身一人
Diane, you're not gonna be alone.

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,010
你只需要贷一个款
You're gonna get a loan.

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,760
拿着苏打  零食  我们去地下室玩牌
Sodas, snacks -- poker game's in the basement.

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,460
我比你更需要睡眠
Look, I need more sleep than you,

19
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,880
但自从他们把那颗梅树砍了
and ever since they cut down that stupid prune tree,

20
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,980
每天早晨阳光就会照得我睡不着
the sun has been right in my eyes every morning.

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,210
不是梅树  是他们在修枝剪叶
It's not a prune tree. They pruned the tree.

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,210
[Prune:梅子/修剪]

23
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,590
我是不会和你换床的
And I'm not switching places with you,

24
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,770
你下次掉个头睡就行了
so you should just put your head at the other end of the bed.

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,880
什么啊  要我的脚枕着枕头睡吗
Uh, why? So my feet get the pillow?

26
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,150
竟然还说我傻
And I'm the dumb one.

27
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,970
戴安  你不能老想着他
Diane, you have got to forget about him.

28
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,070
罗杰现在是夏安的问题了
Roger's Cheyenne's problem now.

29
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,290
-亲爱的  -知道吗
- Honey... - You know what?

30
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,990
你需要找人倾诉
You need to talk.

31
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,220
一起去星巴克喝杯饮料吧
Starbucks for a little go juice?

32
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,310
怎么啦
What is up?

33
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,280
我得去一趟办公室
I need to go into the office.

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,000
我爸叫我把月记录总结好[月事]
My dad wants me to close out the monthly.

35
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,440
怎么了
What?

36
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,030
月事  没事  你继续
Monthly. Never mind. Go on.

37
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,690
我今天会很累  所以需要你
I'm stretched a little thin today, so I need you

38
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,560
去买点杂货  照顾一下孩子
to do the grocery shopping, check in on the kids,

39
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
或许再顺便把前院的树枝清理了
and maybe clean up those branches in the front yard.

40
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,100
放心加放心
Done and done.

41
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,910
这是个词组
Is that an expression,

42
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,210
还是你真的只记住了我刚才说过的两件事
or did you really only remember two of the things I said?

43
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,350
-后者  -我会给你语音留言备忘的
- The second. - I'll leave you a message.

44
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,190
你好啊
Hello?

45
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:32,980

00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,220

第五季 第三集

60
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,750
我有坏消息  杰
I have bad news, Jay.

61
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,400
乔被赶出金宝贝乐园了
Joe was thrown out of the gymboree.

62
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,740
又被赶出来了  出什么事了
Again? What happened?

63
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,570
他推倒了梅森  把他弄哭了
He pushed Mason. He made him cry.

64
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,260
老师说不准我们再去
The teacher said that we cannot go back.

65
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,050
太荒谬了  梅森是大孩子了
That's ridiculous. Mason's a big baby.

66
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,120
去那里玩的都是大孩子
Everybody there is a big baby.

67
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,150
但乔玩的时候很凶
But Joe plays very rough.

68
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,270
原因我们都知道  是诅咒
And we know why. It's the curse.

69
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,840
虽然我从来不反对你小点声说话
Not that I'd ever want to discourage you from whispering,

70
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,450
但根本没有诅咒这回事
but that's not a thing.

71
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,240
我的家族有恶魔诅咒
There is a mark of the devil in my family.

72
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,110
我的曾曾祖父
My great-great grandfather

73
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,040
得到了翡翠矿址
was given the location of an emerald mine

74
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,090
却换走了他的灵魂
in exchange for his soul.

75
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,590
有文件之类的记录此事吗
There's, like, paperwork or something that proves this?

76
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,900
他们说在他女儿的婚礼上
And they say that the day of his daughter's wedding,

77
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,860
一只大鸟从天而降
a great bird came from the sky

78
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,950
用爪子一把抓住他
and snatched him with his claws

79
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,170
把他带到遥远的地方去了
and took him far, far away.

80
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,710
你知道你讲过的许多故事的结局
You're aware that a remarkable number of your stories end

81
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,190
都是某个家庭成员被大鸟抓走吧
with a family member being carried off by a giant bird.

82
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,740
他们确实是这样告诉我的  杰
I only know what I was told, Jay.

83
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,360
我只是说如果那种事发生超过三次
I'm just saying after the third time,

84
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,420
我们应该以后举办室内聚会
we might think about moving the party inside.

85
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,640
好吧  也许不是诅咒
Okay, maybe it's not the curse,

86
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,320
但你知道我的家族是有黑暗面的
but you know that my family has a very dark side.

87
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,620
我的表亲奥雷利奥是个偷马贼
My cousin Aurelio is a horse thief.

88
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,390
我叔叔卡洛斯幕后操控足球赛  我阿姨
My uncle Carlos fixed soccer games. My aunt --

89
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,710
他是教他们把球捡起来
Did he teach them to pick the ball up

90
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,680
用手扔到场地里吗
and throw it down the field?

91
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,230
因为只有那样才能操控足球
'Cause that's the only way you fix soccer.

92
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,240
曼尼逃脱了诅咒  但乔我就不知道了
Manny escaped it, but I am not sure about Joe.

93
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,870
歌洛莉亚  是老师太紧张了
Gloria, this is about an uptight teacher.

94
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,960
就算乔有点调皮又怎样
And so what if Joe's a little boisterous?

95
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,910
不是一直都说要让孩子保留真实的风格吗
Whatever happened to letting kids be themselves?

96
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,670
-我准备好了  -把帽子摘了
- Ready. - Lose the hat.

97
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,040
看来我看《音乐之声》都要戴普通帽子了
I guess I'm supposed to see "Sound of Music" in a regular hat.

98
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,250
我不反对《音乐之声》
Nothing against "Sound of Music,"

99
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,340
但今天下午
but there's a lot of other things

100
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,500
我们可以做很多其他事
we could do this afternoon.

101
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,550
你听说过《猛龙怪客》吗[1974年电影]
You ever hear of "Death Wish"?

102
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,180
我喜欢"死亡之愿"
Oh, I love "Death Wish."

103
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,040
曼尼  那是有病的孩子参加的慈善活动
Manny, that's the charity where the sick kids go to,

104
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
比如去麦当娜的音乐会
like, a concert with Madonna

105
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,480
或者和贾斯丁・比伯看超级杯  或者
or to the super bowl with Justin Bieber, or they --

106
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,020
不不不
No, no, no, no, no.

107
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,710
我说的是电影  70年代的
It's a movie -- New York, '70s,

108
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,510
查尔斯・布朗森扮演一个顾家的好男人
Charles Bronson's a firm family man, and he...

109
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,530
但被逼到绝境
Who's pushed to the limit

110
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,360
于是他决定作出反击
until one day he decides to fight back.

111
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,100
-你看过  -片名是《猛龙怪客》这么明显
- You've seen it? - It's called "Death Wish."

112
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,680
我猜结局就是他在公寓里
I doubt it ends with him trading banter

113
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,790
和玛莎・梅森互相调侃
in an apartment with Marsha Mason.

114
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,430
你好啊  未婚夫
Hey, fiance?

115
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,810
你好  我的亲夫
Hello, my intended.

116
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,980
那听起来像是在说"谋杀亲夫"
That one sounds a little murdery.

117
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,080
你就是我的亲夫啊
You are my intended.

118
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,530
别说了  别这样
Stop it. Stop it!

119
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,490
你出去的时候
So, while you're out,

120
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,850
我会重新看一下选什么花
I'm gonna review our flower options,

121
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,480
目前为止我很中意"福劳莱与哈代"花店
and I have to say, so far, i'm partial to Floral and Hardy,

122
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,480
[与著名喜剧《劳莱与哈代》谐音]

123
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,180
但我还要最后看一眼"阿甘花店"的花
but I'm gonna give one last look at Florist Gump.

124
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,180
[与名电影《阿甘正传》谐音]

125
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,860
你就喜欢选名字起得好的
You love a business with a clever name.

126
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,720
确实  被你发现了
I do. Guilty.

127
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,370
我真是太喜欢现在的状态了
Can I just say I love how this is going?

128
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,810
米奇尔和我一致同意
Mitchell and I agreed

129
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,760
由我来操办婚礼事宜
that I would be in charge of the wedding

130
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,520
上周我们才听说安迪家的悲剧
after the tragic news last week from the Andys.

131
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,800
不是指那条山脉[安第斯山]
Uh, not the mountain range. No.

132
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,170
我们的朋友安德鲁和安德鲁
Our friends Andrew and Andrew --

133
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:11,870
他们分手了
they broke up.

134
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,410
筹划婚礼的压力太大
The stress of planning a wedding was too much.

135
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,820
他们互相吹毛求疵  争论
They were quibbling about...

136
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,320
每一件事
Everything.

137
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,270
所以我很乐意
I mean, uh, which is why I'm just happy

138
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,210
放任他去发挥
to stay out of his way.

139
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,490
对  我构思远大  然后再精简
Yeah, I dream big. Then I winnow down.

140
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,050
构思远大  再精简
Dream big. Winnow down.

141
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,230
-构思远大  -好了  放下来
- Dream big. - Okay, winnow down.

142
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,070
没错  别挡着我  抱歉
Yep. Stay out of my way. Sorry.

143
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,910
二爸  拉里哪去了
Daddy, where's Larry?

144
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,460
亲爱的  你知道猫总爱瞎跑的
Oh, well, you know how cats are, sweetie.

145
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,140
他们是  流浪之神
They're -- they're wanderers.

146
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,350
但我都好几天没见着他了
But I haven't seen him in days.

147
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,420
没事  他会回家的  好吗
Well, he'll be back, okay?

148
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,650
这事你得信我
Trust daddy on this.

149
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,670
好吧
Okay.

150
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,360
我有点担心
You know, I'm starting to get worried

151
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,600
拉里可能不会回来了
that Larry might not come back.

152
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,460
-一定已经死了  -什么
- Oh, he's definitely dead. - What?!

153
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,890
不是横尸街头就是已入狼口了
Yeah, street meat or coyote chow.

154
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,290
我们再等几周  再弄只新的
We'll wait a couple weeks, and then we'll get a new Larry.

155
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,970
你对我们宠物的生死有点冷漠啊
Uh, you're pretty nonchalant about our family pet dying.

156
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,320
我们难道不应该帮助闺女度过这一关吗
And shouldn't we help our daughter process this loss?

157
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,480
应该  应该  她会没事的
Yes, we will, and she'll be fine.

158
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,630
我也不是冷漠
And it's not nonchalant.

159
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,130
农场生活就这样  动物死亡很正常
It's farm life. Death is everywhere.

160
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,300
别对他们投入太多情感就行了
You just learn to not get too attached to anything.

161
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,560
这么说  要是我死了
Oh, so, what, if I were to die,

162
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,040
你就等几周然后找个人取代我吗
you would just wait a few weeks and then replace me?

163
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,620
别说傻话
Of course not.

164
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,730
我上哪儿去找一个跟你
Where would I find another gay Mitchell

165
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,260
一模一样的同性恋米奇尔呢
with your exact markings?

166
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,770
大艾艾  干嘛呢
What's happening, big Al?

167
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,780
再管我叫那名字试试看
Yeah, let's go ahead and veto that nickname.

168
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,600
罗本教会我一个特棒的把戏
Hey, Reuben taught me this cool trick.

169
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,660
眼睛闭上
Close your eyes.

170
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,230
我的天  你们什么毛病啊
Oh, my god! What is wrong with you?

171
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,970
妹子让你亲了  现在谁也不欠谁
You kissed a girl. Now we're even.

172
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,380
我打扑克牌输给他了
Just paying off a poker debt.

173
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,200
卢克的变态朋友刚刚强吻了我
Luke's creepy friend just kissed me.

174
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,410
好恶  罗本吗  那个小怪胎吗
Ew. Reuben? That little weirdo?

175
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,260
我还在这呢
I'm still here.

176
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,850
我得把嘴放开水里消消毒
I'm gonna go boil my mouth.

177
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,970
兄弟们  去楼下玩游戏
Oh, hey, guys. Game's downstairs.

178
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,700
你们这些笨蛋玩的游戏
This little game you dorks play,

179
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,340
赌注到底大不大
we talking milk money or heavy cream?

180
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,340
好些刚收的成人礼礼金呢
A lot of fresh bar mitzvah money down there.

181
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,310
我能参加吗
Mind if I sit in?

182
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,450
我们有规定不能带女的
We kind of got a no-girls policy.

183
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,740
是规定还是根本没姑娘要跟你们玩
Is it a policy or just something that keeps happening?

184
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,050
后者啦
The second.

185
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,880
亲爱的  怎么了
Hey, honey.

186
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,380
我激动得都不能自已了
I am so excited I can't stand it!

187
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,760
你那手要是再那么扑腾
If you're gonna move your hands around like that,

188
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,900
还是先把电话放下  别摔了
you need to put the phone down.

189
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,010
好的  好的  好的
Okay, okay, okay.

190
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,890
餐前鸡尾酒会的部分
For cocktail hour,

191
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,100
他们在为我们设计一座人造瀑布
they're creating a running waterfall

192
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,830
我们两个拥抱的全息影像
onto which they're going to project

193
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,240
会被投影到瀑布上面
a hologram of us embracing.

194
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,890
但我们还是要注重简化  对吧
But we're still winnowing, right?

195
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,800
那已经很精简了
Already winnowed.

196
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,500
我舍弃了天使装呢
I cut the angel costumes.

197
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,890
好难抉择的  米奇尔
Hard choices, Mitchell.

198
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,830
好的  我得挂了  太激动啦
Okay, I got to go. I'm so excited!

199
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,580
好吧  我也是
Yeah, me too.

200
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,990
我和小卡恋爱最棒的地方在于什么
Best thing about my relationship with Cam?

201
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,590
在于信任
Trust.

202
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,840
快讯一则  我强迫症犯起来也不是人
Newsflash -- I can be an obsessive person.

203
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,840
在以前  我根本没法放手让别人
In the past, I've had trouble letting someone else

204
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,000
做决定
call the shots.

205
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,640
把大权拱手让人实在令我抓狂
Giving up control made me crazy.

206
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,600
那也是我跟小卡相处得如此轻松的原因
That's what makes my life with Cam so freeing.

207
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,040
我能把大事交由他处理
I can turn over big things to him

208
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,220
然后自己不再去担心
and never give them a second thought.

209
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,780
眼不见  心不烦  拜拜了您
Out of sight, out of mind. Bye-bye.

210
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,770
菲尔
Phil.

211
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,020
这也
This is --

212
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,370
我的天啊
Oh! Oh, my god!

213
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,350
菲尔
Phil?

214
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,120
-菲尔你在吗  -我就坐那儿
- Phil?! - Yeah, I was just sitting there,

215
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,530
他就猥亵我了
and he basically molested me.

216
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,690
你说什么
Excuse me?

217
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,230
她说的是罗本
She's talking about Reuben.

218
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,980
你又是谁
Who are you?!

219
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,020
你们男的最好把钱带够了
You boys better have money.

220
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,620
不给钱姐可不干
I am not doing this for free.

221
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,350
你们  你们要干嘛
W-w-what's -- what's happening?

222
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,420
我听明白了  乔伊斯
Oh, I hear you, Joyce.

223
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,100
他的时间宝贵  你的就不宝贵  是吧
His time's important. Your time isn't, right?

224
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,570
一会打给你  超级巨星
Let me buzz you back, superstar.

225
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,470
好嘞
Okay.

226
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,150
亲爱的
Hey, honey.

227
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,440
前院的树枝还在那
Branches are still in the front yard,

228
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,770
我脸都被弹肿了
I just took a rake to the face,

229
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,720
罗本对艾丽克斯有奇怪的企图
Reuben is getting really weird on Alex,

230
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,620
海莉为了钱在地下室不知做什么呢
And Haley's doing something for money in the basement.

231
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,750
没什么大不了啦
It's all gonna be fine.

232
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,150
老爸回来了  超级巨星
Daddy's home, superstar.

233
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,410
别  别那么叫我
No. Don't call me that.

234
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,570
我跟那些粘人的离婚妇女不一样
I'm not one of your needy little divorces.

235
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,840
那是我的工作而已
Um, that is work.

236
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,710
是吗
Is it?

237
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,880
因为我觉得你都爱上
'Cause I kind of feel like part of you loves

238
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,110
充当这些女人的英雄了
being a hero to those women.

239
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,750
我是在帮助她们
I'm a helper of people.

240
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,640
你当初追我这个房产中介的时候
Hey, you knew what you signed up for

241
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,030
就应当料到会有这些后果了
when you hitched your wagon to a realtor man.

242
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,050
亲爱的  我们认识时
Honey, when I met you,

243
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,620
你还是个婚礼DJ
you were a wedding deejay.

244
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,080
顺便说一句  DJ先生
By the way, Spinderfella,

245
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,120
看样子你还得去趟杂货店
looks like you still need to hit the grocery store.

246
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,860
我觉得某人感到被冷落了
I think someone's feeling neglected.

247
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,520
没错  我跟很多寂寞妇女打交道
Yes, I deal with a lot of lonely women,

248
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,870
但我娶了的寂寞妇女只有你一个
but there's only one I'm married to.

249
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,100
你有点忘乎所以了  菲尔
You're getting too involved, Phil.

250
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,620
你在哄骗这些女人
You are juggling these women,

251
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,440
而你水平其实很有限
and you're not that good a juggler.

252
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,190
你是在说气话
Now you're just lashing out!

253
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,750
来这边
Hey, come here.

254
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,460
我没告诉杰
I didn't tell Jay,

255
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,060
但有时候连我自己都害怕乔
but sometimes Joe even scares me.

256
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,430
万幸的是  有专业人士
Lucky for me, there are professionals

257
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,550
来帮我解决这些问题
that are trained to deal with such problems.

258
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,340
您好  谢谢您过来  神父
Ay, thank you for coming, padre.

259
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,750
小事一桩  歌洛莉亚
Oh, of course, Gloria.

260
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,080
这肯定是弗汉希欧啦
And this must be Fulgencio.

261
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,200
小伙子真帅呀
What a beautiful little boy.

262
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,160
他天性纯良
He's such a sweet nature.

263
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,570
我能看得出他本性善良
I can tell he's a gentle soul.

264
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,280
弗汉希欧  松手  松手
Ah! Hey, Fulgencio, no, no.

265
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,030
抱歉  神父
Sorry, padre.

266
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,910
这也正是我找您来的原因
Ay, that's why I called you, Father.

267
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,040
我觉得这个孩子很坏
I think he's bad.

268
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,810
我的家族有恶魔诅咒
There is evil in my family.

269
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,340
歌洛莉亚  他还只是个婴儿呢
Ah, Gloria, he's just a little baby.

270
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,390
上礼拜  他眼睛变红了
Last week, his eyes got red,

271
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,040
连狗都被他吓跑了
and the dog backed away.

272
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,020
他可能只是感冒了而已
He probably just had a cold.

273
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,700
每个妈妈都喜欢担心
All mothers worry.

274
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,360
你看他  气色红润  乖乖地玩积木呢
Look at him -- rosy cheeks, he's playing with his blocks.

275
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,780
又是六
The six again.

276
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,050
因为乔推到了一个小孩  就把他开除
So, Joe knocks one kid down, he's out.

277
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,430
小孩子都这样
All kids do that.

278
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,990
不然你那整栋楼怎么都是防撞材料造的
Why do you think your whole building is made out of nerf?

279
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,000
是啊  你现在知道我小孩的脾气随谁了
Yeah, you see where he gets it from.

280
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,760
听着  我可不怕你  黛比老师
Hey, listen, I'm not afraid of you, Miss Debbie.

281
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,630
你不是...该死
You're not the -- damn it.

282
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,220
看来某人该去纳粹占领的奥地利
Sounds like someone needs a relaxing trip

283
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,520
来个放松之旅了
to nazi-occupied Austria.

284
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,730
她居然挂我电话
Can't believe she hung up on me.

285
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,800
谁让你冲着人家吼来着
Well, you were yelling at her.

286
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,490
我这是坚持原则  是不同的
Standing up for yourself is not the same thing as, uh --

287
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,420
你等会
Excuse me.

288
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,930
算了吧  杰
Uh, come on, Jay.

289
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,880
你家没家教的
So no one ever taught you manners, huh?

290
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,660
你想怎样
Whatever, dude.

291
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,930
你撞了人就应该道歉
No, you bump into somebody, you apologize.

292
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,410
既然我都要给你上一课了
And since I'm teaching you something here,

293
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,350
就先从"好好穿裤子"开始吧
here's a little class called "Intro to pants."

294
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,240
杰  住手
Jay, stop!

295
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,240
放开我
Get off me!

296
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,920
我和那些孩子是同校生
I go to school with those kids.

297
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,000
你知不知道你这样多丢人
You know how embarrassing that was?

298
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,230
-曼尼  -别说了
- Manny. - No.

299
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,140
你为什么老是这样
Why do you always got to be like this --

300
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,250
爱评判别人  脾气爆  还大嗓门
judgmental, hot-tempered, loud?

301
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,060
这些都是我最讨厌的事
These are a few of my least-favorite things.

302
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,840
菲尔・邓菲  房源出售

303
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,780
我看得出你跟这房子有缘  戴安
Well, I can see that the house speaks to you, Diane.

304
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,720
"买下我吧"
"Buy me."

305
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,290
现在还不行
Not now, house.

306
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,770
开放式的布局  宽敞的厨房  多好
Ah, the open floor plan, the spacious kitchen.

307
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,970
我确实很喜欢
I do love it.

308
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,620
是我办公室打来的
That's -- that's the office.

309
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,480
我何不再去后院最后看上一眼呢
Why don't you take one last look at the backyard?

310
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,690
有没有想到"露天烧烤"
Did someone say barbecue?

311
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,710
我有哦
"I did."

312
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,520
罗琳  怎么了
Lorraine, what is up?

313
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,460
没忙什么呀  就在办公室呗
Nothing. Just kicking it at the office.

314
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,240
慢点慢点
Slow down, now.

315
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,710
有什么事跟菲尔说
Tell Phil what happened.

316
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,060
菲尔  我能不能去车库看看
Phil, can I go in the garage?

317
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,100
你就把这当自己家  随意  妹妹
Make yourself at home, sister.

318
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,470
刚才是我妹妹  她来看我
That was my sister who is visiting town

319
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,300
顺便看看我办公室
-- and my office,

320
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,960
我就是从办公室打给你的
which is where I am calling you from.

321
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,060
是你打给我的
You called me.

322
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,680
我很担心拉里
I'm worried about Larry.

323
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,090
宝贝儿  我知道
Oh, honey, I know.

324
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,070
他去哪了
Where is he?

325
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,950
莉莉  有件事也许我该告诉你
Um, Lily, there's probably something I should tell you.

326
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,820
拉里不会回来了
Larry's not coming back home.

327
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,700
为什么  他死了吗
Why? Is he dead?

328
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,290
不  他没死
Nope. Um, not dead.

329
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,420
拉里遇到了意中人
Larry, uh, met someone, fell in love,

330
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,990
结婚了
and he got married.

331
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,290
他们会来探望我们吗
Are they ever going to visit?

332
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,270
恐怕不会  因为当猫结婚以后
I'm afraid not because when cats get married,

333
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,080
他们就必须搬去树林里
they have to move to, um, the forest,

334
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,660
这样就不会受到城市里其它猫的诱惑
and so then they're not tempted by other cats in the city.

335
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,280
-那是拉里呀  -我知道
- It's Larry. - I know.

336
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,000
就算是你平时认为坚强的人
Even people that you would never expect

337
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,960
-也会有软弱的时候  -不  在那
- have moments of weakness. - No, over there.

338
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,550
可是他妻子呢
But where's his wife?

339
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,310
你好  拉里
Hello, Larry.

340
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,600
拉里回来了
Larry's back.

341
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,830
你知道吗
Yeah, uh, well, you know what?

342
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,920
我猜他俩可能不合适
I think they probably, uh, didn't work out,

343
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,910
于是就分手了
and they broke up.

344
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,500
结婚了以后还能分手吗
People get married and then break up?

345
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,490
要是你和爸爸也分手呢
What if that happens to you and daddy?

346
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,610
你知道吗  是爸爸搞错了
Oh, y-you know what? Daddy made a mistake.

347
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,420
拉里和他的妻子没有分手
Uh, Larry and his wife didn't break up.

348
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,510
拉里的妻子  去世了
Larry's wife...died.

349
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,020
不是吧
Oh, no.

350
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,780
是啊
Yeah.

351
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,560
所以我们要给拉里一个了结
That's why we're gonna give him the closure he needs

352
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,070
我们要给他的妻子
by throwing, um, a funeral

353
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,980
举行一场葬礼来纪念她精彩的一生
to celebrate the remarkable life of Larry's wife.

354
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,420
葬礼会很棒的  你知道吗
It's gonna be great. You know what?

355
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,650
我们会准备现场音乐  还有鞋盒
We're gonna have music, we're gonna get a shoe box...

356
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,880
还有蜡烛
...we're gonna have candles.

357
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,200
喂  阿甘花店  又是我
Yes. Hi, Florist Gump. It's me again.

358
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,360
独自解决这个危机的感觉真好
It felt good to handle that crisis on my own.

359
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,520
在过去  我肯定第一时间找米奇尔求助
In the past, I would have had to run to Mitchell,

360
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,120
但是他现在越来越信任我了
but he's been trusting me more and more.

361
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,030
我真为他骄傲
I'm so proud of him.

362
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,430
他真的学会了放手
He's really learned to let things go.

363
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,190
不  天啊  不  不  不
Oh, no! God, no, no, no!

364
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,810
干吗
What?

365
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,220
我们在楼下被血洗了
It's a bloodbath down there.

366
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,400
输得分文不剩
We lost everything.

367
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,410
你不是很厉害吗
I thought you were good.

368
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,890
我总是能赢迪兰呀
I always beat Dylan.

369
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,040
求你了  我们需要你
Come on. We need your help.

370
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,570
你是家里扑克打得最好的人了
You're the best card player in this family.

371
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,630
我有什么好处
What's in it for me?

372
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,100
-一个做好姐姐的机会  -免了
- A chance to be a good sister. - Pass.

373
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,410
罗本到处跟别人说
Reuben's been telling everyone

374
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,590
你主动跟他舌吻
you slipped him the tongue.

375
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,400
让开
Move.

376
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,100
猫不是有九条命吗
I thought cats had nine lives.

377
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,790
是啊  的确如此
Yeah, and they do,

378
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,560
但拉里的妻子比他年长
but Larry's wife was older than he was,

379
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,850
而且她已经结过八次婚了
and she'd been married eight times before.

380
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,220
就像伊丽莎白・泰勒那样吗
Like Elizabeth Taylor?

381
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,470
你记得我给你讲的睡前故事
Oh, you remember our bedtime stories.

382
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,760
迪兰  谢谢你这么快赶来
Oh, Dylan, thank you for coming on such short notice.

383
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,430
我需要你在这边挖个洞
I just need you to dig a hole right over here.

384
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,950
-谢谢  -没问题
- Thank you. - Oh, no problem.

385
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,190
莉莉  请节哀顺变
So, Lily, I'm really sorry.

386
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,090
拉里还好吗
How's Larry doing?

387
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,710
很好  他是只快乐的小猫
Fine. He's a happy cat.

388
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,540
原来是猫啊
Oh, they're cats.

389
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,080
这下我的工作就轻松多了
That's gonna make my job a lot easier.

390
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,630
好了  各位  感谢你们前来
Okay, everyone, thank you for coming.

391
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,530
这对莉莉很重要  对我也很重要
It means a lot to Lily, and it means a lot to me.

392
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,620
安格斯
Angus?

393
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,240
关于拉里的爱妻  我该说些什么呢
So, Larry's wife -- what can I say?

394
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,760
她很爱拉里
She loved Larry.

395
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,220
和天下所有猫夫妻一样
And, um, you know, like all cat marriages,

396
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,830
他们经历了起起落落
they had their ups and their downs,

397
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,320
但他们都一同挺了过来
but they always landed on their feet.

398
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,160
凿到石头了
Oh, hit a rock.

399
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,230
不是石头
Oh! Not a rock!

400
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,060
各位
Okay, everybody!

401
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,090
请保持冷静  保持冷静
Please stay calm! Please stay calm!

402
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,490
别乱跑  地很滑
No running! It's slippery!

403
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,940
安格斯  继续演奏
Angus, keep playing!

404
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,700
好
Okay.

405
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,900
-兰德尔  -怎么了
- Randall! - Yeah?

406
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,210
我在上面
I'm up here.

407
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,580
普里契特先生吗
Mr. Pritchett?

408
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,680
这都是实习工作的相关文件
This is all intern work.

409
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,050
不是为我的乐队打印的
It isn't for my band.

410
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,970
需要我去帮忙买咖啡吗
Need me to do a coffee run?

411
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,100
不
No.

412
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,380
不是  听我说  我刚刚在打扫
No, uh, listen, I was -- I was cleaning,

413
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,220
然后被卡在这上面了
and I got stuck up here,

414
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,780
我需要你去我的办公室
and I need you to go into my office

415
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,750
把倒下的梯子扶起来
and stand up the ladder that fell.

416
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,680
好的
Got it.

417
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,490
抱歉我刚刚撒了谎
And I'm sorry about lying before.

418
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,020
这是我们乐队的宣传单
Those are flyers for my band,

419
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,150
叫"实习生乐队"
the Interns.

420
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,090
你的门是锁着的
Uh-oh. Your door's locked.

421
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,250
糟糕
Oh, no.

422
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,770
但如果你可以向前挪一点
But, hey, I-I think, if you keep going forward,

423
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,380
然后转身把腿从通风口伸下来
then back your legs out through the vent,

424
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,300
我想我可以抓住你的腿把你扶下来
I can grab them to help you down.

425
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,430
我不确定
Oh, I don't know.

426
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,600
这让我有点紧张
That makes me a little nervous.

427
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,120
想想别的事情
Just think about something else.

428
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,050
我听说你要结婚了  进行得怎么样了
I heard you're getting married. How's that going?

429
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,460
是啊是啊
Oh, yeah, yeah.

430
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,730
还不错  不错
It's -- it's good. It's good.

431
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,840
我们正在策划婚礼
You know, we're planning it right now.

432
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,200
实际上  是有人在为我策划
Actually, it's being planned for me.

433
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,930
不错啊  毫无压力
That's nice. No stress.

434
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,080
本该是这样  对吧
Oh, you'd think, huh?

435
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,590
但事情有些失控了
But it's getting a little bit out of hand.

436
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,250
策划婚礼总是这样的
Oh, that happens with weddings.

437
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,100
是吗
Does it?

438
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,010
你去过几个婚礼上是有
I mean, how many weddings have you been to

439
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,170
"鸽子发射器"这种东西的
that have something called a dove cannon?

440
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,260
我觉得在这种事情上
You know, I think I should have a say

441
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,470
我应该也有话语权的
in something like that.

442
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,090
你得放手了  普里契特先生
You need to let go, Mr. Pritchett.

443
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,370
我做不到
I-I can't.

444
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,740
我希望我能做到  不我不能
I-I wish I could, but I can't.

445
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,250
我...这太让我抓狂了
I just -- it's freaking me out.

446
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,840
不  我是说我扶住你了
No, I've got you already.

447
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,060
好吧
Okay.

448
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,170
好
Yeah.

449
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,690
谢谢
Thank you.

450
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,400
我很善于理解别人的想法
You know, I'm pretty good at reading people,

451
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,830
听起来您和您太太真的需要
and it sounds like you and your lady

452
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,510
通过沟通来解决问题
really need to talk this out.

453
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,690
是啊  也许你说得对
Yeah, maybe you're right.

454
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,120
我告诉你一个小秘密吧
So I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

455
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,870
-我是同性恋  -天哪
- I'm gay. - Oh, my god.

456
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,710
她知道吗
Does she know?

457
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,430
得给新婚之夜留点惊喜不是吗
Got to save something for the wedding night, huh?

458
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,190
好了
Okay.

459
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,690
莱利  别这样  巴斯特  快坐下
Riley, no! Buster, please sit!

460
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,330
迪兰  来帮忙
Dylan, help!

461
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,620
我帮不了
I can't!

462
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,470
这些猫猫狗狗打得不可开交
These cats and dogs are fighting like -- oh!

463
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,690
好了  各位  很抱歉
Okay, everybody, I'm sorry.

464
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,900
这本该是一场小型仪式
This was supposed to be a small service,

465
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,610
但我没有控制好自己
but I don't winnow down.

466
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,780
我做得过火了
I overdo.

467
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,650
要是我连给猫办场假葬礼都做不好
And if I let a simple fake cat funeral get out of hand,

468
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,110
我要怎么才能办好整场婚礼呢
how am I supposed to plan an entire wedding?

469
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,340
你们迟到了
You're late.

470
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,250
我需要我家米奇尔
Okay, I need Mitchell.

471
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,020
好消息
Good news.

472
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,140
他刚停下车
He just pulled up.

473
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,450
该死
Damn it.

474
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,160
好  进来  快进来
Okay, in. In, in.

475
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,120
好  好
Yes. Okay.

476
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,940
能来个人把那东西抓住吗  拜托了
And, please, can somebody catch that thing?

477
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,270
好  好的  都留下
Okay, all right, stay.

478
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,400
各位...
Everyone just...

479
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,910
去健身感觉怎么样
Hey! How was the gym?

480
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,220
我没去成
I never made it.

481
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,550
小卡  有些事我得跟你谈谈
Listen, Cam, I got to talk about something.

482
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,540
我也是
I do, too.

483
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,930
你想不想参与到婚礼的策划中来
What would you think about being more involved with the wedding?

484
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,440
这正是我要谈的事
That's what I wanted to talk about.

485
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,450
我很乐意
I would love to.

486
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,090
谢天谢地
Thank god.

487
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,230
我就是觉得我们...我们一起会更好
You know, I just think we're -- we're better together.

488
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,050
"一起会更好"  我喜欢这说法
"Better together." Mm, I like that.

489
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,610
我无法和蛇同处一室
I cannot be in a house with snakes.

490
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,010
有多糟
How bad is it?

491
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,290
大概需要一个小时清理现场
Gonna need about an hour.

492
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,260
给你
Here you go.

493
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,110
我给你买了"雪顶"巧克力
I got you Sno-caps,

494
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,760
因为最后他们成功穿越阿尔卑斯雪山逃跑了
'cause, you know, at the end, they escape across the alps.

495
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,070
感谢剧透
Thanks for ruining it.

496
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,370
淡定点  这电影都出了五十年了
Calm down. The movie's 50 years old.

497
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,580
你真是处处"交友"啊
Making friends everywhere, aren't you?

498
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,220
你总是说  "要表达出你的感情"
Listen, you always say, "Express your feelings."

499
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,140
我生气时就是这样
When I get mad, that's what I do.

500
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,570
喂  我讲话方便
Hello? Yeah, I can talk.

501
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,580
我爸妈拉我来看一部烂片
My parents dragged me into this stupid movie.

502
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,700
上吧  杰  把他的手机塞他嘴里
Go ahead, Jay. Feed him his phone.

503
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,720
你是在说你不介意我那么做吗
You're telling me that doesn't bother you?

504
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,150
我听不清楚  大声点
I can't hear you. Talk louder.

505
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,900
我只是说
I'm just saying...

506
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,480
如果一有脾气就发作
...if we give in to every impulse,

507
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,140
那我们和禽兽就没有区别了
we're no better than wild animals.

508
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,640
但如果把怒气忍回去  会被活活气死的
But if we push it down, it eats you alive.

509
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,900
不介意不就行了吗
Not if you just let it go.

510
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,260
那部烂片《欢乐满人间》的女主角演的
The chick from that crapfest "Mary Poppins."

511
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,200
我受够了
That's it.

512
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,950
我妈开计程车时  我一个人在家里
A lot of cold, lonely nights in that apartment by myself

513
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,640
度过了很多寒冷孤独的夜
while my mom was driving a taxi,

514
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,490
只有一样东西陪伴我
and only one thing kept me company.

515
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,370
如果你对《欢乐满人间》有意见
So, you got a problem with poppins,

516
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,800
那就是对我有意见
you got a problem with me.

517
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,740
神父  真是对不起
Ay, Father, I am so sorry.

518
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,120
我根本不知道他可以拿起叉子
I didn't even know that he could hold a fork.

519
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,740
不  是我自己不好
No, no, no, I blame myself.

520
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,980
我不应该跟他玩"摘鼻子"游戏
I probably shouldn't have taken his nose.

521
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,830
不  是我家里的遗传问题
No, it's my family.

522
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,940
我家女孩都胸部丰满
The girls are very chesty,

523
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,640
但是男孩都有魔性
but the men, they're kissed by the devil.

524
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,070
歌洛莉亚  你这么担心
Gloria, the fact that you are so concerned

525
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,380
只是证明了你是一个有爱心的好妈妈
is only proof that you are a loving and caring mother.

526
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,320
对孩子们影响最大的是父母
It's the parents who shape the child.

527
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,110
你儿子的成长环境非常棒
And your son is growing up in a wonderful home.

528
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,030
去死吧  人渣
Die, scum!

529
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,030
不行不行
No, no, no!

530
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,800
大声点  像你刚才
Louder, like you did

531
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,780
在得来速快餐店那样
at the drive-through.

532
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,670
妈  杰和我看了《猛龙怪客》
Mom, Jay and I saw "Death Wish."

533
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,370
太好看了
Amazing.

534
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,260
曼尼在看《音乐之声》时和人打架
Manny got in a fight at "The Sound of Music,"

535
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,400
被赶出来了
got kicked out.

536
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,010
我从来没有这样骄傲过
I've never been so proud.

537
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,680
我想所有家庭
Well, I guess every household

538
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,290
都用得上一些指导和调整
could use a little fine-tuning, huh?

539
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,550
我给你我的名片
Let me give you my card

540
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,910
-上面有我手机号  -太好了
- with my cell number on it. - Please.

541
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,480
我的钱包去哪里了
And what did I do with my wallet? I...

542
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,090
我指责菲尔不帮忙
I had yelled at Phil for not helping out,

543
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,090
他却在那里  做我让他做的事情
and there he was, doing exactly what I had asked him to do...

544
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,180
西葫芦来啦
Here's our zucchini.

545
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,020
上来吧  小家伙
Up top, buddy.

546
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,900
却是在给别的家庭做
...for some other family.

547
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,250
你这样帮我们  你真是太好了
You are so sweet for helping me with this.

548
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,930
你受到了那么大的伤害  罗琳
How hurt you've been, Lorraine --

549
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,910
这个很好  这不算什么
This is sweet. This is...normal.

550
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,750
菲尔
Phil?

551
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,410
戴安
Diane?

552
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,640
你好  超级巨星
Hey, superstar.

553
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,980
你不是叫我超级巨星吗
I thought I was superstar.

554
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,030
你的丈夫对我真是太好了
Oh, your husband has been so wonderful to me.

555
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,720
他不是我的丈夫  他是我的房产中介
He's not my husband. He's my realtor.

556
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,960
他是我的房产中介
Oh, he's my realtor.

557
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
我是你们的房产中介
I'm both your realtors.

558
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,990
我真幸运能拥有如此...
I-I'm just lucky to have such a --

559
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,110
我们正准备去看房子
We're on our way to an open house.

560
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,500
所以你才不能带我去看
Oh, is that why you couldn't

561
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,570
那栋殖民风格的房子吗
show me the colonial later?

562
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,090
我做了你喜欢的玉米面包
I made that corn bread that you like.

563
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,030
我们会去看的
W-we're gonna make it to that.

564
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,480
我只需要结束和罗琳的事
I just have to finish up with Lorraine.

565
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,270
你是说  快点了结吗
Oh, you mean, like, "Get it over with"?

566
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,130
不  我不是那个意思
No, I-I don't mean that.

567
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,720
我以为你最爱吃西葫芦面包
And I thought zucchini bread was your favorite.

568
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,490
否则我为什么要买西葫芦
Why -- why am I buying zucchini?

569
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,330
一个人就不能既喜欢西葫芦面包
Hey, can't a guy like zucchini bread

570
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,370
又喜欢玉米面包吗
and corn bread?

571
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,290
-菲尔  -见鬼
- Phil? - Damn it.

572
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,190
罗妮
Ronnie!

573
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,120
你不是说去看医生吗
I thought you had a doctor's appointment.

574
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,950
所以你才没能去看达雷尔的游泳比赛
That's why you had to miss Darrell's swim meet.

575
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,960
她是谁
Who's she?

576
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,030
只是另一位客户
Just another client.

577
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,160
只是另一位客户
"Just another client"?

578
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,770
不是这意思  谁找我
No, that's -- what is this?

579
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,250
是我办公室打来的
Uh-oh, it is. It's my office.

580
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,320
得接一下
Got to take it.

581
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,070
-喂  -菲尔
- Hello? - Phil?

582
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,440
克莱尔
Claire?

583
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,700
全世界最好的房产中介
World's greatest realtor.

584
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,040
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

585
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,490
你头发出汗了
Your hair is sweating.

586
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,710
那是因为看到朋友们我太激动了
That's 'cause I'm excited to see my friends.

587
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,020
快走  小家伙
Let's go, buddy.

588
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,890
你们全是菲尔的客户吗
Are you all clients of Phil's?

589
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,970
显然是的
Apparently.

590
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,790
你们不可能碰到更好的人了
Well, you could not be in better hands.

591
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,180
我在人生最低潮时认识了菲尔
I met Phil when I was at such a rocky place in my life.

592
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,960
早上中午夜晚  他随叫随到
He was available to me morning, noon, and night.

593
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,800
当然他帮我找到了梦想之家
Of course he found me my dream house,

594
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,660
但最棒的还不在这一点
but that wasn't the best part.

595
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,880
菲尔教会我如何再次相信男人
Phil taught me how to trust a man again,

596
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,390
我想他的目的不在卖房子  而是帮人
and I think that was always his plan.

597
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,870
我目的不在卖房子  而是帮人
That was always my plan.

598
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,360
我碰到那样的前夫  让我再次相信男人
And it was not easy for me to trust a man

599
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
还真是不太容易
after the husband that I'd had.

600
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,280
那家伙把工具随便扔在院子里
This guys left tools in the yard,

601
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,730
让孩子们乱来
let the kids run wild.

602
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,870
很高兴见到你  克莱尔
Well, great to see you, Claire.

603
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,800
他总是打断我说话
He was always interrupting me.

604
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,620
他戴的睡眠眼罩真是笑死人了
And he wore the most ridiculous sleep-mask thing.

605
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,710
我的天  听起来好娘啊
Oh, god, sounds like such a diva.

606
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,170
也许他是对光很敏感
Or he's photosensitive,

607
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,830
这毛病很严重的
which is a real condition.

608
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,920
他从来不听我的意见
Never took my advice.

609
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,840
这是最糟糕的
You know, that's the worst part.

610
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,830
他从来没说过抱歉  一次也没有
He never -- he never said he was sorry just one time.

611
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,460
我只想听他说一句
I would kill to have heard,

612
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,700
"克莱尔  你是对的"
"Claire, you were right."

613
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,970
她是对的
She was right.

614
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,810
大声点
Louder.

615
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,160
我不喜欢你的这一面
I do not love this side of you.

616
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,120
多谢你帮我赢回了电脑
Thanks for winning my computer back.

617
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,680
还有我的钱  真是太厉害了
And getting me all my money. That was awesome.

618
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,100
如果我那时收手就好了
Yeah, if only I had stopped there,

619
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,580
但我就是不懂见好就收
but I had to go back down.

620
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,790
我太贪心了  又粗心大意
I got greedy, and I was careless.

621
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,450
我记得在学校学过一个寓言
There's a story about that I remember from school.

622
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,850
伊卡洛斯飞得离儿子太近
Icarus flew too close to his son.

623
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,850
[希腊神话  飞得离太阳太近  翅膀上的蜡熔掉了]

624
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,190
我想他们的翅膀撞上了
I think their wings bumped.

625
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,490
其中有一个掉了下去  他们可能是鸭子
One of them fell. They might have been ducks.

626
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,870
总之  教训就是  你得注意点儿
Anyway, the lesson is, is that you have to pay attention.

627
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,610
否则要付出终极代价
Or pay the ultimate price.

628
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,240
可以走了吗  亲爱的
Shall we, my dear?

629
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,400
不用等门
Don't wait up.

630
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,200
要等
Wait up.
