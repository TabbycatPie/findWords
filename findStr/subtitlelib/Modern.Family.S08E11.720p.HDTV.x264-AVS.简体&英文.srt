00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,450
我让人帮您把这放到礼物桌吧
Can I have that dropped at the gift table for you?

32
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,620
我自己拿着就好  这份礼物很特别
Ah, I think I'll hang onto this. This is a special gift.

33
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,940
是个恒温酒柜  有36个瓶位  不锈钢制
It's a wine fridge -- 36 bottles, stainless steel,

34
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,040
有双温区  可分别存放白酒和红酒
dual temp zones for your whites, your reds.

35
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,460
她不在乎  刚才那个神父也一样
She doesn't care. Okay. And neither did the priest.

36
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,660
名为"帅炸了"的神父
Father O'GodHe'sHot.

37
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,760
可不是吗  他的唇多性感啊
I know. Those lips, right?

38
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,550
-这样说神父合适吗  -合适吗
- Is that appropriate? - Appropriate?

39
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,020
你也从来没骄傲地抱着我们
You never carried us around as proudly

40
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,090
像你现在抱着那玩意儿一样
as you're carrying around that thing.

41
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,890
30年前  我没有免费帮你贝姬姑妈做衣柜
30 years ago, I didn't do your Aunt Becky's closets for free.

42
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,550
全家的人都说我是小气鬼
The whole family got together and decided I was cheap --

43
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,020
叫我"铁公鸡"
called me "High Pockets."

44
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,710
我们就来看看她儿子布莱恩
Well, we'll see what her boy Brian says

45
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,380
收到这个被时尚杂志评为
when he opens what Esquire Magazine called

46
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,940
"再也不需换新的恒温酒柜"时  会怎么说
"The last under-counter wine fridge you'll ever need."

47
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,900
铁公鸡
High Pockets.

48
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,100
我们直接到吧台去吧
Can we just find the bar?

49
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,060
我如果说不去  是不是会超好笑
How funny would it be if I said no?

50
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,860
我勒个...妈
Mother of...us.

51
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,430
妈  她怎么会在这儿
Mom! What is she doing here?

52
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,140
她跟这些人都没亲戚关系啊
She's not even related to these people!

53
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,140
天啊
Oh, my God.

54
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,670
只有你  我和爸妈
You, me, Mom, Dad, alone.

55
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,490
没有歌洛莉亚在这帮忙吸收仇恨的能量
Without Gloria to absorb the hate.

56
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,580
我怎么慌了  我好慌啊
Okay, why am I scared? I'm feeling scared.

57
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,950
因为你正回想起过去的每一次家族聚会
Because you are flashing back to every family event

58
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,670
最后都是爸爸用气音吼妈妈说
that ended with Dad whisper-screaming at Mom,

59
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,150
"你冷静点"  而她都会狂甩手拿包
"Would you calm down?" while she would swing her pocketbook

60
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,050
直到包包像墨西哥陶罐一样爆开  掉出一堆药丸
around until it burst open like a pill-packed pinata.

61
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,950
天啊  我不想再当闹笑话的那家人
Oh, God. I-I don't want to be the make-a-scene family. Again.

62
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,580
爸爸在他们为酒柜颁发个英雄奖给他之前
Well, Dad's not leaving until they award him CNN Hero

63
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,510
是不会走的
for bringing the wine fridge,

64
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,340
所以我们要不各领走一个家长
so maybe we just each take a parent

65
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,230
尽量不让他们碰到面
and try and keep them apart as much as possible?

66
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,630
这是我们最可能平安度过今日的方法了
Probably our best shot at an uneventful day.

67
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,310
但我们能不能别争让对方去陪着...
But can we please not fight over who has to care of --

68
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,240
妈
Mom!

69
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,480
米奇尔
Mitchell!

70
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,550
你好
Hi.

71
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,770
见到你真开心  宝贝儿
Oh, it's so good to see you, honey.

72
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,440
我找来一份校园地图  你看看
Hey. I got us a campus map, and look at this --

73
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,100
里面有一章特别介绍我以前大学兄弟会呢
My old college frat has a chapter here!

74
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,600
根据继承权力  我有权
By legacy rights, I'm entitled

75
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,110
使用主层的洗手间和登记借走飞盘
to use the main-floor bathroom and sign out a frisbee.

76
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,930
酷
Cool.

77
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,160
你用这带子健身得挺猛啊
Wow, you're really giving those bands a workout.

78
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,750
想释放一些紧张情绪
Oh, just burning off some nervous energy.

79
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,110
他们不会在参观大学途中问问题吧
They don't ask questions on a college tour, right?

80
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,460
卢克  我  歌洛莉亚和曼尼要去参观大学
Luke and I, Gloria, and Manny are going on a college tour!

81
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,020
是曼尼的保底大学  对卢克来说则是机会渺茫
Safety school for Manny, long shot for Luke,

82
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,950
这很伤他自尊心
which hasn't been great for his self-esteem.

83
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,380
幸好  作为曾经的拉拉队队员
Luckily, as a former cheerleader,

84
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,700
我还记得怎样鼓舞士气
I haven't lost my gift for lifting spirits.

85
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,870
虽然我的身体已经不再柔软  摆不出N字了
Though I can no longer make an N with my body.

86
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,440
这样健身挺有效的
This is a great workout.

87
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,580
不
Ow! No!

88
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,410
抱歉  抱歉  你们快来看
Sorry, sorry! Guys, come look!

89
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,890
我做了顽皮的坏事
I did something very bad.

90
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,660
曼尼在睡午觉
Manny is taking a nap,

91
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,080
我就把小猪放到床上去了
so I put a pig-a-let in the bed!

92
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,140
天啊
Oh, my God.

93
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,150
你从哪里弄来的
Where'd you get that?

94
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,620
你还记得我们遇到的那些农民吗
You remember those farmers that we met?

95
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,610
你想象不出他们为了一点小钱愿意做出什么事
You'll be surprised what they'll do for a couple of big tips.

96
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,330
你听到什么了
What did you hear?

97
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,870
要死了  什么鬼啊
Aah! Whoa! What is that?!

98
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,590
是只小猪
It's a pig-a-let!

99
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,040
你真该看看自己的表情
Man, you should see your face!

100
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,360
它还舔了我的脸  你干啥啊
Ohh, it licked my face! Why would you do this?

101
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
曼尼  别那么神经紧绷
Aye, Manny, don't be so uptight!

102
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,640
我在帮你备战大学生活
I'm preparing you for college

103
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,290
到时你就可以融入大家  交上朋友了
so that you fit in and make some friends.

104
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,090
{\an8}两部电影皆描述了有关大学兄弟会的故事

105
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,720
我从电影《动物屋》里学来的招数
I took the idea from watching "The Animal House,"

106
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,090
还有《单身男子俱乐部》
"The Old School" Movie...

107
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,910
上大学是为了接受高等教育  不是恶作剧整人
College is about higher education, not pranks.

108
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,250
书呆
Nerd!

109
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,630
-她在那儿呢  -美女
- There she is! - Hey, lady.

110
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,860
我不能给你们免单
Yeah, I can't give you free stuff.

111
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,230
-我们走吧  -好  保重
- Let's go. - Okay, take care.

112
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,260
等等  等等  等等
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

113
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,890
天啊  是她
Oh, my gosh. It's her.

114
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,680
谁啊
Who?

115
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,790
坐在那边  外套美鞋子赞的金发女
The blonde over there in the cute jacket and fab shoes.

116
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,900
如果真是我想的那个人  我们超讨厌她
If that's who I think it is, we hate her so hard.

117
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,220
昨晚我被打劫了  没错
Last night, I was robbed. That's right.

118
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,320
我去看莉莉的舞蹈演出
There I was at Lily's dance recital,

119
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,700
屏住呼吸期待
breathlessly anticipating

120
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,360
我宝贝女儿的首次芭蕾独舞
my baby's first-ever ballet solo.

121
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,610
马上到了
Okay, here it comes.

122
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,310
为了这一刻  花掉的两千块舞蹈课钱都值了
This moment is worth every cent of the $2,000 in lessons.

123
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,150
啥
What?

124
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,910
天啊  我看不到了
Oh, my gosh. I can't see.

125
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,270
不是说了不许拍摄吗
Didn't they say no filming?

126
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,290
不好意思  女士
Excuse me. Miss?

127
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,200
你看到她多过分吗
Did you just see that?

128
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,950
那个可怕的女人劫走了我
That horrid woman robbed me

129
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,550
当骄傲爸爸的珍贵时刻
of my proud daddy moment

130
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,470
害我得向女儿说谎
and forced me to lie to my daughter.

131
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,260
"你跳得太棒了  莉莉"  可是是真的吗
"You danced beautifully, Lily!" But did she?

132
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,730
我咋知道啊
I have no idea!

133
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,450
你昨晚怎么不把她击倒啊
Why didn't you smack her down last night?

134
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,760
我是指用语言击倒
With words, obviously.

135
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,020
等等  男同可以扁女人吗
Wait, can gays smack women?

136
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,860
不行
No.

137
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,670
不行  你知道吗
No! You know what,

138
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,780
我昨晚本来要大骂她的
I would have cussed her out last night,

139
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,230
可那自私的老巫婆在她女儿一跳完
except the selfish hag left the moment

140
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,840
就溜走了
her daughter's dance was over.

141
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,260
希望这餐厅不禁止暴乱
I hope there's no rule in here about causing a commotion.

142
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,180
我们是觉得不需要
I mean, we didn't really feel the need

143
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,730
特地竖个牌子写明不可以  毕竟是文明社会了
to put it up on a sign because, you know, civilization.

144
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,790
我遵从的是老天爷的法律
Well, I answer to a higher law.

145
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,100
给我回来
Hey! Get back here!

146
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,860
你都不确定是不是她
You don't even know it's her.

147
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,220
你凭黑暗里看到的一个后脑勺
You're basing this off of the back of the head

148
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,420
就认定这是她
of someone you saw in the dark.

149
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,650
或许你能从"背后"认出前男友  但...
That may be how you recognize your old boyfriends, but...

150
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,850
不好意思
Excuse me.

151
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,220
虽然我很欣赏你的招数  并打算不给你功劳
As much as I admire that and do intend on using it

152
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,100
就让米奇尔来试这招  但做人要有底线
on Mitchell without giving you any credit, there is a line.

153
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,450
妈  我都不知道你要来
So, Mom, I didn't know that you would be, uh, be here.

154
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,050
我本来也没打算来
Oh, well, I wasn't planning on it --

155
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,400
离婚后都没见过这些人了
I haven't seen these people since the divorce --

156
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,990
但我新老公要去工作
Yeah. But then my new hubby had to work,

157
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,240
我于是心想  "写个新故事吧  迪迪"
and I thought -- "Write a new story, Dede."

158
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,950
就是啊
Yeah!

159
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,170
你一个人来的吗  还是...
So, are you here alone, or...?

160
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,810
你好美啊  这条裙子真漂亮
You look great! This dress is beautiful!

161
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,500
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

162
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,910
我从买来的车子的后尾箱里捡的
I found it in the trunk of a car I bought.

163
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,720
稍等  妈妈
Oh. One second, Mom.

164
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,060
是小卡
Oh, this is Cam texting.

165
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,170
是一个人的后脑勺的照片
The picture of the back of someone's head

166
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,970
还写着  "是她吗"
and the words, "Is this her?"

167
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,470
不知道你在说什么
No idea what you are talking about.

168
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,680
亲亲表情
Kissy face.

169
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,810
不好意思  能帮我们照张相吗
Excuse me. Can we get a pic?

170
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,730
宝贝儿来
Honey!

171
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,460
爸  你真有心
Dad, that's sweet.

172
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,540
不是吧
Really?

173
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,310
如果我和礼物分开了  还有证据
If we get separated, there's a record.

174
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,380
天啊
Oh, God.

175
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,290
别生气
Hey, don't be mad.

176
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,140
你不是吧
Are you kidding?

177
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,380
她消失了  好吗
She vanished, okay?

178
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,700
她做的那些鞋子走路没声音的
Those shoes she makes are soundless.

179
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,450
你们在这儿啊
Oh, there you are!

180
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,460
好啊
Okay.

181
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,250
这不是我的第一任家庭吗
if it isn't my first family.

182
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,600
真没想到你也会来
What a surprise, huh?

183
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,880
是啊  我想布莱恩邀请我
Yeah! I guess Brian invited me

184
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,990
是因为那个夏天我们收留过他
because of that summer we took him in.

185
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,340
还记得你偷偷试穿布莱恩的内裤被我抓到吗
Remember when I caught you trying on Brian's underpants?

186
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,290
不记得  你在说什么  妈
No, what even -- Mom!

187
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,950
这桌只有四个人吗
Oh, is it just the four of us?

188
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,840
是的
Yeah!

189
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,190
是的  你的座位在哪  妈
Yes, and where are you sitting, Mom?

190
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,540
让我送你回你那桌吧
I can walk you back to your table.

191
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,510
再等一会儿
In a minute.

192
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,800
我想叙叙旧
I'd like to visit a little.

193
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
我那桌的人我一个都不认识
I don't even know anyone at my table.

194
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,020
既然歌洛莉亚今天没来
Well, Gloria's not here...

195
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,560
谢谢你  杰
Oh, thank you, Jay.

196
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,080
让我帮你腾个位置
Here. Let me, uh...

197
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,380
这样真好
Well, this is fun.

198
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,700
-老队伍又会合了  -是啊
- The band's back together. - Yeah.

199
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,970
有人想来杯香槟吗
Would anyone care for some champagne?

200
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,110
-想  -我想来一杯
- Oh, yeah. - I'd love some.

201
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,330
-你猜对了  -谢谢
- Oh, you bet. Yeah. - Thank you.

202
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,790
一整盘都留下吧
I'll just take the tray.

203
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,470
入学越来越困难了
Admission has gotten tougher.

204
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,470
10位申请者中大约只有4位能入学
Only about 4 out of 10 applicants get accepted.

205
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
比那更低的几率你都克服过
You've beaten worse odds than that.

206
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,530
我们直到你6岁才想起给你接种疫苗
We forgot to get you vaccinated till you were 6.

207
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,110
本大学有许多引以为傲的毕业生
The University boasts many noted graduates --

208
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,010
科研人员  新闻工作者
research scientists, journalists,

209
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,100
还有一位挺出名的剧作家
and one pretty well-known playwright.

210
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,930
什么叫"挺出名"
Wow. "Pretty well-known?"

211
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,890
"著名的阿摩司"牌饼干
Imagine how many cookies

212
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,060
如果当初叫"挺出名的阿摩司"饼干
they could have sold if they called them

213
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,880
卖得出去才怪
"Pretty Well-Known Amos's."

214
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,450
我把你两只脚的鞋带绑在一起了
I tied your shoelaces together.

215
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,930
妈  你这几天是怎么了
Mom, what's going on with you?

216
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,350
我在帮你做心理准备
I am preparing you.

217
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,820
如果你不能自嘲
If you can't laugh at yourself,

218
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,380
就会成为被人嘲笑的目标
then you'll become a target.

219
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,510
大学可疯狂了  哥们
College crazy time, man!

220
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,950
打扰一下  史黛菲
Excuse me, Steffi?

221
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,170
我儿子蒂姆开发了一个金融应用程序
My son Tim here developed a finance app

222
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,220
摩根大通公司的人很感兴趣
that caught the eye of some folks at JP Morgan,

223
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,610
所以他得一边上学一边继续开发
so he'll need to keep that going along with school.

224
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,580
没问题
No problem.

225
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,900
许多学生在校时都有工作
Many students work while taking class.

226
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,480
-打扰一下  史黛菲  -你干什么
- Excuse me, Steffi? - What are you doing?

227
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,930
我儿子卢卡斯是经认证的业余蹦床运动员
My son Lucas here is a recognized amateur trampolinist.

228
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,670
爸
Dad!

229
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,660
我想你们应该有相应的训练设施
I'm assuming you guys have a training facility

230
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,100
让他能继续追求这门应用跳跃的艺术吧
so he can continue his pursuits in the applied bouncing arts?

231
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,770
我好像没听懂
I'm not sure I'm understanding...

232
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,810
你们有没有蹦床
Do you guys have a trampoline?

233
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,900
托儿所好像有张小的
I think there's a small one in the daycare center.

234
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,750
世上没有不够大的蹦床  只有...
There are no small trampolines, only --

235
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,790
我们还是继续吧
You know what? We can move on.

236
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,230
大家这边走
Everybody, this way!

237
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,980
你就直接问她昨晚有没有去看舞蹈演出
Just go ask her if she was at the recital,

238
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,190
如果她说有  就把她骂跑
and then tell her off if she says yes.

239
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,580
不行  我不能问  因为如果是她
No, I can't, because if it's her,

240
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,890
她会感觉到敌意然后否认
she'll sense confrontation coming and deny it.

241
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
我转到攻击模式时总能被人看出来
People can always tell when I'm in attack mode.

242
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
-因为你气得鼻孔扩大吗  -不是
- Mm, flared nostrils? - No.

243
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,560
因为你气得额头爆血管  脖子起红疹吗
Vein in your forehead? Blotchy neck?

244
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,910
不是  你们知道吗
No! You know what,

245
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,290
别怪我没提醒  你俩越来越像你们老妈了
and just a head's up, you both are turning into your mother.

246
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,980
好吧
Okay.

247
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,280
新计划
New plan.

248
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,570
你要干什么
What-What are you doing?

249
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,360
如果她平板电脑上有莉莉演出的视频
Well, if there's video of Lily's recital on her iPad,

250
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,490
我就能肯定是她
then I know it's for sure her,

251
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,130
再说我还能把视频发给自己
and plus, I can e-mail it to myself

252
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,400
再办个正式的观影派对
and have a proper viewing party.

253
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,290
我那天有事
Ooh, I've got a thing.

254
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,240
我八成要工作
Yeah, I'll probably be working.

255
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,470
我日子都还没定呢
I haven't even set a date yet.

256
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,660
好吧  要密码
Okay, there's a passcode.

257
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,740
当然要密码
Well, of course there's a passcode.

258
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,630
给我
Give me that.

259
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,520
好的  她点了撒糖粉的甜甜圈  所以
All right, well, she ordered a powdered doughnut, so...

260
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,430
果然
All right.

261
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,380
数字8  5  3和1上面都有带粉的指纹
Chalky fingerprints on the 8, the 5, the 3, and the 1.

262
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,330
密码是那4个数字的某种组合
Your passcode is some combination of those four.

263
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,470
我的天  你太天才了
Oh, my God. You're brilliant.

264
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,730
去年我还在加州理工学院做微分地形学
Last year, I was doing differential topography at Cal Tech,

265
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,720
如今却为老大不小还玩滑板的人
and now I sketch leaves in milk foam

266
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,470
在奶泡上画叶子
for adult skateboarders.

267
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,660
我需要找点别的追求
I need something more.

268
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,830
-她回来了  -什么
- She's coming back. - What?!

269
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,850
她回来了
She's coming back.

270
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,580
我把平板电脑留在桌上  被人偷走了
I left my iPad on the table, and somebody took it.

271
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,560
天哪  我没...
Oh, gosh! I didn't --

272
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,680
没什么  做好你的工作吗
Didn't what? Do your job?

273
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,580
你也没忙到不能...
It's not like you're so busy you don't have time to --

274
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,750
打扰一下  我不小心听到你们说话
Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing.

275
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,430
你说的平板电脑是包里那个吗
Um, are you talking about that iPad in that bag there?

276
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,190
-天啊  -因为包里就有个平板电脑
- Oh, God. - 'Cause there's an iPad there.

277
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,360
我真是白痴
What a ditz.

278
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,780
我这次荒唐的相亲让我太紧张了
Ugh, I guess I'm just nervous for this stupid blind date

279
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,250
我真不该答应下来
I never should have agreed to.

280
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,040
糟糕
Oh, no.

281
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,360
你该不会就是理查德吧
You're not Richard, are you?

282
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,300
是的  我就是理查德
Uh, yes. I-I am Richard.

283
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,410
我是你的相亲对象
I'm your blind date.

284
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,610
你就是安娜吧
You're, uh, Ana.

285
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,990
我这人真是糟糕透顶  对吧
Oh! Am I the worst person ever?

286
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,680
相亲的目的不就是摸清你是个怎样的人吗
Well, that's what we're here to find out.

287
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,750
开玩笑的  快请坐
Kidding! Please sit!

288
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,910
我希望是她  她这人真恶心
I hope that is her. She's gross.

289
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,960
我想看他骂她
I want him to yell at her.

290
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,600
-是啊  -打扰一下
- Yeah. - Excuse me.

291
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,380
我是来相亲的
Um, I'm here for a blind date,

292
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,150
但我朋友没把对象的照片发给我
and my friend didn't even give me a picture.

293
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,650
我只知道那位女士的名字
I just know the woman's name.

294
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,660
你的顾客中有名叫安娜的吗
Any chance you served an Ana?

295
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,930
真是无巧不成书
Oh! Well, this is crazy.

296
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,890
安娜  快来见见
Ana, say hello to, uh...

297
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,990
-理查德  -正是
- Richard. - Yeah.

298
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,840
不好意思  我无意唐突
Um, sorry, I don't mean to be forward,

299
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,450
但你比瓦妮莎形容得美多了
but Vanessa kind of undersold how attractive you are.

300
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,550
太惊艳了
Wowza.

301
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,560
我因为被说漂亮而做过的无下限事太多了  
The things I've done because people tell me I'm pretty,

302
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,090
差点会让人以为我其实不漂亮
you'd almost think I wasn't pretty.

303
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,440
1986年
So, 1986,

304
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,390
我们刚参加完我姐碧碧的婚礼回来
we were just coming back from my sister Bebe's wedding

305
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,570
那是我第一次梦到谋杀你
when I first had my dream about murdering you.

306
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,700
别说了  米奇尔有个有趣的故事
No! Mitchell has a funny story

307
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,080
不会揭开旧疮疤
that doesn't open old wounds

308
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,350
讲的是小卡在舞蹈演出的事
about Cam at a dance recital.

309
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,440
他当时气坏了  对吧  米奇尔
He got so mad, didn't he, Mitchell?

310
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,240
快告诉他们
Tell them!

311
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,430
是气坏了
So mad.

312
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,410
那不是86年  是87年
That wasn't '86. That was '87.

313
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,740
我们迟到是因为你逼我参加
The reason we were late was because of that damn

314
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,830
那个全美手拉手的破活动
Hands Across America that you made me do.

315
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,930
手拉手是在86年
Hands was '86,

316
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,400
你事后还感谢我了
and you thanked me afterwards

317
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,550
因为和你拉手的人
because you got to hold hands with someone

318
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,660
另一只手拉的是著名歌手威利·纳尔逊
that was holding hands with Willie Nelson.

319
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,600
那个活动是为什么筹善款来着  解决饥饿吗
What the hell was that whole thing about, anyway? Hunger?

320
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,530
在旧金山递给某人一个三明治
Hand somebody a sandwich in San Francisco

321
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,850
沿着人手传下去
and pass it down the line

322
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,160
一直传到波士顿某个流浪汉手里吗
till some bum gets ahold of it in Boston?

323
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,860
饥饿  是的  绝对是
Hunger, yeah. Definitely.

324
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,890
说起饥饿  米奇尔在节食呢
Um, Mitchell is on a diet, speaking of hunger.

325
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,190
你现在能吃什么
What can you eat now?

326
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,280
吃少点
Uh... less.

327
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,170
宝贝  我明白你的用意
Sweetie, I see what you're doing,

328
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,370
但你控制欲这么强  很难相处
but this whole controlling thing -- it's challenging.

329
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,360
在办公室很有帮助
Works good in the office,

330
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,550
但有时她比沙暴中的骆驼的屁股还紧绷
but sometimes she's as tight as a camel's ass in a sandstorm.

331
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,960
您这话略伤人吧
Ooh, this seems aggressive.

332
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,060
我想去
I'm just gonna --

333
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,530
能原谅我去用一下洗手间吗
May I be excused to go to the bathroom?

334
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,230
我也去  马上回来
Yeah. Me too. Be right back.

335
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,840
你别想跟我来这招
Hey! You do not get to do this.

336
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,200
不许你用你小时候
You do not get to shut down on me

337
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,480
对他们搞自闭的招数来对我
like you did when we were kids.

338
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,420
我才不要在这里帮你顶着压力
I am not gonna sit here taking the heat

339
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,190
而你却躲回房间大听女摇滚歌后的歌
while you go hide in your room blasting Pat Benatar.

340
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,660
我们到底为啥要坐在一起啊
Why are we even all sitting together?

341
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,450
我有个计划
This is my plan.

342
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,390
你得想出个理由
You're gonna come up with a reason

343
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,450
把妈带回她那桌
to take Mom back to her table.

344
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,120
可能你有一些基佬事儿想倾诉
Maybe you want to unload some gay stuff

345
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,420
而你又不想老爸听见
you don't want Dad to hear?

346
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,570
你人"真好"
You're lovely.

347
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,440
但我的梦境分析师帮我认识到
But my dream analyst helped me realize

348
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,580
其实我从未真的想要谋杀你
that I never wanted to murder you.

349
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,110
我想谋杀的是自己心中的愤怒
I wanted to murder the part of myself that was so angry.

350
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,490
你会愤怒是因为我情商低又爱吹牛逼
You were angry because I was an inconsiderate blow-hard.

351
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,000
别怪自己了
Oh, don't do that.

352
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,900
我们也有过许多欢乐时光啊  对吧  大人
We had plenty of good times, didn't we, Sarge?

353
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,170
当然啦  小豆宝
You bet we did, Pea.

354
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,560
这又是什么鬼
What fresh hell is this?

355
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,130
参观之旅就在地标钟楼下结束啦
We'll end our tour here at our iconic bell tower.

356
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,810
晚上的派对见啦
See you all at tonight's mixer!

357
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,480
我们回去前  想做点好玩的吗
Hey. Before we go back, you want to do something fun?

358
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,300
跟我来
Follow me.

359
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,130
-快看  -看个钟吗
- Check it out! -A bell?

360
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,370
不是单纯的钟
Not just a bell.

361
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,460
是一系列不同的钟组合成一种独特的乐器
A series of bells fed into an ingenious instrument

362
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,060
名为钟琴
known as a carillon.

363
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,350
想当年我也玩过这乐器
I monkied around with one back in the day.

364
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,690
一个叫葛雷琴的小妞带我上她钟楼
A cutie named Gretchen took me up to her belfry

365
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,660
亮了几招来让我"大开眼界"
and showed me some moves,

366
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,420
我现在意识到这话听起来有点黄
which I now realize sounds sexual.

367
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,590
还好啦  你说话常这样
Not really. You talk like this a lot.

368
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,150
重点是  葛雷琴靠着玩钟绝活
The point is, Gretchen got a full ride

369
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,660
得到了奖学金呢  好高啊
treading bells like these. Wow, that's high.

370
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,980
或许你也可以啊
Maybe you could, too.

371
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,340
让你去上个班...
Get you into a class on...

372
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,750
然后呢  在三个月之内学会吗
What? I'm gonna learn all this in three months?

373
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,850
你学习速度很快啊
You're a quick study!

374
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,160
你看你多快就学会魔术了
Look at how fast you learned magic.

375
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,600
我还有你小时候从你的尿布里拉出一条
I got a home movie of you pulling an impossibly long chain

376
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,040
超级无敌长的湿纸巾的影片呢
of baby wipes out of your diaper.

377
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,060
我五岁了还着穿尿布
Okay, I was 5 in a diaper.

378
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,970
那不能算作我学习速度快的证明吧
That's not really a sign of a quick learner.

379
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,150
我相信只要你愿意下功夫  你什么都能做到
I believe you can do anything you put your mind to.

380
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,940
为啥啊
Why?

381
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,420
我去
Oh! Shoot!

382
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,590
看来现在都是全自动化的了
I guess it's all computerized now.

383
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,610
那又怎样
Who cares?

384
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,800
靠  我真的超讨厌你这样
God, I hate it when you do this.

385
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,010
哪样啊  你看起来挺生气  你在生气吗
Do what? You look mad. Are you mad?

386
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,400
我跟你说过很多次了
...and I keep telling you,

387
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,810
可是感觉你从来没听进去
but it's like you're not hearing me!

388
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,310
真听不到  等等  先别说
I'm not. Wait, don't talk yet.

389
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,540
现在  快说
Go now, quick!

390
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,840
别再装作我不止如此
Stop acting like I'm someone I'm not!

391
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,600
别再我明明没那么好  却猛称赞我
Stop telling me how great I am when it's not true!

392
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,070
你看不出这样会给我造成很大压力吗
Don't you see how much pressure that is?!

393
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,760
卢克  不许你转身离我...
Luke, don't you walk away from --

394
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,150
而去
...me!

395
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,170
我可是你...
I'm your --

396
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,610
你怎么可能36岁啊
How are you 36?

397
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,570
脑子里一直在想你看起来超年轻
I just can't get over how young you look.

398
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,690
诀窍就是别笑太大
The trick is to not smile too hard.

399
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,700
你真有意思
You're funny.

400
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,480
我真没想到地震学家也能这么有趣
I did not expect that from a seismologist.

401
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,470
说到这里  你是怎么进入这行的啊
Which, by the way, how did you get into that?

402
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,270
天赋异禀  老天爷赏饭吃吧  
Oh, um, it's just always come easy for me.

403
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,460
就是我只要扫一眼别人
You know? I look at people

404
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,890
很直觉就能知道她们的尺码
and I just instinctively know their size.

405
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,880
比如人家说"我衣服穿4号"
People are like, "Oh, I'm a 4,"

406
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,010
我就会说"少来了  胖妹
and I'm like, "Who you foolin', girl?

407
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,850
你穿10号"
You a 10."

408
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,970
女士  这是您要的纸巾
Ma'am, here is that napkin you asked for.

409
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,680
谢谢  
Oh, thanks. 

410
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,280
哈哈  骗到你了吧
Ha ha. Fooled you.

411
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,380
刚才衣服的事情就是开玩笑
I was just joking about clothing stuff.

412
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,130
我真正开始学习地震的原因呢
The real reason why I got into studying earthquakes

413
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,570
是因为我热爱大自然
is because I love nature.

414
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,180
所以也难怪你对禽学也有兴趣了吧
I guess that would explain the ornithology interest, too, huh?

415
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,580
小姐  能再给我递张...
Miss, could I have another...

416
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,360
好啦  好啦  好啦
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

417
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,840
天使一直都是超酷的东西嘛
Angels have always been cool,

418
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,290
但是再酷也没鸟类酷
but not as cool as birds!

419
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,940
我超爱鸟类
I love birds!

420
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,620
我爱我妈妈啊  真的
I mean, I love my mother, I do,

421
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,200
可是她这人自我中心  不考虑他人感受
but it's like her needs come before everyone else's.

422
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,650
你认识这样的人吗
You know that kind of person?

423
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,280
我好像真有认识呢
I think I do, yeah.

424
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,840
等等  为啥我开始聊起我妈了
Wait, why was I talking about her?

425
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,070
不知道啊  我本来是问
I don't know. The question was --

426
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,280
"你昨晚做什么了"
"What did you do last night?"

427
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,840
这问题我还在等你回答
And the question stands.

428
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,260
抱歉
Sorry.

429
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,510
我前夫
Ex-husband.

430
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,850
他就不能跟我儿子共处超过三小时
Honestly, it's like he can't be with my son

431
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,530
并且不问我一些没意义的愚蠢问题吗
for more than three hours without texting me some inane question.

432
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,020
原来你有个儿子啊
Oh -- Oh, you have a son?

433
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,500
我的一生挚爱
Love of my life.

434
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,020
离婚这事对他打击挺大
He took the divorce pretty hard.

435
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,920
他比较特别  你懂吗
He's...different, you know?

436
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,790
他比较...
He's really --

437
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,510
他很有创意  内心敏感
He's creative and sensitive,

438
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,830
在学校常常受欺负
and he gets picked on a lot at school.

439
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,340
真是幸好有他的舞蹈班
You know, it's like, thank God for his dance class.

440
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,830
感觉那里好像是唯一
I feel like it's the only place

441
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,000
我能看到他感到真正开心的地方
that I see, like, real joy on his face.

442
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,310
我就知道
I knew it.

443
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,540
你就是个大烂人
You're the worst!

444
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,650
你说什么
Excuse me?

445
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,120
我不是理查德  你个白痴
I'm not Richard, you fool.

446
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,220
我是被你跟你的大平板
I'm the father you and your giant iPad

447
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,700
夺走自己女儿初次芭蕾独舞的父亲
robbed of his daughter's first ballet solo.

448
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,520
我本来期望你有个
I hope whatever reason you had

449
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,000
很好的理由才把自己孩子放在我孩子之上
to prioritize your child over mine was a good one,

450
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,730
而现在我听到理由  虽然挺有理
and now that I hear it, it's pretty close,

451
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,160
这我承认  但你还是烂
I have to admit, but still.

452
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,160
你真是个神经病
You're a maniac,

453
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,560
但我挺庆幸的
but I'm grateful

454
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,530
因为这是我一生中所去过
because this has been one of the most abysmal dates

455
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,760
最烂的约会之一了
I have ever been on.

456
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,770
大多数人觉得猫咪都很冷淡
People think that cats are standoffish,

457
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,900
但我家的这只  每当我回家时...
but my guy, when I come home --

458
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
好了  我得请你暂停一下了
Okay, I've got to stop you right there.

459
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,940
我其实不是安娜  我们之间也不来电
I'm not Ana, and this isn't happening.

460
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,640
我感觉到了
I had a feeling.

461
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,000
我能起码跟你合个影吗
Can I at least take a picture with you

462
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,620
这样我能跟其他女人说我跟你约会过
so I can tell other women we dated?

463
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,890
什么  不行
What? No!

464
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,900
你说得对
You're right.

465
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,020
只是因为你真的超漂亮
It's just that you're so pretty.

466
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,440
好啦  过来拍一张吧
All right, get in here.

467
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,320
小姐
Ma'am?

468
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,820
曼尼  别这样
Manny, come on.

469
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,650
我们去派对要迟到了
We're going to be late for the mixer.

470
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,660
不好意思  我让你从冷板凳起来了吗
Excuse me, did I say your time-out was over?

471
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,710
回你床上去
Back on the bed.

472
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,940
对不起嘛  再也不整你了
I'm sorry, okay? No more pranks.

473
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,310
我发誓
I promise.

474
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,930
我就是想跟你玩一下嘛  真是的
I just wanted to have fun with you. Geez!

475
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,840
我忘了我在里面动了手脚
I forgot I did that one!

476
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,300
曼尼  对不起嘛
Aye, Manny! Por favor!

477
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,050
出去  你给我出去
Get out. Get out!

478
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,710
卢克  我们来谈谈
Luke, we should talk about this!

479
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,740
没什么好谈的
There's nothing to talk about.

480
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,270
你也别想来这个白痴的派对
And you're not coming to this stupid party.

481
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,290
-我要自己去  -我也是
- I'm going alone. - So am I.

482
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,200
我才不想去上什么傻逼钟琴课
Like I want to take some stupid bell class

483
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,170
只为了发掘另一个我不擅长的领域
so we can all find out there's one more thing I can't do.

484
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,100
别说了  至少你爸对你有信心
Oh, boo-hoo. Your dad believes in you.

485
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,920
我妈把我当日本整蛊节目的来宾一样
My mom's treating me like I'm on some Japanese game show.

486
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,730
好  你赢
Fine! You win!

487
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,190
比爸妈差劲你赢  比考大学你赢
You win worst parent, you win college.

488
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,260
祝你万事都赢  我就去地下铲屎处
Hope you have fun here while I'm shoveling poo

489
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,050
铲屎就好啦
in some underground poo-shoveling place.

490
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,000
如果你确信自己考不上
Well, why'd you even come here

491
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,400
为什么还要来呢
if you're so sure you can't get in?

492
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,250
我也不知道
I don't know.

493
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,550
大概这是唯一一个我们都能考上的地方
Maybe because this is the one place we might both get in.

494
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,540
和你一起  大学才不会那么可怕
That might make this whole thing a little less scary!

495
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,320
我也是因为这样才报名这里啊
Well, that's the only reason I applied, too!

496
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,800
-那我们还吵什么  -我哪知道
-Then why are we fighting?! -I don't know!

497
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,950
那我们还去派对吗
So, are we still going to the party?

498
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,270
去啊  等我戴个帽子
Yeah, I'll put on a hat!

499
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,010
我只想让卢克对自己有点自信
I just wanted Luke to feel good about himself, you know?

500
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,480
想给他加加油而已
Cheer him on a little.

501
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,440
大概过分鼓励也不好
Maybe there is such a thing as too much cheerleading.

502
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,980
如果你总是说有多相信他
You tell him he can do anything, and when he can't,

503
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,780
那他一旦失败  就会觉得令你失望了
he feels like he's disappointing you.

504
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,150
卢克知道我永远不会对他失望
Luke knows I'd never be disappointed in him.

505
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,990
是吗  卢克是很贴心
Does he? Luke is very sweet,

506
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,130
但也不是总那么灵光啊
but he doesn't know a lot of things.

507
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,190
所以我应该适当鼓励他
So I'm supposed to pump him up,

508
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,550
但不要过度鼓励以致他会担心令我失望
but not so much that he's afraid to let me down.

509
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,500
我做不好这件事也挺讽刺的
It's ironic that I'm struggling with this

510
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,120
因为我最厉害的拉拉队招式就是"穿针引线"
since my greatest cheerleading move was threading the needle.

511
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,950
就是7名拉拉队队员这么圈起手臂
It's when your seven cheermates make hoop arms --

512
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,970
不想听
I don't care.

513
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,010
我只想让曼尼能开得起玩笑
I just want Manny to learn how to take a joke.

514
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,980
但大喊"变态"然后把他
Yes, but there's a difference between a joke

515
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,700
他推进女更衣室还是跟
and yelling "Pervert!" before shoving him

516
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,990
普通开玩笑有差别的
into the girls' locker room.

517
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,190
多好玩啊
Aye, please, that was funny.

518
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,890
而且我这么挡着不让他出来时
Besides, I was the one who broke a heel

519
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,710
还把鞋跟弄坏了呢
trying to keep the door shut.

520
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,690
大学是人生中的重大改变
College is a big change.

521
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,710
我只想让他轻松应对
I'm just trying to keep it light for him.

522
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,590
是为了他还是为了你自己
For him or for you?

523
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,140
好啦
Okay.

524
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,590
这是他人生中第一次离开我
He's leaving me for the first time in his life.

525
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,450
我在婚姻中浮浮沉沉
I've been married, I've been divorced,

526
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,530
也曾不停搬家
I've lived here, I've lived there.

527
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,680
我开过出租车  也赢过"星探"节目
I drove a taxi, I won "Star Search."

528
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,250
可不管多少场变故  曼尼一直在我身边
Through all the changes in my life, there was always us.

529
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,120
像我的搭档
Like partners.

530
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,570
如果不保持搞笑的气氛  我会很难过的
If I don't keep this light, I am going to be very sad.

531
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,050
我知道  这不好受
I know. It stinks.

532
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,870
只能祈祷年底时  孩子会把你烦得不行
You just have to hope they get irritating enough

533
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,440
你就能开心地送他走了
by the end of the year that you're ready for them to go.

534
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,380
那我应该把口琴还给他
Maybe I should give him his harmonica back.

535
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,740
这么想就对了
That's the spirit.

536
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,410
你吃我这半块牛肉
Here, take my half steak.

537
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,820
我吃你半条鱼
I'll take half your fish.

538
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,760
我偶尔得骗骗我的动脉
I got to trick my arteries every once in a while,

539
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,010
不然他们又要造反了
keep them on their toes.

540
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,870
虽然我不知道你最近在忙什么
Well, I don't know what you're doing,

541
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,860
但你看上去很好
but you look great.

542
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,280
你气色也不错
And you look great, too.

543
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,050
吧台那里有个空位
Oh, look, there's no line at the bar.

544
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,870
看在往日情分去喝杯鸡尾酒如何
How about a Rob Roy for old time's sake?

545
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,850
中士  你还记得呢
Oh, you remembered, Sarge.

546
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,260
我怀孕的时候只喝这种酒
That was the only drink I could keep down when I was pregnant.

547
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,550
他们俩怎么了
Who are those people?

548
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,230
你听到了  他们是"中士"与"小豆宝"
You heard them. They're "Sarge" and "Pea."

549
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,540
我从没听他们这样称呼对方
Two nicknames I have never heard in my entire life.

550
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,540
我才不信他们俩能这么和谐
This kindness, I don't trust it.

551
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,530
-我懂  暴风雨前的宁静  -对
-I know, it's like a purple sky before a storm.  -Exactly.

552
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,960
美丽宁静  直到你发现鸟儿们惶恐不安
Beautiful, until you realize the birds are agitated

553
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,720
蚂蚁也围成了一个圈
and ants are walking in circles.

554
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,670
那什么
Actually, you know what?

555
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,430
我胃口不太舒服
My -- My stomach's feeling a little weird.

556
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,290
我得去走走  呼吸下新鲜空气
I think I'm gonna take a walk, get a little fresh air.

557
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,500
不准走
Oh, no. You don't --

558
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,020
这次我绝对不会让你跑了
You are not running away this time. No.

559
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,150
放开我  霸道鬼
Let go, bossy!

560
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,340
给我坐下  家人有罪一起受
Sit down. We are gonna suffer like a family!

561
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,260
别抓我  你别拉我的外套
No. Don't -- Don't stretch out my jacket!

562
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,000
我刚减肥到可以穿贴身版的
I just got back into slim fit!

563
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,880
-还好吗  -没事没事
-Is everything all right? -Yeah.

564
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,790
-他没事的  -我只是...
-He's fine. -I just --

565
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,930
是啊  亲爹如你  怎么会关心我呢
Oh, no, of course. Yeah, go get that.

566
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,980
这是怎么了
What's going on?

567
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,530
-没什么啦  -她推的我
-Oh... -She pushed me.

568
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,170
我没推他
I didn't push him.

569
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,190
他只是日常滑倒
He just, you know, slipped, fell.

570
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,740
坐下  你们俩怎么这么多戏
Sit down, sit down. You're causing a scene.

571
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,380
太丢人了
It's very embarrassing.

572
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,620
大小姐  你今天脾气很爆啊
You have been quite rude today, young lady.

573
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,490
跟巴顿将军有一拼
General Patton over there.

574
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,990
{\an8}乔治·巴顿  二战著名美国军事统帅  性格强势

575
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,990
而你  就只会像布景一样傻坐着
And this one is basically a cardboard cutout

576
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,290
偶尔喝口酒  叹声气
who occasionally sip wine and sighs.

577
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,960
我们可没教育你们成为这样的人
We did not raise you to act like this.

578
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,180
-恕我直言  -让我来唱这个红脸
-Oh, excuse me. -No, I-I got it.

579
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,090
你们一直就是这样言传身教的好吗
No, in fact, you raised us to act exactly like this, okay?

580
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,120
你们俩才是今天发神经病的人
You two are the ones that are acting crazy.

581
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,660
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

582
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,820
中士和小豆宝是谁啊
Who the hell are Sarge and Pea,

583
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,810
我们成长时怎么没见过这对神仙眷侣呢
and where were they when we were growing up?

584
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,500
如果是他们俩教养我们长大
Yeah, maybe if those two people had raised us,

585
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,910
那么家里也不会
there would have been room in our house

586
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,830
容不下有血有肉有感情的人
for other people to have emotions

587
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,830
某人就不用搞自闭  封闭感情了
and somebody wouldn't have had to shut himself down.

588
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,160
某人也不会总想着要
And maybe somebody wouldn't be trying

589
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,190
掌控全世界了
to control the whole world

590
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,450
全因为她长大的期间
because she couldn't control the chaos

591
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,090
她控制不了家中的混乱
in her own home growing up.

592
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,110
干嘛
Oh, come on.

593
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,610
我们谁不清楚她的问题在哪
We all know that's what's wrong with her.

594
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,360
-天  -所以
- Oh, God. - So, come on.

595
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,010
你们是不是还欠我们个解释
What do you have to say for yourselves?

596
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,150
-你说的一点没错  -我也承认
- Well, you're not wrong. - True.

597
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,060
-你说什么  -我没听错吧
- I'm -- I'm sorry. One more time. - What?

598
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,630
我们没离婚时  是做得不够好
We didn't behave well when we were married,

599
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,180
我也很内疚
and I feel bad about that.

600
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,050
我也是
Me too.

601
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,120
我们自以为硬不离婚是为了你们
We thought we were staying together for you,

602
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,470
但或许我们逼着你们
but I don't know, maybe we'd forced you

603
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,070
跟两个并不快乐的人相处了太久
to live with two unhappy people for too long.

604
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,720
但我们现在都很幸福
But we're happy now.

605
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:08,090
或许也因此  我们今天才能做最本来的自己
And that's probably why we're able to be our old selves today.

606
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,420
这些话我们早就该说
We should have said this a long time ago,

607
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,010
没能给你们一个快乐的童年
but we didn't give you the kind of home you deserved,

608
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,830
我们真的很抱歉
and for that, we're sorry.

609
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,250
你们不必这样
Well, you -- I mean, there was --

610
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,030
我们也有过幸福的时刻啊
There was happy times, too.

611
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,920
对啊  也不是一直都很疯癫
Yeah, no, it wasn't all crazytown.

612
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,540
-也有开心的时候  -是啊
- It was... - Yeah.

613
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,810
听
Listen.

614
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,080
话都说开了  我们能去跳舞了吗
We're good, right? We can go?

615
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,170
-去吧  -当然
Yes. Of course.

616
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,530
真没想到
Wow. How about that?

617
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,940
他们居然道歉了
An apology.

618
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,660
我从没想过我会如此释然
I don't think I ever thought it would feel so good.

619
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,960
看他们相亲相爱的样子我是很开心的
I do like seeing them happy.

620
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,790
是啊
Yeah.

621
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,850
别哭了
Ohh, you.

622
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,970
你闭嘴
Shut up.

623
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,490
我不像你是机器人
I feel stuff.

624
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,540
我懂啦
I know.

625
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,220
{\an8}歌洛莉亚·迪尔加多
模特代言人

626
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,040
天呐  太牛了
Son of a bitch! That is coconuts!

627
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,520
我还记得你呢
I remember you!

628
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,730
你怀念当模特代言人的时光吗
Do you miss spokesmodeling?

629
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,580
我现在还偶尔做个帆船博览会呢
Aye, I do a boat show every now and then.

630
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,450
我是这么保持还在业界活动的
That's how I keep my hand in it.

631
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,460
快看
Watch, watch.

632
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,120
这是我的绝杀招数
This is how I sealed the deal.

633
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,590
又有一个你
It's you again.
