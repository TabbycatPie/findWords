1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,339
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:13,420
<i>When I was a child, I
saw my mother killed</i>

3
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:15,598
<i>by something impossible.</i>

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,675
<i>My father went to prison for her murder.</i>

5
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:21,882
<i>Then an accident made me the impossible.</i>

6
00:00:21,884 --> 00:00:26,167
<i>To the outside world, I am
an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

7
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:29,512
<i>but secretly, I use my
speed to fight crime</i>

8
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:31,116
<i>and find others like me.</i>

9
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,563
<i>And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother</i>

10
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:36,001
<i>and get justice for my father.</i>

11
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,082
<i>That day is today.</i>

12
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:46,292
What? No Big Belly Burger?

13
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:48,130
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

14
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,799
We're out of cows where I come from.

15
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,742
You don't care about that.
You have questions. Go ahead.

16
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:55,684
Not sure where to start... Thawne.

17
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:58,956
That is your real name... Eobard Thawne.

18
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,694
- Since the day I was born.
- And when was that?

19
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:02,435
136 years from now.

20
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:06,246
That's not what you want to know.

21
00:01:06,248 --> 00:01:09,422
Go ahead, Barry.

22
00:01:09,424 --> 00:01:10,693
Ask it.

23
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:14,569
Why did you kill my mother?

24
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:16,672
Because I hate you.

25
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:18,841
Not you now. You years from now.

26
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:22,013
- In the future.
- In a future. Yes.

27
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,883
We're enemies, rivals, opposites,

28
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:25,151
reverses of one another.

29
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:26,988
Why? Wh-why were we enemies?

30
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,428
It doesn't matter.

31
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,299
It doesn't... matter anymore.

32
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,171
What matters is that
neither of us was strong enough

33
00:01:34,173 --> 00:01:37,142
to defeat the other.

34
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:39,814
Until I learned your secret.

35
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:42,488
I learned your name.

36
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,291
Barry Allen.

37
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:49,130
And finally, I knew how
to defeat you once and for all.

38
00:01:49,132 --> 00:01:53,005
Travel back in time, kill you as a child.

39
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,845
Wipe you from the face of the earth.

40
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:59,856
But then you, future you,
that is, followed me back,

41
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:01,826
and we fought.

42
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:05,765
We both landed some pretty solid shots.

43
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:10,509
And then you, future you, got
your younger self out of there.

44
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:13,382
I was so mad.

45
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,055
But then I thought...

46
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:21,663
what if you were to suffer a tragedy?

47
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:25,535
What if you were to suffer
something so horrible,

48
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:28,039
so traumatic that your child
self could never recover?

49
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,478
Then you would not become The Flash.

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,815
And so I stabbed your
mother in the heart,

51
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:35,517
and I was free.

52
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,357
Finally able to return
to a future without The Flash,

53
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,529
only to realize that in traveling back

54
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:46,333
I'd lost my way home.

55
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:49,536
Lost my ability to
harness the speed force.

56
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:53,074
And without it, I was stuck here.

57
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:56,146
Stranded in this time,
unable to return to my own.

58
00:02:56,148 --> 00:03:00,680
And the only way back was The Flash.

59
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:04,280
But The Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

60
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,480
Why train me?

61
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,213
Why help me save so many people?

62
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:17,881
Because I needed you to get fast.

63
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:22,480
Fast enough to rupture
the space-time barrier

64
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:24,416
and create a stable wormhole

65
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:27,352
through which I could return home.

66
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:28,953
Why would I ever do that?

67
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:30,519
Because...

68
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:35,861
Barry Allen, if you give me what I want,

69
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:38,064
I'm gonna give you what you want.

70
00:03:40,364 --> 00:03:43,400
You can go back and save your mother.

71
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:46,373
You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

72
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:50,408
You can reunite the Allen family.

73
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:55,016
No.

74
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,452
No, I don't believe you.

75
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,988
I want to kill you right now.

76
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,758
I know that rage.

77
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,227
I used to feel that rage
every time I looked upon you.

78
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:10,262
And now, somehow,

79
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:15,363
I know what Joe and Henry feel

80
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:18,402
when they look on you with pride.

81
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:19,637
With love.

82
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,870
No. No.

83
00:04:20,872 --> 00:04:23,804
Don't you ever say that to me!

84
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,574
I know you're upset,

85
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:28,975
but I'm giving you a chance.

86
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:34,811
I'm giving you a chance to undo
all the evil I've done.

87
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:37,080
Don't you want that chance?

88
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:55,295
The rare opportunity to go
back in time and right a wrong

89
00:04:55,297 --> 00:04:58,499
and save your mother's life...

90
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:01,532
quite the paradox Harrison has
presented you with, Mr. Allen.

91
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,437
The chance to be with someone you love?

92
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,441
Seems pretty cut and dry to me.

93
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:09,108
(Stein) At first blush,
Dr. Snow, it would appear so,

94
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,314
but this gift has unparalleled risk.

95
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,383
Barry, the night your mother died,

96
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:18,421
the night you saved yourself
from being killed,

97
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:23,127
that event altered the timeline
you were already on

98
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:25,464
and changed the course of history.

99
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:28,933
So what you're saying is we're
living in a parallel universe?

100
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:31,070
Just like when I time traveled before.

101
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,573
But he... he only changed
one day that time.

102
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:39,446
Exactly. Now imagine 15 years
of compounded experiences.

103
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:41,580
One different decision,
no matter how big or small,

104
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:43,883
impacts everything that follows.

105
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,855
Moments upon moments,
choices upon choices.

106
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:51,495
No relationships,
nothing would be as it is today,

107
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:52,964
and you'd never know the difference

108
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:56,065
because you'd never remember any of it.

109
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:03,070
So if I go back and save my mom,

110
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:06,710
my dad doesn't go to prison.

111
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:10,141
I never live with Joe and Iris.

112
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:15,482
You might never meet me.
Or Caitlin or Ronnie.

113
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:19,518
Truth is, there's no real way

114
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,052
of knowing what your life will be.

115
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:30,927
There's no choice here, Barry.
You have to do this.

116
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:33,298
You gotta change the past.

117
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:42,073
Joe?

118
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:45,946
So what... what, that's it?

119
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,652
You think I should just do it?

120
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:53,554
Yeah, I do.

121
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:57,056
Which means I will never
come to live with you, and...

122
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:59,392
you're okay with that?

123
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:03,065
Barry, you get the chance
to grow up with both parents.

124
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:05,199
You don't have to grow
up without a mother.

125
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:06,733
What about growing up without a father?

126
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:11,606
You will have a father...
your real father.

127
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:15,609
Wells has messed with our lives
long enough.

128
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:18,481
This is why you became The Flash, Barry.

129
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:20,652
To put things right.

130
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:25,792
You saved a lot of
people's lives this past year.

131
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:27,495
Now it's time to save yours.

132
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:51,423
(Barry) Dad, look. I
know this sounds crazy.

133
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:53,956
I think we're way past crazy, slugger.

134
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:58,292
Look, you're fast, I get it.
But turning back time...

135
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:00,461
No, I wouldn't be turning time back.

136
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:04,299
I would be... going back

137
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:06,835
to that night to save her.

138
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:10,369
And what does Joe think about all this?

139
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,804
[chuckles]

140
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:14,639
He thinks I should do it.

141
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:16,742
No.

142
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:18,311
You can't.

143
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:23,384
Dad...

144
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:28,826
I can make it so that night
will never have happened.

145
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:30,128
We'll be a family again.

146
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,696
We are a family.

147
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:34,632
Not like this. Not without Mom.

148
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:39,634
Barry, there's a natural order
to things, okay?

149
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:41,303
Things happen the way they do.

150
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:43,438
We may not know why at the time,

151
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,640
but there must always be a reason.

152
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:48,944
Now, I believe that.
I've had to believe it.

153
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:53,616
I... I can save Mom.

154
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:56,151
At what cost?

155
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:58,619
You said time would change.
What if it changes you?

156
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,955
- I don't care.
- I do.

157
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:06,730
I am in awe

158
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:11,203
of the remarkable man
that you are becoming...

159
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:14,573
all the things you've achieved,
and not just as The Flash,

160
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:15,941
but you, Barry.

161
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:18,710
Your honesty. Your heart.

162
00:09:20,814 --> 00:09:23,045
You were always a hero.

163
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:26,714
And your mom would be just as proud.

164
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,852
And if she had a say in this,

165
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:31,087
if she thought for one second
that you going back to save her

166
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:33,823
would mean you losing
what makes you so special,

167
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:36,062
she would never want that.

168
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:38,866
[crying]

169
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:42,837
Barry, what I hope for you,

170
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,273
maybe the greatest thing that
a father can hope for his son

171
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:51,748
is that one day, you will become
a father yourself.

172
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,920
And then you will know...

173
00:09:57,256 --> 00:10:01,592
How much I truly love you.

174
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:06,932
[thermometer beeps]

175
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:09,667
(Caitlin) 98.6. Normal.

176
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,535
I don't even know
what that word means anymore.

177
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:13,304
Me neither.

178
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:14,605
I know Barry really appreciates you

179
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:16,303
coming back to help him stop Wells.

180
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:18,806
That's not the only
reason I'm back, Cait.

181
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:20,673
I'm here now. For good.

182
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:22,339
But I thought...

183
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:25,006
I thought too... I thought too much

184
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:27,907
about what might happen if
the government tracked us down.

185
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:30,210
If we couldn't control
our powers and we hurt someone.

186
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,414
If we hurt you.

187
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:39,582
But I realized that although
sometimes I'm more than one man,

188
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:42,087
I'm not whole unless I'm with you.

189
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,225
I love you, Cait.

190
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:50,098
- Are you sure?
- I am.

191
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,936
Once upon a time and a
Particle Accelerator or so ago,

192
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:55,903
you agreed to marry me.

193
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,736
Yes, I did.

194
00:10:57,738 --> 00:11:00,105
What do you say we do that?

195
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:10,814
Thought I might find you here.

196
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,651
I needed to get out of the lab.

197
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:19,655
[sighs]

198
00:11:19,657 --> 00:11:21,754
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

199
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:23,291
Oh, it is. Trust me.

200
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:27,396
I've done a lot of thinking up here.

201
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:29,032
When I wasn't having clandestine meetings

202
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:31,534
with the mysterious "streak."

203
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:33,235
[both chuckle]

204
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:36,740
Yeah, not mad we lost that name.

205
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:39,244
Hey, I thought that had pizzazz.

206
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:41,078
[both laugh]

207
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,513
- No.
- Uh-uh.

208
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:49,321
[gentle music]

209
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:51,758
So are you gonna do it?

210
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:58,266
It's just so... huge.

211
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:00,001
It's the biggest decision of my life,

212
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:04,001
and if I'm wrong, I can't undo it.

213
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:05,872
Why would you want to?

214
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:11,707
I mean, you'd get to see
your mom again, your dad,

215
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:14,678
have a great career,

216
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,510
even get married.

217
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:21,746
Iris West-Allen, huh?

218
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:24,447
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

219
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:27,683
Must be a 2024 thing. [chuckles]

220
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:31,853
We don't know that
that's going to happen.

221
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:37,059
Do you think that because you
didn't live with us,

222
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:39,295
that's why things are different there?

223
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:42,297
Growing up together and...

224
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:47,475
knowing so much about each other...

225
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:51,710
it made it hard for me to admit
how I felt about you.

226
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:56,853
And I waited too long, and you
fell in love with Eddie.

227
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:03,993
But living with you and Joe...

228
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:09,531
I've had a great life, Iris.

229
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,336
Come here, Barry.

230
00:13:19,436 --> 00:13:23,175
What do you think I should do?

231
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,244
I need someone to tell me.

232
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:32,514
I think...

233
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:36,045
that for once in your life, Barry Allen,

234
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:38,714
you should stop thinking
about other people.

235
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:41,986
I think you should do
what's in your heart.

236
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,587
Do what you need to do for yourself.

237
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:54,794
(Wells) Ah!

238
00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:57,866
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

239
00:13:57,868 --> 00:13:59,368
it took you a whole hour longer to decide

240
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,337
than I thought it would.

241
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,073
So how does this work?

242
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:06,743
Your grand plan?

243
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,049
Well, it's really not
that grand at all, Barry.

244
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:10,717
In fact, it's rather simple.

245
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,219
We use the Particle Accelerator.

246
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:13,821
[laughs] The Particle Accelerator.

247
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:16,693
The last time that happened,
you caused an explosion

248
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:18,293
that hurt a lot of people.

249
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:21,598
This time, the accelerator
will operate exactly

250
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,367
the way it was designed to.

251
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:27,840
Except, instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions,

252
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:29,908
colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring,

253
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,445
we're only going to inject one particle

254
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,448
into the accelerator.

255
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:37,583
And I'm what it collides with.

256
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,918
And if you can go fast enough, Barry,

257
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,555
if you can hit that particle
with enough speed,

258
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:46,856
you will punch a hole right
though the fabric of reality.

259
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:50,791
And you will create a portal
connecting this time

260
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:53,461
to infinite times.

261
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:55,062
A wormhole.

262
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:58,635
Through which one might travel
back to the past, say,

263
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:02,640
to the night your mother died or
forward to the future, to, say,

264
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:05,277
my time.

265
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,681
You said<i> if</i> I run fast enough.

266
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:10,384
What happens if I don't?

267
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:13,956
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity barrier,

268
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,391
you'll die.

269
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:23,076
According to Wells' calculations,

270
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:25,713
Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

271
00:15:25,715 --> 00:15:28,417
Once Barry reaches optimum speed,

272
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:32,054
we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

273
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,557
Once the collision happens,
a wormhole forms,

274
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,893
opening a gateway into time itself.

275
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:42,129
It's at that moment
I plan on shouting something

276
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:45,029
along the lines of "Eureka"
or possibly "Excelsior."

277
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:47,331
I'm uncommitted.

278
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,799
What do you think?

279
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:52,832
[sighs] I mean, on the one hand,

280
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,900
it does make a kind of sense.

281
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:56,601
On the other hand,

282
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:57,936
why?

283
00:15:57,938 --> 00:16:00,707
Why, why would you ever
consider doing this?

284
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,440
You know why.

285
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:05,141
So, for this to actually work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

286
00:16:05,143 --> 00:16:09,214
By my estimates, Mach Two at a minimum.

287
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:11,248
You've never gone that fast.

288
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,151
So what happens if Barry
doesn't reach that speed?

289
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:16,620
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield.

290
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:18,721
How far off am I?

291
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:20,789
Not very far, I'm afraid.

292
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,428
Let me worry about how fast I have to go.

293
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,629
We're gonna need something else too.

294
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,664
Really? And what's that?

295
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,531
'Cause I don't know about you guys,

296
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:33,364
but I'm not at all interested in
helping you get yourself killed.

297
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:36,599
I need you to build a time machine.

298
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:39,202
Go on.

299
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:41,040
So, if Wells is as fast as you,

300
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,044
what's he need a time machine for?

301
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:45,713
Apparently he lost his speed
when he killed my mom.

302
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:48,448
He gets it back sometimes
but only in spurts.

303
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,650
He can't fully control it.

304
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:50,953
So I was right about the wheelchair.

305
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:52,755
He was using it to charge himself.

306
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:54,823
So after I open the wormhole,
he's gonna need the ship

307
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:57,395
to travel back to the future.

308
00:16:57,397 --> 00:16:59,200
He's been squirreling away the parts.

309
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:01,000
Now we just need to put it together.

310
00:17:01,002 --> 00:17:04,238
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine,

311
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,975
not a bookcase from IKEA.

312
00:17:05,977 --> 00:17:07,709
We got a problem.

313
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:09,377
These tiles... they're made of tungsten.

314
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:10,610
Well, tungsten does have
the highest melting point

315
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,012
of any other element.

316
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,216
Yeah, but the dust
it generates is flammable.

317
00:17:14,218 --> 00:17:15,852
The pressure exerted from the wormhole...

318
00:17:15,854 --> 00:17:17,355
Yeah. Yeah.

319
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:20,294
It could cause a hole to be
melted into the exterior.

320
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:22,665
It could explode.

321
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,437
Any ideas?

322
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,040
Let me ask Dr. Evil. [chuckles]

323
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:29,942
Which used to be a name
that made me smile.

324
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:37,683
(Wells) Something on your mind, Cisco?

325
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:39,921
No.

326
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:41,190
Yes.

327
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:43,926
How did you fit your Reverse-Flash suit

328
00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:45,360
into that little ring?

329
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:47,560
Is it some sort of compressed micro tech?

330
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:50,992
Or actually, forget it. I don't care.

331
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:54,761
Maybe a little.

332
00:17:54,763 --> 00:17:56,261
Ronnie's right.

333
00:17:56,263 --> 00:17:58,229
I should have accounted
for the temporal shearing.

334
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:00,566
Glad we're still good for something.

335
00:18:00,568 --> 00:18:04,467
I never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

336
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:05,734
Or Ronnie's.

337
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,434
As a matter of fact,

338
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:11,069
do you know how many times
I wished you were there with me

339
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,402
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

340
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:13,469
It would have been a lot more fun.

341
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:14,635
Yeah?

342
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:16,337
Well, doesn't change the fact

343
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:19,040
that your nifty little Time Sphere...

344
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:20,539
Is that what you're calling it?

345
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,137
Whatever it's called. It's gonna blow.

346
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:24,404
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

347
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:27,806
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

348
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,943
Okay. Fine. We'll try that.

349
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:32,311
(Wells) That's it? That's all?

350
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:33,411
Well, what do you want me to say?

351
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,243
I don't know, Cisco.

352
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:36,643
I thought that of anyone, you'd
be a little more understanding

353
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:37,676
of my predicament.

354
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:39,979
I don't belong here.

355
00:18:39,981 --> 00:18:43,216
These barbaric times.

356
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:44,817
It's like living amongst the dead.

357
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,521
Is that what you told yourself?
When you killed me?

358
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:53,756
What?

359
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,291
What did you say?

360
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:59,765
It was an alternate timeline.

361
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,933
One that Barry reset.

362
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:03,634
But I never forgot it.

363
00:19:03,636 --> 00:19:07,470
It just kept coming back to me.

364
00:19:07,472 --> 00:19:10,507
And I can still picture

365
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:13,005
the way you looked at me

366
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:15,740
when you called me a son

367
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:20,678
and you crushed my heart with your fist.

368
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,846
Cisco...

369
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:25,011
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:28,011
Yeah. It sucked.

371
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:29,946
Not for killing you.
I'm sure I had a good reason.

372
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:31,848
I'm sorry for the fact that
you're able to retain traces

373
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,549
of another timeline.

374
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:36,650
You're able to see through
the vibrations of the universe.

375
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:39,050
It means...

376
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,785
I wasn't sure until just now.

377
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:43,053
Sure of what?

378
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:48,991
The night the Particle
Accelerator exploded...

379
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:54,298
You were affected too.

380
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:59,334
What are you talking about?

381
00:20:01,173 --> 00:20:02,373
No.

382
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:06,308
I wasn't.

383
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,045
Don't be afraid, Cisco.

384
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:14,685
A great and honorable destiny
awaits you now.

385
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:20,029
I only hope that as you're
living your great adventure,

386
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:22,864
that you remember who gave you that life.

387
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,573
And that it was given out of love.

388
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:31,477
[ominous music]

389
00:20:43,898 --> 00:20:45,434
I'm sorry, but I'm told
this is the only station

390
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:47,770
with enough power
to run these calculations.

391
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,737
If we make the slightest error
creating the wormhole...

392
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,305
Say no more.

393
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:52,973
Joe told me to stick around
in case I was needed,

394
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:54,273
but it seems I'm only in the way.

395
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:58,276
Everyone has a contribution to make.

396
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:00,579
Perhaps you just haven't
discovered yours yet.

397
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:02,412
No, Dr. Wells made it
pretty clear when he told me

398
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:03,712
about the future.

399
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:05,447
I don't matter.

400
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:06,716
As far as history's concerned,

401
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:09,586
I don't save the day or get the girl.

402
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:12,122
And you believed him?

403
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:15,625
He had a newspaper from the year 2024.

404
00:21:15,627 --> 00:21:18,958
And I have a mug that says
"World's Best Boss."

405
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,762
I doubt my teaching
assistant would testify

406
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:25,267
to its authenticity.

407
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:31,209
We're dealing with a lot
of big scientific ideas today.

408
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:35,583
But you, Mr. Thawne, might be
the most interesting thing here

409
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,117
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

410
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,085
Me?

411
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:42,258
What are the odds that Dr. Wells
would travel back in time

412
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,496
and get stuck in the exact same city

413
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:47,568
as his great-great-great-
great-grandfather?

414
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,041
Working in the same profession,
the same building?

415
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,115
And that part of his plan
to get home would mean

416
00:21:54,117 --> 00:21:58,320
that he'd have to preserve
and protect your life.

417
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:04,026
That makes you this rare thing
that no scientist can plan for.

418
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:06,230
Which is?

419
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:08,497
Coincidence.

420
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:13,467
There is no science to coincidence.

421
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:16,802
You, sir, are an anomaly.

422
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:20,604
A wild card, as it were.

423
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:23,472
You are the only person
in this whole story

424
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:27,241
who gets to choose his own future.

425
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:30,240
At least, that's my opinion.

426
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:32,107
[computer blips]

427
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:34,376
Wait, that can't be right.

428
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:36,912
Oh, dear.

429
00:22:36,914 --> 00:22:39,076
- We have a problem.
- What?

430
00:22:39,078 --> 00:22:41,280
(Stein) The calculations.
There is a danger.

431
00:22:41,282 --> 00:22:43,748
I know. I'm ready to take the risk.

432
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,749
No, not just to you but to everyone.

433
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:48,316
Wells didn't tell us everything.

434
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:51,819
Barry, even if you do reach
the right speed,

435
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:53,789
colliding with the hydrogen particle,

436
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:58,894
there is a chance that explosion
could create a singularity.

437
00:22:58,896 --> 00:22:59,895
What's a singularity?

438
00:22:59,897 --> 00:23:00,930
It's a black hole.

439
00:23:00,932 --> 00:23:02,832
We could destroy Central City.

440
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:04,499
For starters.

441
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:09,439
If we create a singularity here
and then cannot control it,

442
00:23:09,441 --> 00:23:13,613
we could be looking
at a global catastrophe.

443
00:23:13,615 --> 00:23:17,784
So long and thanks for all the fish.

444
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:24,015
(Wells) Well, sure,
there's a bit of a risk.

445
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:25,617
(Stein) I would hardly
refer to possibly causing

446
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:28,315
an extinction-level event as
"a bit of a risk."

447
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:30,086
(West) Yeah, and your accelerator's

448
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:32,757
been about as reliable as the
beater I drove in high school.

449
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:33,758
[chuckles]

450
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,758
Let me ask you a question.

451
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,330
How many meta-humans...

452
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:39,566
how many dangers...

453
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:43,040
have we faced this year together?

454
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:45,476
Or did you forget that was me

455
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:47,811
fighting alongside
each and every one of you?

456
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:50,313
I have been planning this
for almost two decades.

457
00:23:50,315 --> 00:23:51,947
It will work.

458
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:53,781
And how do we make sure
we don't open a black hole

459
00:23:53,783 --> 00:23:55,251
in the middle of Central City?

460
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:57,850
So, once the wormhole stabilizes,

461
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:01,819
Barry will have 1 minute
and 52 seconds to alter the past

462
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:03,621
and return to this time.

463
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:05,221
If and when he does that,

464
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:07,421
you can close the wormhole,

465
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:09,222
and we can all live happily ever after.

466
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:10,623
Almost two minutes.

467
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,825
More than enough time to save Nora.

468
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:16,060
But not enough time
to stop you from going home?

469
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:18,262
Everything's a choice.

470
00:24:18,264 --> 00:24:20,531
And what if I'm late?

471
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:23,035
You won't be. I believe in you, Barry.

472
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:24,037
Always have.

473
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,807
So I guess the question is,

474
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,510
do your friends and family
believe in you as much as I do?

475
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:43,263
[sighs]

476
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:48,202
[laughs]

477
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:52,541
So, if I don't run fast enough
to collide with the particle,

478
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:54,979
then I'm dust, and if
I do run fast enough

479
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:56,681
but I'm not back here in time,
then a black hole will form,

480
00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:59,315
swallow up the city and
possibly the world.

481
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:02,553
You're sure you still want to
look me in the eyes and tell me

482
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:04,755
this is for the best?

483
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,921
I'd be lying if I told you I did.

484
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,126
[laughs]

485
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:14,028
Truth is, I don't...
I don't know what to think.

486
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,263
I thought you were the sure one.

487
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,399
I...

488
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:19,099
was kind of banking on that
when I made my decision

489
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,800
the first time.

490
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:23,839
I was faking it.

491
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:25,074
Sometimes parents do that.

492
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:28,242
Most of the time, parents do that.

493
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,350
Look, of course I'm scared.

494
00:25:34,886 --> 00:25:37,720
But I didn't want you to not
help your mother

495
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:39,356
because you were worried about me.

496
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:41,795
Well, I'll always worry about you, Joe,

497
00:25:41,797 --> 00:25:44,130
just like you'll always worry about me.

498
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:46,699
Sorry, but you can't stop that.

499
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:50,635
[sighs]

500
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:55,008
Do you think I can do this?

501
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,274
You think I can save my mom?

502
00:25:58,276 --> 00:25:59,944
I mean, do you think I'm fast enough?

503
00:25:59,946 --> 00:26:01,178
Yes.

504
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,213
I know you are.

505
00:26:07,552 --> 00:26:12,525
You know, I've... I've dreamed
my whole life about...

506
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,990
saving her,

507
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:18,459
freeing my dad, and...

508
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:20,729
I never thought I'd have to lose
another parent to do that.

509
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:22,063
Barry...

510
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:25,497
Joe, it's true. It's true.

511
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:27,968
I've always been so focused on everything

512
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:33,374
that I lost that night,
but I gained so much too.

513
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:38,011
I was born with one father,
and that tragedy gave me...

514
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,845
another.

515
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:44,484
And I don't think I can lose you.

516
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:47,154
You won't ever lose me.

517
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:50,156
Ever, you hear me?

518
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:52,057
Ever.

519
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:01,735
Wow, slow news day?

520
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:07,410
If they only knew, right?

521
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:10,847
I thought you would be at S.T.A.R. Labs.

522
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,382
I was.

523
00:27:12,384 --> 00:27:14,385
Then I got hungry, so
I went to Mama Chows.

524
00:27:14,387 --> 00:27:17,821
For dim sum? Your favorite.

525
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:20,023
And to remind myself of something.

526
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:21,257
What?

527
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:30,003
A coincidence. A pretty big
coincidence, actually.

528
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:33,775
About a year and a half ago,
I had a date with this girl.

529
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:37,577
Katie Rogers. She was a dancer.

530
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:39,912
We had plans to meet at Mama Chows,

531
00:27:39,914 --> 00:27:41,314
but she texted me.

532
00:27:41,316 --> 00:27:42,714
She pulled a hamstring and had to cancel.

533
00:27:42,716 --> 00:27:45,381

00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:23,189
[shouts]

720
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,066
Three, two, one.

721
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,235
Ronnie, are you okay?

722
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,636
[grunts] Did you do it?

723
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:35,238
Yes, I turned them all off.

724
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:40,081
They did it. They cut the generator.

725
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:42,384
[grunting]

726
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:46,720
Just so we're clear,

727
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:48,055
after I kill you,

728
00:39:48,057 --> 00:39:49,824
I'm going to kill them.

729
00:39:49,826 --> 00:39:51,928
And then I'm going to kill your father.

730
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,097
I always win, Flash.

731
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:56,432
[gunshot]

732
00:40:01,842 --> 00:40:04,408
[screams] Eddie! Oh, my...

733
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:06,876
(West) Eddie!

734
00:40:06,878 --> 00:40:08,581
What did you do?

735
00:40:10,384 --> 00:40:14,850
What did you do? What did you do?

736
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:17,722
No such thing as a coincidence.

737
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:21,990
What's happening?

738
00:40:21,992 --> 00:40:23,791
Cisco, help me.

739
00:40:23,793 --> 00:40:26,427
Eddie's his ancestor.

740
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:28,995
If Eddie dies, he'll
never be born, and...

741
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,399
He's being erased from existence.

742
00:40:35,303 --> 00:40:38,670
No! No! Eddie.

743
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:40,135
Eddie, no, no.

744
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,270
Stay with me, okay? Stay.

745
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:44,336
[crying]

746
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:47,071
He was wrong, it turns out.

747
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:48,673
I'm a hero after all.

748
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:51,809
You are, Eddie. You are my hero.

749
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:55,045
That's all I ever wanted to be.

750
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:56,680
Your hero.

751
00:40:58,752 --> 00:41:00,285
[gasps]

752
00:41:02,923 --> 00:41:04,490
No!

753
00:41:07,628 --> 00:41:11,296
[Iris cries]

754
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:13,899
I've controlled your life
for so long, Barry.

755
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:17,003
How will you get along without me?

756
00:41:21,841 --> 00:41:25,076
[screams]

757
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,468
Guys, that's not good.

758
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,202
Professor, I shut down the wormhole.

759
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,272
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

760
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:51,806
You did close it,
but it seems to be reopening.

761
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:53,274
We got to go.

762
00:41:53,276 --> 00:41:55,808
You okay?

763
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,178
Iris, we have to go.

764
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,918
I'm not leaving him.

765
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,319
We have to go now, honey. I'm sorry.

766
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:20,638
So that's what we didn't want to happen.

767
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,507
- What's it doing?
- Feeding.

768
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:26,679
A singularity won't stop, not
even after the earth is gone.

769
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:29,913
- [tires screech]
- [people screaming]

770
00:42:46,866 --> 00:42:49,401
I'm afraid the accretion disc
has already assembled.

771
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:50,402
What?

772
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,002
The diffuse material

773
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:53,670
that's in orbital motion
around the singularity.

774
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:54,704
What does that mean?

775
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:56,773
We have to disrupt the motion.

776
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:59,846
Basically it's just like
the tornado, only upside down.

777
00:42:59,848 --> 00:43:01,349
And bigger.

778
00:43:01,351 --> 00:43:03,115
And scarier.

779
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:04,916
Barry, that event has an energy level

780
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,421
of at least 6.7 Tera Electron Volts.

781
00:43:07,423 --> 00:43:08,923
It cannot be stopped.

782
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,998
I have to try.

783
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,901
[dramatic choral music]

784
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,546
Oh, God.

785
00:43:39,548 --> 00:43:41,617
Barry.

786
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,554
[heroic music]
