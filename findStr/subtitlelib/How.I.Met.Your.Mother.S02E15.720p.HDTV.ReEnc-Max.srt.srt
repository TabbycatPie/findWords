1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:03,578
Kids, never underestimate
the power of destiny.

2
00:00:03,988 --> 00:00:06,408
Because when you least expect it,
the littlest thing

3
00:00:06,418 --> 00:00:08,808
can cause a ripple effect
that changes your life.

4
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,682
Take for instance
my trip to Chicago.

5
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:14,493
That security guard was
a little bit handsy.

6
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:16,392
That's funny.
She barely touched me.

7
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:18,661
Uh, Gate 23. Come on.

8
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:21,264
If we miss this flight,
I will never forgive myself.

9
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:23,819
Why was this flight
so important?

10
00:00:23,854 --> 00:00:26,994
Let's back up a few months
to the fall of 2006.

11
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,582
I had just sold my first
building design and become

12
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:32,365
the youngest project manager
in my firm's history.

13
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,611
Suddenly I was
being headhunted.

14
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:38,178
One firm was even considering me to
run their entire New York office.

15
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:40,326
They were flying me in
for a final interview

16
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:42,386
at their corporate
headquarters in Chicago.

17
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:44,344
It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.

18
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:45,784
It was my destiny.

19
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:47,524
There was just one problem.

20
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:49,645
Hi, wait, two more.

21
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:51,485
Sorry, you're too late,
I already shut the doors.

22
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:53,754
Well, I'm sure if we pull
real hard we can open them.

23
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:56,694
Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but
see, once I close those doors,
that's it.

24
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,854
Nobody else is allowed
down that jet-way.

25
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:01,017
Except for that guy.

26
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:06,184
Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss
the chance to interview for my dream job.

27
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:07,306
I'm sorry, sir.

28
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:09,515
His dream job!
Didn't you ever have a dream job?

29
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:12,847
Something from when you were a little
girl, that was all you wanted to do?

30
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,026
I mean, for God's sakes,
I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night

31
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:16,625
dreaming about being a...

32
00:01:17,354 --> 00:01:19,004
I mean, uh...

33
00:01:19,386 --> 00:01:21,106
This is a cool job.

34
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,914
Please, I have to
be on this flight.

35
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:25,304
I'll see what I can do.

36
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:26,695
But it doesn't look good.

37
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:27,606
Thanks.

38
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:30,454
Your uniforms are pretty.

39
00:01:33,773 --> 00:01:36,273
Sync by vNaru

40
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:49,265
Okay.

41
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,743
They haven't armed the doors yet,
so you still have a chance.

42
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,545
Sure, and for the future,
we recommend you arrive

43
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:01,165
at the airport an hour and
a half before your flight,

44
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:03,123
not, you know,
one minute after.

45
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,803
Normally, I'm
incredibly responsible.

46
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:07,134
I just had to go to court this
morning and get sentenced.

47
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,685
Not that I'm a
criminal or anything.

48
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:11,723
Yeah, he just jumped
a subway turnstile.

49
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:15,005
You seem to have a lot of problems
with the rules of travel.

50
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:17,895
Hello?

51
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,726
Oh, that is great news.

52
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:24,826
It's my mom--
she found her missing earring.

53
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:26,835
Have a seat.
I'll call you when I hear something.

54
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,126
Where was it?

55
00:02:29,163 --> 00:02:30,743
That thing better
have call waiting.

56
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:33,324
Could you just call the firm
and explain what happened?

57
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,656
It's down to three people

58
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:36,834
and I know they need to
make their decision today.

59
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:40,224
I sort of feel my not showing up
might put me at a disadvantage.

60
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:43,103
I'm so stupid.

61
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:45,213
Why did I have to
jump that turnstile?

62
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:47,913
Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself.

63
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:50,786
And isn't this whole thing
really Barney's fault?

64
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:52,256
She had a point.

65
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,063
It was kind of Barney's fault.

66
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:55,845
Let's back up a few months.

67
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:58,464
Oh, Marshall,
how's the broken toe?

68
00:02:58,473 --> 00:03:00,063
Oh, man, it kills.

69
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:01,656
You want some aspirin, baby?

70
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:03,776
You know I don't
believe in pain killers.

71
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:08,154
Wow, your first broken bone.

72
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:10,054
Kind of kills your whole
"Unbreakable" theory.

73
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,756
Marshall used to think
he was indestructible.

74
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,236
Well, it added up.
I've never broken anything.

75
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,895
I've never been sick,
and when I need to,

76
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:19,404
I can summon
incredible strength.

77
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:22,176
Ted, tell her the story
of the really heavy door.

78
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:24,054
There was a really heavy door.

79
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,456
He opened it.

80
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:27,636
On one pull.

81
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:32,164
Well, you must be really bummed, you're
not gonna be able to run tomorrow.

82
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:33,573
Yeah. It sucks,

83
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:36,954
all that work I put in training
for the marathon was a total waste.

84
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:38,893
Training for a marathon.

85
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:41,375
What?

86
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:44,215
You don't need to train for a marathon.
You just run it.

87
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:46,013
You're kidding, right?

88
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,776
Not at all. I could run a
marathon anytime I wanted to.

89
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,725
So like tomorrow, you think you
could wake up, roll out of bed,

90
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:53,514
and just run the New
York City Marathon?

91
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,695
Absolutely.

92
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:57,763
Barney, we're talking
about 42 kilometers.

93
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:00,216
Thanks, Canada.
I'll take it from here.

94
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,366
Barney, it's like 26 miles.

95
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:04,206
Here's how you run a marathon.

96
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,833
Step one, you start running.

97
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:09,083
There is no step two.

98
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:11,763
Okay, you know what? Prove it.

99
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:13,755
Take my number and
run in my place.

100
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:17,163
I will bet you 50 bucks you
don't even finish the race.

101
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,513
50 bucks?

102
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:20,403
Gee, Grandpa, if I win,

103
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,946
maybe I can buy myself
an ice-cream cone.

104
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:25,584
Make it $10,000.

105
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:27,936
You have a gambling problem.
You'll bet me 50.

106
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:29,415
Fine, then no bet.

107
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,895
Okay, $50.

108
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:35,673
The next morning,
as the marathon began,

109
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:37,866
we were focused on
Marshall's computer.

110
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:40,443
Each runner gets a tracking chip
so you can follow them online,

111
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:43,453
see when they pass certain checkpoints.
Barney's got mine in his shoe.

112
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:45,413
Ooh, he's starting!

113
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:47,364
This ought to be good.

114
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:53,774
Wow.

115
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,893
He's already passing
the second checkpoint.

116
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:59,303
This tracking thing is amazing.

117
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:01,656
When we get married,
you're getting one of these.

118
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:10,433
Wow. Look at his time.
It's pretty impressive.

119
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:12,535
He's gotta be cheating, okay.

120
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:13,756
He knew we'd check.

121
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:15,375
Yeah, he'll do
anything to win a bet.

122
00:05:15,393 --> 00:05:18,843
Remember that time he bet me that Men
at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf,"

123
00:05:18,855 --> 00:05:21,445
and when he found out that they didn't,
he tried to hire them to?

124
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:24,886
Well, it looks like, "Barney" should
be coming over the Queensboro Bridge

125
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:28,136
and up First Avenue within
the next hour or so. But...

126
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:30,693
there is no way that
that's really him.

127
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:32,165
It's really him.

128
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:41,794
Hey! That's mine.

129
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,896
Yeah, you'd better run!

130
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:50,125
- What up, non-finishers?
- Wow.

131
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:52,426
- Very impressive, Barney.
- Right?

132
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:54,274
Yeah, my time would have been
like a half an hour better,

133
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:57,264
but I met this total hottie on
Mile Seven. We took a quick detour

134
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,834
and had our own mini
marathon behind a Nathan's.

135
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:01,026
I won.

136
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:04,616
I'm not sure anyone in
that story is a winner.

137
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,893
So where's my 50 bucks?

138
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:09,176
All right.

139
00:06:10,193 --> 00:06:13,183
I got to admit,
you earned this.

140
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:17,983
Huh? Can't believe they haven't
made a coin for this yet.

141
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:19,991
Anyway, I'm heading home.

142
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:21,934
Might go hit the gym.

143
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,840
Oh, hey, just so you know,
uh, all marathon runners get

144
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:26,557
to use the subway
for free today.

145
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:29,926
Wow. You know I really should
check out this "subway."

146
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:31,296
Heard so much about it.

147
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,683
Wow. Look at me. Slumming it.

148
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:36,535
Maybe I'll make a
weekend out of it

149
00:06:36,556 --> 00:06:39,026
and I'll call my bridge
and tunnel girl tonight.

150
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:41,125
You're dating a girl
from New Jersey?

151
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:42,473
No.

152
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:47,704
So Barney did it.

153
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:49,156
He actually finished
the marathon.

154
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:52,613
But a little while later...
I got an interesting phone call.

155
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:54,324
- Hello?
- Ted, it's Barney.

156
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,754
Listen to me, I need you to come
and pick me up on the subway.

157
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,485
What, what are
you talking about?

158
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:01,396
I was sitting here,
totally minding my own business.

159
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:08,886
Finisher.

160
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:12,016
Yeah, you know what I mean.

161
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,023
86th street.

162
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:37,873
My legs don't work.

163
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:40,895
I've already ridden the
subway twice end to end.

164
00:07:40,913 --> 00:07:42,993
I've seen where
it turns around.

165
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:46,483
Ted, you don't ever want to see
where the subway turns around.

166
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:50,093
Barney's legs won't work.

167
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:51,714
He's riding the subway
from end to end

168
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:53,883
because he physically
can't get off the train.

169
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:55,866
Best 50 bucks I ever spent.

170
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:57,325
Listen to me, Ted.

171
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,334
I'm going to lose you any second.
I'm on the fourth car of the six train

172
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,646
heading south from Pelham
Bay Park in the Bronx.

173
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:05,573
Meet me at the 86th Street station in,
like, half an hour?

174
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,694
All right. I'll be right there.

175
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,254
Stay where you are.

176
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:12,113
Ted, Ted.

177
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:33,483
Oh, come on. You're not even going
to give up your seat for him?

178
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:37,625
I'm sorry. I can't.

179
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,983
Douche.

180
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,640
- Barney?!
- Ted!

181
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,120
Hey!

182
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:06,899
No...!

183
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:10,788
See? If Barney never
tried to run the marathon,

184
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,530
you never would have
jumped that turnstile,

185
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:14,577
you wouldn't have had
that court date today,

186
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,290
and we would have
made this flight.

187
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:17,577
You're right.

188
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,438
Everything can be
traced back to him.

189
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,378
Like that rash we
all got at Christmas.

190
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:25,109
All right,
I have to see what's going on.

191
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:29,118
- So I was able to get you two seats.
- Really? That's great!

192
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:31,987
No, no, not you. I'm talking to
my mom about Blue Man Group.

193
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:33,398
Ma, can I call you back?

194
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:35,497
Okay, what about our flight?
Can we get on?

195
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,887
I'm still waiting for... Huh.

196
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,160
Looks like your
flight left already.

197
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:42,788
What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no.
I have to be in Chicago today.

198
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,319
Well, he never even
called you back?

199
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,919
Well, it's typical pilot.
They don't call you back at work

200
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:49,017
and they don't call you back after
you spend two nights with them

201
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,740
at a Radisson in Orlando.

202
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:57,869
It turned out there was one other
flight that would just barely get me

203
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,247
to Chicago on time
for my job interview,

204
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,847
but it was all the way on the
other side of the airport.

205
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:04,876
What was the name of
the airline again?

206
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,737
I think it was something
like Flights R' Us.

207
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:07,858
Was the "R" backwards?

208
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,199
God, I hope not.

209
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:12,628
- Geez.
- Stupid smart carts.

210
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,867
More like dumb carts.

211
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,276
If we miss this flight,
it's all Barney's fault.

212
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:20,807
You know, Barney never would have
run the marathon in the first place

213
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:23,117
- if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.
- Yeah, so?

214
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,299
What, you think
this is my fault?

215
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:30,777
For Marshall, the initial idea to run
the marathon came way back in April.

216
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,816
My pants are starting
to feel a little tight.

217
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:36,418
Oh, that's okay.
I love that cute little belly.

218
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:43,119
I cannot allow this.

219
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:44,316
What?

220
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:49,626
I am going to run the
New York City Marathon.

221
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:02,238
"It is important to load
up on carbohydrates

222
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:05,199
two to four hours
before a big run.

223
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:07,577
Try a breakfast of a bagel,
a banana,

224
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:10,547
oatmeal, strawberries
and some orange juice."

225
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:13,298
Here you go, Marshmallow.
Just like the book said.

226
00:11:13,316 --> 00:11:17,126
Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating
all of my breakfast runner-style.

227
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:19,056
Liquids are digested faster.

228
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,078
That way, no energy is wasted,

229
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:23,736
and it's all about the run.

230
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:57,878
"Don't forget to give yourself
plenty of positive reinforcement."

231
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:01,017
This is gonna be
your best run yet.

232
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:05,489
You're going to accomplish
all of your goals.

233
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,976
You are a robot sent
from the future

234
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,896
to win the marathon!

235
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:15,049
You are... Marshall.

236
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:18,836
You are... Marshall.

237
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:23,048
You are Marshall! Yeah!

238
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:32,299
"Chafing or blisters can
occur in a number of areas,

239
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:35,926
including the feet, armpits,
or even the nipples.

240
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:39,846
Try using some petroleum
jelly on the affected areas."

241
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,217
Oh, gosh!

242
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,629
Dude, you are a
terrific runner.

243
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:23,597
Tomorrow you're gonna run and
finish the New York City Marathon!

244
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:25,636
You're the best.

245
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:27,828
You look good.

246
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:31,786
Nobody does it better than you.

247
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:33,438
Marshall? Oh, my God!

248
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:37,066
So, yes, it was your fault.

249
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:39,346
I mean, if you don't show up at the
apartment in the middle of the day,

250
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,036
Marshall doesn't break his toe,
Barney doesn't run in his place,

251
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:43,907
I don't jump the turnstile
and get a court date,

252
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:46,166
and we make our flight
in plenty of time!

253
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:51,046
And I don't fall down and bite
my tongue at the airport.

254
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,837
That really wasn't my fault.

255
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:55,398
I wouldn't have walked in on
Marshall if it weren't for Lily.

256
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,808
Hey, think about it.

257
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:58,817
Hey, what's going on here?

258
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,867
Oh, looks like they're
camping out for something.

259
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:02,196
Yeah, but for what?

260
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,436
I don't know. Usually there's a
Stormtrooper or Klingon in line

261
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,169
to give you some indication.

262
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:08,996
"Annual wedding dress blowout.

263
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:12,169
Designer sample
dresses up to 90% off.

264
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:14,239
Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."

265
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:18,379
Oh, my God. Can you believe what some
nut bags will do to save a few bucks?

266
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:20,539
We have to camp out.

267
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,416
- Are you serious?
- You don't understand.

268
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:24,839
This is an amazing sale.
I've heard about it before,

269
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,837
but I never knew where it was.

270
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:30,446
We'll have a wedding dress campout.
It'll be fun.

271
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:32,716
I can't go.
I've got this thing.

272
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,907
- What thing?
- A penis.

273
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:38,816
- This is the place.
- Oh, wow.

274
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:41,908
Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet!

275
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,187
Vera Wang!

276
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:47,267
Oh, Robin, do you have any idea
what you guys stumbled onto here?

277
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:49,027
You said wang.

278
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:55,436
Oh, this reminds me of the ticket
line to Lilith Fair, 1998.

279
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:57,247
Only fewer mullets.

280
00:14:57,268 --> 00:15:02,038
You should feel good. You're only, like,
the tenth craziest bride in New York.

281
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,978
Ooh, this is comfy.

282
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:09,449
We might actually
be able to sleep.

283
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,549
That's kind of annoying.

284
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:16,817
Well, I'm sure somebody will be
out here to turn it off any minute.

285
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,459
I don't think I can take this.

286
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,916
Every time it turns off,
I think,

287
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:36,917
oh, maybe it won't
turn on again,

288
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:39,148
but then it does.

289
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:40,679
Why does it, Robin?

290
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:42,868
Why does it keep turning on?

291
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:44,916
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie. Why...

292
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:47,698
Why don't we make a
game out of it, okay?

293
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:49,266
Why don't we sing along?

294
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:11,998
If we get through this,

295
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:15,477
I swear I'm gonna live
my life differently.

296
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:19,786
I just want to tell my parents
I love them one more time.

297
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:23,089
Morning, ladies.

298
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:28,046
- It's him. It's the car guy!
- Get out of here!

299
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,688
The next morning, Robin was too tired
to go all the way back to Brooklyn,

300
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,017
so while I was at work,

301
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,599
she went to crash at my
apartment for a couple hours,

302
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,919
and that's when...

303
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,398
Nobody does it better than you.

304
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,057
Marshall?! Oh, my God!

305
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:55,616
So if Lily hadn't dragged me
down to the wedding dress store,

306
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:57,326
we would have made
the first flight.

307
00:16:57,388 --> 00:17:00,018
Oh, thank God.
The doors are still open. We made it.

308
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,126
Hi. Please.
We really need to get on this flight.

309
00:17:04,248 --> 00:17:06,198
Oh, my God!

310
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:08,626
You're that reporter
from Metro News 1.

311
00:17:08,646 --> 00:17:10,386
Yes, yes, I am.

312
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,367
I can't believe
you recognized me.

313
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:14,779
- You did that story on the giant pizzas?
- Would you check to see

314
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,109
- if you have any more seats?
- One moment, sir.

315
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,087
Were those pizzas real?
Come on, were they?

316
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:22,326
- Robin...
- One second, Ted.

317
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,409
Um, you know,
a lot of people ask me that.

318
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:26,738
The truth is,
the pizzas were real.

319
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:29,818
- Calzones. Trick photography.
- I knew it!

320
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:32,818
God, it is so nice
to meet a fan!

321
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:36,146
And I would be a fan of your
work if you could get us

322
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,846
two seats on that next flight.

323
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:42,706
Well, the, uh, flight attendants are
just finishing up their final
seat count.

324
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:44,649
Let me see what I can find out.

325
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:47,379
Would it help if I got on and gave an
impassioned speech about my destiny?

326
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,917
I think it might hurt.

327
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,339
This is such a nightmare.

328
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:58,468
Okay, so we agree? This goes
back to Lily wanting to camp out

329
00:17:58,556 --> 00:17:59,776
for a wedding dress?

330
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:01,578
No.

331
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:03,598
Wait. It goes back further.

332
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,546
Remember why we were eating
hot dogs on the East Side?

333
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:19,179
1939?!

334
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:22,238
This penny's from 1939!

335
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:27,029
A 67-year-old penny.

336
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,958
Do you realize this penny was
minted during World War II?

337
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:33,288
Oh, so was my grandfather,
but that doesn't make him interesting.

338
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,099
Look, I know a little
something about coins,

339
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,139
and this baby is worth
something to a collector.

340
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,288
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

341
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:42,586
You know what?
I'm gonna take you out to dinner

342
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:44,327
with the money I get
for this little guy.

343
00:18:44,347 --> 00:18:46,797
And that's exactly what I did.

344
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:50,418
You're lucky there's still a place that
serves anything for a dollar fifty.

345
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:53,487
Hey, that's 150 times
its original value.

346
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:57,038
Actually, the meal
was only $1.49.

347
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,559
1984.

348
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:02,368
Hey, in 50 years,
we can get dinner again.

349
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:03,927
How dare you.

350
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,838
Hey, what's going on?

351
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:07,527
I don't know. Looks like they're
camping out for something.

352
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,027
Yeah, but for what?

353
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:11,227
It was me.

354
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:13,158
I started this.

355
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:15,089
If I hadn't picked
up that penny,

356
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:17,967
we wouldn't have gone to get hot
dogs all the way across town.

357
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:20,427
And we wouldn't have seen
that wedding dress store,

358
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:22,388
Lily wouldn't have wanted
to camp out there,

359
00:19:22,407 --> 00:19:25,607
and I wouldn't have needed a nap
at your apartment the next day.

360
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:27,866
Marshall wouldn't
have broken his toe.

361
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:30,026
Barney wouldn't have
run the marathon.

362
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:32,048
I wouldn't have jumped
that turnstile,

363
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,567
gotten arrested,
had that court date...

364
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:36,648
And we would have
made our flight.

365
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:39,327
I don't think we can go
back any further than that

366
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:41,079
unless you know who
dropped the penny.

367
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,507
I wish I did.

368
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,409
Though that person's already
been punished enough,

369
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:47,106
losing a sweet penny like that.

370
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,986
Uh, sir?

371
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:51,697
Oh, please tell me you
have some good news.

372
00:19:51,717 --> 00:19:53,507
Uh, I'm afraid not.

373
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,576
There are no extra
seats on the plane.

374
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:56,876
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:58,749
All, right, well,
thanks for trying.

376
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,769
I can't believe this.

377
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:03,557
That's it, it's over.

378
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:05,076
Ted, come on.

379
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:08,466
Your destiny just wasn't to
make it to Chicago today.

380
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:11,419
Anyway, if that firm really wants you,
they'll reschedule.

381
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,286
But that's not what happened.

382
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:15,097
They didn't reschedule.

383
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:16,976
They hired someone else.

384
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:19,529
And as it turned out,
three months later,

385
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:22,816
that guy ended up having
to relocate to Chicago.

386
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:25,208
Kids, funny thing
about destiny--

387
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:27,687
I thought I was destined
to get that job.

388
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:29,016
But I was wrong.

389
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:31,597
My destiny was to
stay in New York.

390
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:33,858
Because if I hadn't,

391
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:36,019
I never would have
met your mother.
