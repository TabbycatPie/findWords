(MIKE READING)

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,922
You're good with me working
on the takeover with Logan?

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,328
As long as we don't let
that affect this...

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,967
We won't.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,605
I do always get what I want.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,361
And what I wanna do with this company
is strip it down, flip it over...

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,280
- That's enough. We're done.
- You're right. We are.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,882
When I told you that our relationship is
now purely professional, I was serious.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,088
What's not purely
professional about lunch?

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,368
Unless you mean the sex
that will be following lunch?

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,006
Phillip. Your son. You lost him.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,007
And that's what this company
is to you now. Your family.

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,521
I lost both of my parents
when I was 11 years old.

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
So, I know a little something
about needing family.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,123
Since when does the SEC

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,891
go around intimidating
law firms by going after their clients?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,924
They don't, but they will when Eric
Woodall starts there next week.

(SIGHS)

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,722
- MIKE: Another all-nighter?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,048
- Work or school?
- Work.

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,524
- What were you working on?
- You know what I was working on.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,723
I'm so sorry, but I'm so tired
I have to go get some sleep...

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,450
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- ...before I go back to the office.

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,005
Hey, I haven't seen
you in two days.

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,202
- Give me five minutes.
- Okay.

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,290
But I can't be responsible
for anything that I say.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,686
Wow. Okay.

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,167
In that case, is Logan going
after another board member?

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,964
- Nice try.
- Mmm.

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,447
- Is he running out of cash?
- I can't tell you that.

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,005
Did you love him?

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,007
How long have you been
waiting to ask me that?

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,407
You know, just when you were
at your weakest and most vulnerable.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,686
I did love him.
But I don't love him now.

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,167
- I love you.
- Mmm.

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,326
Who ended it?

38
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,885
- Does that matter?
- It does to me.

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,886
I ended it.

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,008
Now, do you have any other burning
questions, or can I go to sleep, please?

41
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,849
Um, let me see.

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,167
What's the most expensive
thing you ever shoplifted?

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,850
Were you a mean girl?

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,526
Are you interested in taking
a pole dancing class?

45
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,643
You know what?
We'll get into that later.

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,080
Sweet dreams.

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,881
God, enough about you.
I want to talk about me.

48
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,686
- We were just talking about you.
- Not enough.

49
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,004
All right, fine. Let's talk about Harvey.

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,964
So, guess what he's been up to.

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,246
What?

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,603
He found the master tapes
for his father's solo album.

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,571
He's working on buying them.

54
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,605
He's been trying to find them
ever since he lost his father.

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,047
Oh, I see why you're telling me this.

56
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,447
You're trying to humanize Harvey
because you're afraid

57
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,006
of what this fight
is going to do to us.

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,441
I'm afraid because of what
it's already doing to you.

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,290
I'm talking Ali-Frazier.

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,368
- Come on, Donna.
- Listen to me.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,490
They started out like brothers,

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,250
then they went
toe to toe three times

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,563
and Joe Frazier went to his grave
hating Muhammad Ali.

64
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,647
- I didn't know you were a boxing fan.
- I'm a Harvey fan.

65
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,440
So am I.

66
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,924
And that's why I'm giving him my best.

67
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,004
- Thanks for the coffee. (KISSES)
- You're welcome.

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,045
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,327
- You're in late.
- I was up late.

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,851
Working on my stuff?

71
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,927
Working on a lot of stuff.
What can I help you with?

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,851
- I wanted to talk to you.
- About?

73
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,247
Well, when I told you before

74
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,489
that I'm not the same guy
that I used to be, what I meant was

75
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,409
I got caught up in
emotion back then.

76
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,763
I'm not caught up
in emotion anymore.

77
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,287
And?

78
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,325
And that means that I'm going to have
to do some calculated things,

79
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,126
and I needed to know
that you're okay with that.

80
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,850
Why wouldn't I be?

81
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,601
You know why.

82
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,291
Logan, you don't have to come and
have these little check in talks with me.

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,404
I am a big girl,
and I know how these things work.

84
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,809
So, just do what you have to do
and stop worrying about me.

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,166
Great.

86
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,649
Harvey, what the hell's going on?

87
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,809
At the moment, I'm 18 minutes away

88
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,082
from owning Steve McQueen's
Shelby Cobra.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,445
You know what I'm talking about.

90
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,040
Last time I saw you, you told me
you were going to get me this company.

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,561
I just found out
Walter Gillie funded his pension.

92
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,809
- Did you think they wouldn't fight back?
- I expected them to fight.

93
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,570
Right now, we're getting our ass kicked.

94
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,409
Well, what scorecard
are you looking at?

95
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,525
Because we just got them to give up half
their war chest just to stay in the fight.

96
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,130
I don't give a shit
what the scorecard says.

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,368
- I want a knockout.
- Well, it doesn't work that way.

98
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,606
It can if you hit them below the belt.

99
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,846
- Logan.
- Save it.

100
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,249
When my father
went up against Carl Icahn,

101
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,885
he said that you waited
till he wasn't looking,

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,446
you walked up behind him,
and you shot him in the back.

103
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,881
Walter Gillie isn't Carl Icahn.

104
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,008
I'm not talking about Walter Gillie.
I'm talking about Mike Ross.

105
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,326
I don't care who you're talking about.

106
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,881
That Icahn deal
was completely different.

107
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,680
The only difference I see is that this deal
is against your surrogate son.

108
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,170
So. Are you willing
to do this or not?

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,243
You want below the belt?
I'll give you below the belt.

110
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,850
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

111
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,204
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

112
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,642
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

113
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,009
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

114
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,483
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

115
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,610
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

116
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,724
All right!

117
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,129
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

118
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,084
The greenback boogie

119
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,244
Louis, we talked about this.

120
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,924
It's just so weird to see him
in my old office. You know?

121
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,321
It's like when you drive by the house you
grew up in and there's another family

122
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,727
in there and all you want to do is
break in and make yourself soup.

123
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,081
- You know that feeling?
- Well, it depends on the soup.

124
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,089
- Pfft. Mushroom barley.
- Then no.

125
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,046
Hey, did you get him that apology gift
I told you to get him?

126
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,891
Except instead of scotch, I got us
two front row tickets to the ballet.

127
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,646
Oh.

128
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,325
Well, it's the thought that counts.

129
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,641
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

130
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,849
Louis. Can I help
you with something?

131
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,882
Yes.

132
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,324
You and me, we, uh,
got off on the wrong foot.

133
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,403
Words were said.
Hurtful caricatures were drawn.

134
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,610
And I did some bad things, too.

135
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,850
- Water under the bridge, Louis.
- Well, no. Not to me.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,085
See, um, I once was told
that actions have consequences.

137
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,807
And I want to turn things
around by inviting you

138
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,484
to the American Ballet Company's
production of Giselle.

139
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,206
- The ballet?
- Yeah. You and me, tonight.

140
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,891
Well, Louis, I would love
to go to the ballet with you,

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,482
I really would,
but I have Knicks tickets tonight, man.

142
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,886
And I... I never miss a game.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,889
All right. I'm going to let it go
that you're choosing basketball

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,887
over, uh, Giselle.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,651
But I really need to make this up to you,
Jeff. I, I can't be in the red.

146
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,603
I am always, always in the black.

147
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,642
And I don't mean
that in a racial sense.

148
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,570
Well, now that you mention it,
I could really use some advice.

149
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,331
- About the case?
- About Jessica.

150
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,408
I just pulled Adam Grieves
as opposing counsel.

151
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,523
And long story short,
he hates me.

152
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,803
And I could really use Jessica's help
to run some interference. But...

153
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,289
I'm the new guy, it's only my second
case, and I don't know what to do.

154
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,644
Well, I tell you what I'm going to do.

155
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,923
I'm going to get you front row tickets
to Jessica Pearson's help.

156
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,171
Okay, Harvey.
You didn't bring me here

157
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,805
to make me choke
down these Brussels sprouts.

158
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,921
No, I didn't.

159
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,771
But you are going to have
to choke down something else.

160
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,488
Let me guess.
This is about Walter Gillie.

161
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,601
No, it's not about Walter.

162
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,371
It's about the line of credit
that you're about to stop giving him.

163
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,484
- And why on earth would I do that?
- Because if you don't,

164
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,410
I have a feeling that every
Pearson Specter client

165
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,522
that you currently do business with

166
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,802
is suddenly going to move
their accounts to Chase.

167
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,809
You really want to cripple
his company that badly?

168
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,766
His company's already dead.
He just doesn't know it yet.

169
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,121
That doesn't give you
the right to threaten me.

170
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,720
If I were threatening you,
I'd come right out and say it.

171
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,968
If you don't do this tomorrow morning,

172
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,924
you lose two billion dollars'
worth of deposits.

173
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,486
- You son of a bitch.
- MIKE: That he is.

174
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,444
What are you doing here, Mike?

175
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,286
What do you mean? I just came
for the Brussels sprouts.

176
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,084
You know howl know
how good they are?

177
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,241
How?

178
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,964
Because this is where
Harvey brings bankers

179
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,764
to strong-arm them
into doing some bullshit.

180
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,769
- Don't listen to him.
- MIKE: No, he should listen to me.

181
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,531
I'm Walter Gillie' partner.
And if he cuts off our funding

182
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,847
at any point in the next two months
following this lunch,

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,924
then the next time you're talking
about these Brussels sprouts

184
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,929
will be in front of a grand jury.

185
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,810
Oh. And, Vernon,
don't take it personally.

186
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,445
He did the same thing to the guy
from Leeds

187
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,847
at the exact same table
seven months ago.

188
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,603
Louis. I got your memo.

189
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,522
And if you want to get an antique
diving bell for your new office,

190
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,727
it's on your dime.

191
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,848
Okay, that's bullshit, but whatever.

192
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,725
- Um, I'm here about Jeff Malone.
- I'm not the principal.

193
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,286
You two are going to have to work
your shit out on the playground.

194
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,926
But you see, that's just it.
We already did.

195
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,249
Something's not right.
Why are you here?

196
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,488
I'm here because
you need to run interference.

197
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,449
I thought you just said
you worked it out.

198
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,006
No, not with me.
With Adam Grieves at the SEC.

199
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,121
He has it in for Malone.

200
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,802
Louis, I'm glad you two are going to be
walking to school together from now on.

201
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,688
But I hired Jeff Malone
to handle the SEC

202
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,643
not to get me to handle
them for him.

203
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,208
You know, you're always telling me
not to make enemies.

204
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,928
And for the first time since Harvey,
I have just made a new friend.

205
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,922
So, I'm asking you.

206
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,725
Please do it for my friend.

207
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,927
Louis.

208
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,691
If you won't do it for him,
please do it for me.

209
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,240
I just had a very interesting
chat with Louis Litt.

210
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,408
Louis is a very interesting guy.

211
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,170
Did you know he's never
eaten an olive?

212
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,327
I did not.

213
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,965
But I do know you fed him some bullshit.

214
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,491
- That doesn't sound like me.
- Really?

215
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,523
Because he thinks we need
to work together

216
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,404
because there's bad blood
between you and Adam Grieves.

217
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,204
- I don't like to talk about it.
- Of course not.

218
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,728
Because you and Adam Grieves
play basketball every Wednesday.

219
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,047
What happens on the court,
Jessica, stays on the court.

220
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,487
I thought I was clear
about boundaries.

221
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,245
Well, listen. If that's really how you feel,

222
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,408
why don't you just tell Louis
that you want to bow out

223
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,841
because you don't trust
yourself around me?

224
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,604
Yeah, I didn't think so.
See you tomorrow.

225
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,849
What happened to going
below the belt?

226
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,847
I went below the belt.

227
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,201
The referee stepped in and
threw a grand jury in my face.

228
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,607
Well, I wasn't asking you to go
below the belt with the company.

229
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,848
I was asking you to go below
the belt with Ross.

230
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,882
What are you talking about?

231
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,766
I'm saying you hire a private investigator
to find every skeleton in his closet,

232
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,962
he wakes up in the morning
and it's all over the front page.

233
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,050
Logan, that's not going
below the belt, that's just nuts.

234
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,362
You're full of shit.
You don't want to do this

235
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,528
because you don't have the stomach
to do it to your boy.

236
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,723
No. I don't want to do it because
we're on a path to win this thing.

237
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,803
And I let you bait me
into doing what I already did

238
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,406
because I thought
you were just a little impatient.

239
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,008
But now, I'm starting to
realize what it really is.

240
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,322
What is that?

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,002
Who's full of shit now?
(SIGHS)

242
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,006
- This has nothing to do with Rachel.
- You got there pretty damn fast.

243
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,084
Hey. I asked you to put Mike Ross down
with one punch.

244
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,202
You said you would and you didn't.

245
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,004
So, either do what I'm asking
or I'll do it myself.

246
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,487
- You can't do it, Harvey.
- Yes, I can.

247
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,566
Logan's going to do it anyway.
At least this way, it will be me.

248
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,522
What's the difference

249
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,325
if you hire somebody to look into Mike
or Logan does?

250
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,647
You know damn well
they're going to uncover his secret.

251
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,206
- I don't know that and you don't, either.
- Yeah, I do.

252
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,089
No one's ever found it before.

253
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,249
Because you were hiding it from people
who weren't looking for it,

254
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,441
not from people who are.

255
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,289
What do you want from me, Donna?

256
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,923
I want you to get Mike to give up.

257
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,167
Well, I'm not going to do that

258
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,884
because I know he's
not going to give up.

259
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,764
- How do you know that?
- Because I know.

260
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,965
This is Mike we're talking about.

261
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,641
And if it were anyone other than Mike, I'd
have an article in the Journal tomorrow.

262
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,289
- That's not what you told Logan.
- Because I goddamn lied to Logan.

263
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,483
And it didn't work.
Now, I'm going to do what I have to do.

264
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,161
Well, the least you can do is warn him.

265
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,691
He's on the other side.

266
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,610
I'm not going to warn him.
That's not how it works.

267
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,049
Well, maybe you should
think of something

268
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,400
that won't ruin his goddamn life.

269
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,528
Hey. You ready to get
down to business?

270
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,005
- Yes, I am.
- Good.

271
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,487
I was thinking that maybe
we could do all this over lunch.

272
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,931
It's 10:30.

273
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,044
- There's a lot to discuss, Jessica.
- No, there isn't.

274
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,489
We need to bury them in paperwork.

275
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,761
No, we don't. We just need to come up

276
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,803
with a legitimate reason
why Brooks made that trade.

277
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,081
There is no legitimate reason.

278
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,851
I didn't say there needs to be one,
Jessica. I said we need to find one.

279
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,806
You are taking to defense
like a fish to water.

280
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,362
Well, you didn't bring me in here just for
my genetically superior bone structure.

281
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,720
- Did you?
- Mmm. No.

282
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,006
That's what I brought him in for.

283
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,771
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I was just getting up to speed.

284
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,281
You brought Louis in.

285
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,841
Of course. Three heads are
better than two.

286
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,530
Unless you have an objection.

287
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,691
(CLEARS THROAT) No.
Are you kidding me?

288
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,724
I would never turn down
a threesome. Right, buddy?

289
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,968
- I hear ya.
- Good.

290
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,721
Because Jessica and I were just having
a little difference of opinion

291
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,841
about what to do next.

292
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,611
Yes. And I'm sure Louis,
the man that I hired,

293
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,644
the man who owes
his very career to me,

294
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,966
will see things my way.

295
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,724
I don't want to step
on anyone's toes.

296
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,491
No, Louis, you're not stepping
on anyone's toes here.

297
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,961
And to be fair, I think
you're an amazing attorney

298
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,801
who doesn't owe anyone anything.
Ooh. Do you work out?

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,606
(LAUGHING)
I, I try to stay fit.

300
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,010
Try? Mission accomplished.
(LAUGHING)

301
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,169
Can we get to the point?
Lou... Louis,

302
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,931
Jeff and I have two different approaches
to this case.

303
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,850
Exactly. Go for the knockout
punch or bore them to death.

304
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,201
Well, when you frame it that way...

305
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,288
I can't believe you're using
that old debate team trick.

306
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,841
Farm boy strong,
that's what you are.

307
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,930
Jessica, what debate team trick?

308
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,008
Calling my approach
"bore them to death"

309
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,531
and yours a "knockout punch."

310
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,405
Man, you're really good at this.
Have you done this before?

311
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,442
Sure have.

312
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,928
Look, Jessica,
you can make assumptions

313
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,209
about how this farm boy's going
to come down on this all you want to,

314
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,722
but I think we all pretty much
know he's playing on my team.

315
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,811
Jeff, you're right.
You are right.

316
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,130
And in fact, I think that because you
and Louis see eye to eye on this case,

317
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,926
that you should work together
and I should bow out.

318
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,929
You actually think that bothers me?

319
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,767
Because now, I've got this
farm boy all to myself, Jess.

320
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,846
Just you and me, cowboy.
Just like Ernie and Bert.

321
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,241
- LOUIS: Jeff Malone is in love with me.
- What?

322
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,284
I was just in a meeting with him, and
he started off by patting my shoulder.

323
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,722
He's a jock, Louis.
That's just how they are.

324
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,604
No. He was then rubbing my shoulders.

325
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,166
Then, he touched my arm.
He's all over me.

326
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,601
- Wow. What was the meeting about?
- It doesn't matter. Donna,

327
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,724
his arguments are loaded
with double meaning.

328
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,008
Who invokes the penal code
in an SEC case?

329
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,765
He said "penal"?

330
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,769
Three times. The third time,
we were just talking about

331
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,201
the Glass-Steagall Act,
which is purely civil. And it's...

332
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,606
God damn it, woman.
Do I have to draw you a map?

333
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,247
I mean, come to think of it,
athletes coming out is all the rage now.

334
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,528
And guess what his
favorite sport is. Basket

335
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,524
- ball.
- Oh, my God.

336
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,807
- Shut the front door.
- No, I want to shut the back door.

337
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,365
Okay, Louis.

338
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,290
Now that we've finnly
established his gayness,

339
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,129
why would he think you're gay?

340
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,083
I mean, you're...
(MAKES EXPLODING SOUND)

341
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,362
(HITS DESK)
...straight as an arrow.

342
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,011
I may have said that I eat cock
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

343
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,326
What?

344
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,726
It was a different kind of cock, Donna.

345
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,211
- It wasn't.
- Okay. Louis.

346
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,246
What exactly do you
want from me?

347
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,811
I want you to tell me
what I should do about it.

348
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,491
I'm going to tell you exactly
what you're going to do about it.

349
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,768
- Nothing.
- What do you mean nothing?

350
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,042
I mean don't give him anything back.
He'll get the message.

351
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,969
It'll pass.
(CHUCKLES)

352
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,881
Donna, I don't think you understand
the power of my sexuality.

353
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,881
What are you doing?

354
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,571
Oh, you know. It's just
a little something for your file.

355
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,170
I have a file?

356
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,801
- That information's classified.
- Wait. Why?

357
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,366
- It's in your file.
- Oh, shit.

358
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,447
There's a secret, it will be
thrown under the table

359
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,005
Harvey Specter.

360
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,806
If you'd be more comfortable,

361
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,968
I have a couple rocks
you could crawl out from under.

362
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,124
Most people would go with some
tall weeds I could hide behind.

363
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,527
Most people don't take
these fights personally. I do.

364
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,689
- That's exactly why I'm here.
- Meaning?

365
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,041
I came here to tell you
something man to man

366
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,844
because I know what
this company means to you.

367
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,170
If you knew what this company meant
to me, you wouldn't be trying to steal it.

368
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,408
Walter, I know how your son died.

369
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,929
Get the hell out of my office.

370
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,040
Not before I tell you that
Mike Ross was a drug dealer.

371
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,282
Bullshit he was.
And I'm calling security,

372
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,402
and if you're not gone
by the time they get here,

373
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,761
theirjob's going to be
getting me off you.

374
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,647
Fine, I'll go. But ask him.
Ask him if he ever dealt drugs.

375
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,730
Ask him if he ever refused
to take a drug test.

376
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,161
Ask him if he was ever
high at work.

377
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,850
I said get out.

378
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,850
And ask him if on the very day he came
to me looking for a job,

379
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,281
he had a briefcase filled
with marijuana.

380
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,883
This is how you do this?

381
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,488
Come here "man to man"

382
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,685
and use my son's death
to take my company from me?

383
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,930
Well, you are nothing
but a piece of shit.

384
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,923
You're right. I am a piece of shit.

385
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,523
But that doesn't make what I'm
telling you any less true.

386
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,764
Walter. What are you doing here?

387
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,564
I'm having second thoughts.

388
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,887
- About the takeover.
- About you.

389
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,121
I'm sorry. I don't understand...

390
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,045
Have you ever been involved
in a drug deal?

391
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,566
(SCOFFS)

392
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,528
Walter, look,
I'm trying save your company here.

393
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,847
And I'm here to find out what kind
of man I'm in business with.

394
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,923
So, I'm going to ask you again.

395
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,088
Have you ever been
involved in a drug deal?

396
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,208
What did Harvey tell you?

397
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,044
Looks like he told me the truth.

398
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,891
The truth is that Harvey can't beat us,
so he's trying to divide us.

399
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,365
And he's using your son to do it.

400
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,727
Just like you used his memory
to make you my partner.

401
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,930
- To save your life's work.
- Another lie from another liar.

402
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,881
You two deserve each other.
We're done.

403
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,121
- Mike, are you okay?
- I don't care who you find.

404
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,287
I want you to hire someone

405
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,641
and get every piece of dirt
there is on Logan Sanders.

406
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,046
- Uh, okay.
- Just do it.

407
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,050
- Where are you going?
- To take care of something else.

408
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,440
Couple of things.

409
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,444
It's Porter's birthday. I got him that weird
zucchini cake he likes from the Bronx.

410
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,365
- What cake?
- Somebody returned Stuntman's chair.

411
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,328
It was missing?

412
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,290
And the "no questions asked"
memo in the kitchen worked.

413
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,761
- What did it stop?
- Ooh. It's not important.

414
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,123
- None of these things are important.
- Oh, and one more thing.

415
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,887
Louis thinks Malone is in love with him.
Your secret's safe.

416
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,005
And you're welcome.

417
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,641
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Hey, Louis.

418
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,524
- Do you have a minute?
- Ah, it's about all I have.

419
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,529
- Because I'm, uh, super, super busy.
- Yeah, well, listen.

420
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,211
I just wanted to check in and see
if you're ready to pull an all-nighter.

421
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,688
I just got all the brokerage tapes in, and
I figured we could just grind it out.

422
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,370
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

423
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,091
Unless you want to go right now,
and just pound it out all at once.

424
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,646
Okay, that's it.
I mean, you have got this all wrong.

425
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,607
Jeff, I like you. As a friend.

426
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,600
Right, Louis. I like you, too.
I think I've made that perfectly clear.

427
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,564
Too clear, man. Too clear.

428
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,245
I mean, enough with
the come-ens already.

429
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,964
- What?
- Yeah. I mean, I... I get it.

430
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,645
You know, we're a perfect match.

431
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,489
You know, if you go that way.
Ebony and ivory.

432
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,807
But I play a different instrument. So...

433
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,844
Oh. Louis. No...

434
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,684
- Look. (STAMMERING)
- It's just...

435
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,168
I just don't want there to be,
you know, just awkwardness.

436
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,568
Especially since Jessica just bowed out
and it's just me and you now.

437
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,847
Right.

438
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,441
(SIGHS)

439
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,931
Well, now that you've seen right
through me, Louis, I...

440
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,689
lam disappointed.

441
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,046
Are you going to be okay?

442
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,606
To be honest, I'm feeling
a little raw right now.

443
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,846
Oh, shit.

444
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,690
(SIGHS) I'm sorry-

445
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,328
Maybe it's best if you just told Jessica
that she needs to step back in.

446
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,646
- Yes.
- Yeah.

447
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,689
Can do. (LAUGHING) Yeah.

448
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,211
- Get up.
- You here to fight me?

449
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,810
Oh, should I wait for you
to turn your back?

450
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,001
That seems to be more your speed.

451
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,168
I'm sorry. Were you expecting me
to give you a call?

452
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,362
No, I was expecting you
to be a human being.

453
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,847
From where I'm sitting,
I was a goddamn saint.

454
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,086
Oh, yeah? How's that?

455
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,851
If I didn't do what I did, Logan was going
to hire a private investigator

456
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,770
- to smear you up and down the block.
- So, what?

457
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,645
You know what.
I shot you in the knees,

458
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,206
so he wouldn't shoot you
in the face. You're welcome.

459
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,283
You know what, Harvey? I'm going
to take a pass on the "thank you"

460
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,846
and instead skip right to the part
where I call you a piece of shit.

461
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,486
You know what? I'm getting
a little tired of hearing that.

462
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,568
And what does that make you
for threatening to bring

463
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,966
criminal charges in that restaurant?

464
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,010
You deserved criminal charges for
what you were doing in that restaurant.

465
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,851
You didn't have a problem
when we did it seven months ago

466
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,887
to the guy from Leeds.

467
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,128
Seven months ago, you weren't
lying to somebody about me.

468
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,642
I didn't lie. And seven months ago,
you were goddamn here.

469
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,567
So, that's what this is about.

470
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,362
You can't stand that I got out of here
and that I'm succeeding without you.

471
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,729
Without me?

472
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,288
I made you.
Without me, you're nothing.

473
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,851
Right there.

474
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,807
That's who you are, and that's why I left.

475
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,763
Bullshit.
Don't lay that on me.

476
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,645
You left because you needed
to feed that huge ego.

477
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,331
E90? Ego?

478
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,647
If I stayed here, you know what would
have been hanging over my head

479
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,285
for the rest of my life.

480
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,643
Which is why I told you to move
somewhere nobody ever knew you.

481
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,046
But you stayed here.

482
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,006
So, that thing is still over
your goddamn head, and I stopped it!

483
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,441
I don't care what you think you stopped.

484
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,724
You're going to go to Walter Gillie and
you're gonna make this thing right.

485
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,925
- It is right. It's over. You lost.
- Nothing's over.

486
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,849
And you're the one
who lost something today.

487
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,281
What are you talking about?

488
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,607
You went personal,
I went personal.

489
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,482
Your father's master tapes?
I've got 'em.

490
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,323
Those tapes have nothing to do
with this deal.

491
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,525
They do now.

492
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,645
Harvey.

493
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,489
- I did this.
- What?

494
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,690
The tapes. Mike found out
about 'em from me.

495
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,161
I've been meeting him for coffee,

496
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,123
just because I wanted
to make sure that everything

497
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,446
was okay between the two of you.

498
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,882
And I never, ever thought
he would do something like this.

499
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,846
- I am so, so sorry.
- It's not your fault, Donna.

500
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,048
- What are you going to do?
- Nothing.

501
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,924
The tapes have nothing
to with this deal.

502
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,481
The second I believe
they do, I'm done.

503
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,083
Ugh. Perfect timing.
Do you want me to get rid of him?

504
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,844
I'll handle it.

505
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,082
What part of "drag Mike Ross through
the mud" did you not understand?

506
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,682
The part where you come off looking
like a rich, vindictive douchebag.

507
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,767
That's not your call to make.

508
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,004
Based on your years
of experience in takeovers?

509
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,407
Here's something they didn't teach you
in snowboarding school,

510
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,569
or wherever the hell you went
before you decided to be a grownup.

511
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,324
Never destroy anyone in public

512
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,046
when you can accomplish
the same result in private.

513
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,601
Meaning?

514
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,041
I severed Mike's ties with
Walter Gillie. It's over.

515
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,009
You know, you told me
that Mike Ross wasn't a threat,

516
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,724
and then he handcuffed
us with a TRO.

517
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,367
You said that you'd take him down
with one blow, and then he got back up.

518
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,882
So, here's something that I did learn
in snowboarding school.

519
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,606
When someone talks shit,
I demand proof.

520
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,081
Proof of what?
Logan, we won.

521
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,281
You don't need to...

522
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,086
Need to what, come off like
a rich, vindictive douchebag?

523
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,042
I want proof that he's giving up his bid.

524
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,925
And if I don't get it by the morning,
I'm going to call my private investigators

525
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,088
and I'm going to finish what I started.

526
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,167
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think I'm going?

527
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,248
To get Mike to sign an
agreement to give up his bid.

528
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,562
- You can't.
- Why not?

529
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,650
Because you were right.
He's never gonna listen to you.

530
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,882
Donna, I know you're feeling
bad about the tapes, but...

531
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,526
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Then what are you saying?

532
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,569
I feel guilty that I told him.

533
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,963
But what he did, that's on you.

534
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,409
And the reason
he's not going to listen to you

535
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,000
- is because you acted like an asshole.
- Excuse me?

536
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,647
He came in here wanting an explanation
for why you did what you did,

537
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,282
- and you threw gas on the fire.
- I gave him an explanation.

538
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,167
Yeah, you told him he was nothing.

539
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,566
You know what?

540
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,967
About a half an hour ago,
you told me this was all your fault.

541
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,811
A half an hour ago,
I was thinking about what I did.

542
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,809
I wasn't thinking
about what you said to him.

543
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,969
It doesn't matter what I said to him.
leaved him.

544
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,441
Harvey.

545
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,206
You said before if it had been
anybody other than Mike,

546
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,210
you would have done what Logan
wanted without blinking an eye.

547
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,405
Well, if anybody other than Mike
had walked in here the way he did,

548
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,841
you would have shown him
the tiniest bit of compassion.

549
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,968
He bought those tapes
before he ever walked in here.

550
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,368
Those tapes were not the first
thing that he told you about.

551
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,921
But you made damn sure
they were the last.

552
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,088
So, you just flagged me
down to call me an asshole?

553
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,409
No, I flagged you down to tell you
that he's not going to listen to you.

554
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,807
But he might listen
to somebody else.

555
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,846
Just heard from Louis.
He has the stomach flu.

556
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,928
So, I'm going to have
to step in tonight.

557
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,883
Oh. That's too bad.

558
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,566
This wouldn't have anything to do

559
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,808
with him thinking
you're in love with him, would it?

560
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,968
No idea.
Feel like sushi?

561
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,441
Jeff, you can play
all the games that you want,

562
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,645
but an all-night review of the evidence
is a waste of my time.

563
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,762
So, why don't you get
a couple of associates

564
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,445
and I will see you in the morning?

565
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,320
Listen.

566
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,000
If you don't want to be here, that's fine.

567
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,565
But I am going to do this by myself

568
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,722
because I don't have
associates do my work.

569
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,927
And why is that?

570
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,120
Do you really want to know why?

571
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,760
Dalton Foster was a con man who
somehow convinced tenninally ill people

572
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,771
to sign over their insurance policies.
Anyway, it was my first big case.

573
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,360
So, I decided that I would get some help

574
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,324
going through the evidence,
just like this.

575
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,161
The help screwed up.
Dalton Foster walked.

576
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,650
Six months later,
he pulled the exact same scam.

577
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,569
Only this time, the problem

578
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,923
was one of his dying clients
had a miraculous recovery.

579
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,246
So, one day, Dalton came up
from behind her

580
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,045
and he beat her to death
with an aluminum bat.

581
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,806
So, am I glad you're here, Jessica?
Yes.

582
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,526
Did I take advantage of Louis?
Absolutely.

583
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,320
I may play games to get us together,
but I never play games with a case.

584
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,610
Never.

585
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,490
You have a minute?

586
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,282
- This must be serious.
- Why is that?

587
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,243
Because you usually just
tell me what to do.

588
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,284
Remember when you said if I want you
to deliver a message to Mike,

589
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,845
I should come to you directly?

590
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,290
You want me to get him to give up.

591
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,768
If Mike doesn't give up tonight,
Logan is going to hire someone

592
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,769
to dig up everything
they can on him.

593
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,807
That's why you went to Gillie.
You had no choice.

594
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,804
That's not the way Mike saw it.

595
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,806
You know, you could have come
to me before you did that.

596
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,045
I'm coming to you now.

597
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,491
HOW do I bill it?

598
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,763
The same way we bill everything.
Say it took twice as long as it did.

599
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,804
Okay, I take it back. My strategy?
My strategy isn't knockout punch.

600
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,843
We should have called it
"needle in a haystack."

601
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,287
- Getting frustrated?
- This guy?

602
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,443
This guy does not shut up.

603
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,411
I now know about his bronchitis,
his problems with his dry cleaner,

604
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,366
but absolutely no explanation
whatsoever about why he cashed out.

605
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,649
Oh, you mean besides being tipped that
he invested in a giant Ponzi scheme.

606
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,406
- Wait.
- What?

607
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,883
It's a call with an analyst predicting
a downturn in small cap stocks

608
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,883
in the next quarter.

609
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,371
Listen.

610
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,241
The Ponzi fund was made up
of small cap stocks.

611
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,370
It's a legit reason for him
to have cashed out.

612
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,321
Exactly what we need
to get the charges dropped.

613
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,850
And exactly the kind of call a junior
attorney might have missed.

614
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,641
So, do you see why we needed
to do this together?

615
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,569
Yes, I see.

616
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,246
What is it?

617
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,041
(SIGHS)

618
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,528
I have responsibilities
that you just don't want to understand.

619
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,568
(SIGHING) No, I don't.

620
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:19,203
I am the only woman partner
at this level in the city.

621
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,806
If word got out that I hired a partner
that I was in a relationship with...

622
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,084
- What? You'd be disbarred?
- You think this is a joke.

623
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,451
I think you're making excuses
for keeping me out of your life, Jessica.

624
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,800
And I'm calling you on it.

625
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,888
Oh, what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

626
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,805
It means that I'm making you
a promise, all right?

627
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,008
That no one,
no one will ever find out about us.

628
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,690
So, if that's what you're really afraid of,
if that's what's truly holding you back,

629
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,763
then it is off the table.

630
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,405
I'm sorry.

631
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,926
(DOOR OPENING)

632
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,921
Hey.

633
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,004
So, I know we said we're not supposed
to talk about the deal...

634
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,849
Why did you lie to me?

635
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,730
What are you talking about?

636
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,046
When I asked you about you and Logan,
you said that you ended it.

637
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,691
According to this,
you swore it was him.

638
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,881
This is my deposition
from his divorce.

639
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,489
You read this?
Why... Why would...

640
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,523
He looked into me,
I looked into him.

641
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,291
This is looking into me.

642
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,243
You still haven't
answered the question.

643
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,850
Mike, I told you the truth.

644
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,367
Logan was trying to patch things up
with his wife.

645
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,165
And he asked me to...
To back his story. So, I did.

646
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,281
You lied for him.

647
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,169
You loved him that much.

648
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,563
- I told you that I loved him.
- Yeah, but you didn't tell me that.

649
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,609
And I have been sitting here all night
wondering why you wouldn't...

650
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,968
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

651
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,843
I'm going to tell you now.

652
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,609
We had an affair.

653
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,650
We fell in love.

654
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,043
And he wanted to marry me,
and I said no.

655
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,731
And then, three months later,
he had a change of heart

656
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,846
and he wanted to get back with his wife
during his divorce proceedings.

657
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,361
So, he asked me
to help him and I did.

658
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,608
But when he wanted to marry me,

659
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,010
I said no because he wasn't the man
I want to spend my life with.

660
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,486
You are.

661
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,725
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

662
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,760
- Surprise. What?
- (WHISPERING) You have to go.

663
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,291
- What? What are you talking about?
- She's here.

664
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,370
Logan. ls there somebody
at the door?

665
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,886
Just"

666
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,646
I um“-

667
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,730
I'm from Pearson Hardman.
And I...

668
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,241
I had a few files
to bring your husband.

669
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,491
Where are they?

670
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,522
They're. They're right here. Um...

671
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,044
- Get out.
- Allison, what the hell?

672
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,925
ALLISON: it is 7:30 in the morning.
You think I'm an idiot?

673
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,884
- LOGAN: What are you talking about?
- ALLISON: I know that that's her.

674
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,844
- LOGAN: Oh, God. I told you I'm not...
- ALLISON: Stop lying to me.

675
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,042
ALLISON: At least be a man
and admit that that's her.

676
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,730
LOGAN: I don't even
know that girl. Okay?

677
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,046
And you think that
if I was having an affair,

678
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,881
that I would have it with a paralegal
from my father's firm?

679
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,085
Rachel.

680
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,522
I want you to stop the
personal attacks on Mike.

681
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,444
I know it sounds terrible, but...

682
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,167
And it's how the game is played.
I don't care. I want you to stop.

683
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,007
Look, can we talk
about this inside, please?

684
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,283
- I understand that you've...
- No. Look.

685
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,567
You say you're a changed man.
But what you're doing now, it's...

686
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,206
It's not a change for the better.
It's for the worse.

687
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,044
You told me this wasn't
going to be a problem.

688
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,771
And you stood

689
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,170
right here and told me that you
didn't love your wife.

690
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,648
And then, three months later,

691
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,282
you asked me to lie for you
so you could get her back.

692
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,887
- Rachel...
- You don't have to stop this

693
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,446
because you're some changed man.

694
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,003
You have to stop this, Logan,
because you owe me.

695
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,926
Okay-

696
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,040
Okay-

697
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,806
Louis.

698
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,446
Listen. I was up late.
I haven't had my coffee.

699
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,007
So, can we talk about
whatever this is in, like, an hour?

700
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,651
I'll be quick.

701
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,488
I ran into your enemy this morning.
You remember, Adam Grieves?

702
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,531
He asked me to tell you that you guys
are still on for ball on Wednesday.

703
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,961
- Listen, Louis...
- Everything you told me was bullshit.

704
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,562
You're not trying to get into my pants.
You're trying to get into Jessica's.

705
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,810
You thought you could move
your way up the ladder,

706
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,366
and you used my friendship
to cozy up to her.

707
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,729
- Louis. That's just not true.
- Well, then, what is it?

708
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,204
Why did you lie to me
to get me off this case?

709
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,283
Tell me what I'm missing here, Jeff?

710
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,566
- That's what I thought.
- Louis, please...

711
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,848
For once, I let my guard down

712
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,329
and believed that someone genuinely
liked me without a hidden agenda.

713
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,451
I will not make that mistake again.

714
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,850
LOGAN: I'm here to see Mike Ross.

715
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,210
What the hell are you doing here?

716
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,407
- I came to see you.
- I have a meeting.

717
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,164
I came to apologize.

718
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,601
For what?

719
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,402
For trying to win dirty.

720
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,282
I can't undo what I've already done,
but I can stop doing it.

721
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,689
I don't want to win that way.

722
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,721
That sounds like something
your publicist would tell Forbes.

723
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,047
Why don't you don't tell me
why you're really here?

724
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,883
You want the truth?

725
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,967
I don't want to hurt Rachel.

726
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,285
MIKE: Walter.

727
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,729
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Walter, please.

728
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,568
- You have 30 seconds.
- Okay. Look. I get it.

729
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,325
I tried to tell you
there's more to the story.

730
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,841
You didn't want to hear it then
and you don't want to hear it now.

731
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,883
But you need to hear this.

732
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,485
Whether you like me or not, I am the only
one in your comer and you know it.

733
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,921
I started this company
with no one to trust but myself.

734
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,924
If that's how I go out,
so be it. We're done.

735
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,041
Well, I'm sorry to hear that because
I'm going to be in your comer, anyway.

736
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,606
I just bought another
two percent of your stock,

737
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,246
which means I'm saving your
company with or without you.

738
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,563
Time's up.
I don't want to see you again.

739
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,729
- Jeff, it's late.
- It's not about us.

740
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,890
- Woodall.
- It started.

741
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,926
How many?

742
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,847
Seven clients, seven subpoenas.
All coming tomorrow.

743
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,930
It's time for you to
start earning your money.

744
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,525
You get me a present?

745
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,921
It's from Mike.

746
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,210
It's my dad's tapes.

747
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,490
He said they're yours.

748
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,930
- You got him to back down.
- No, but I got Logan to back off.

749
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,084
How did you manage that?

750
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,764
That's between me and my client.

751
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,331
You know you could have
come to me first.

752
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,650
I'm coming to you now.

753
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,525
After all is said and done

754
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,761
After all is said and done
