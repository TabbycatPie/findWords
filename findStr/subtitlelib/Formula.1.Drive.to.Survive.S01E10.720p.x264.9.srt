1
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:17,325
<i>It's been a brilliant year.</i>

2
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:19,565
<i>It's passed by in an absolute blur.</i>

3
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,045
<i>We've had a lot of stories.</i>

4
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,845
There's been drama. There was action.
There's been crashes.

5
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:25,965
<i>There's been everything going on.</i>

6
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:29,605
It was so up and down,
it was a roller-coaster.

7
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:34,525
<i>Strap yourselves in</i>
<i>and welcome along to the ride.</i>

8
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,245
<i>And a big crash there!</i>

9
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:42,165
<i>In Formula One,</i>
<i>the highs are very high...</i>

10
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:44,965
<i> Magnussen and Grosjean</i>
<i>will start fifth and sixth.</i>

11
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,445
Yeah, with the big boys, yeah?

12
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:49,045
<i> That is</i>
<i>a staggering achievement for Haas.</i>

13
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,285
<i> But the lows are very low.</i>

14
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:52,005
<i>What is happening down at Haas?</i>

15
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,205
<i>The wheels have literally fallen off.</i>

16
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:56,845
Fuck. We fucking look
like a bunch of wankers.

17
00:00:57,565 --> 00:01:00,685
<i>Romain Grosjean loses it.</i>
<i>Right across the track.</i>

18
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,125
<i> Oh, mate, I'm sorry.</i>

19
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:06,765
<i> Our drivers</i>
<i>have been phenomenal this season.</i>

20
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:08,605
<i>He's gone from sixth to first.</i>

21
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:10,325
<i>Did it, y'all. Did it. Whoo!</i>

22
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:12,605
I'm tripping major nutsack right now.

23
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:17,005
<i> Redemption day for Ricciardo.</i>
<i>He wins in Monaco!</i>

24
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:19,405
<i> This is my time.</i>
<i>It's my fucking time.</i>

25
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:21,925
Max had a difficult start to the year.

26
00:01:22,685 --> 00:01:24,005
<i>Oh, Verstappen's off!</i>

27
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,005
<i>Fuck!</i>

28
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,325
<i>Ricciardo desperate</i>
<i>to get past his teammate.</i>

29
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:30,445
<i>Double disaster for Red Bull.</i>

30
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:31,645
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

31
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:32,765
<i> Holy shit.</i>

32
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,365
- How pissed off were you?
- Very.

33
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:37,685
Why have you had so many accidents?

34
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,765
I get really tired of all the questions,
so I think

35
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,565
if I get a few more,
I'll head-butt someone.

36
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:45,165
<i>From Montreal onwards,</i>
<i>Max has driven brilliantly.</i>

37
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:48,005
<i>Max Verstappen wins</i>
<i>the Austrian Grand Prix.</i>

38
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:50,605
Yes!
Oh, this feels fucking good.

39
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:53,845
<i>Hang on a minute,</i>
<i>Daniel Ricciardo is going to Renault.</i>

40
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:55,965
<i>I just felt I needed</i>
<i> a fresh start.</i>

41
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:58,245
Have you got any money to spend
on your engine,

42
00:01:58,325 --> 00:01:59,685
now you've spent it all on your driver?

43
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:01,125
We've got plenty of money.

44
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,445
<i> It's been a good season,</i>

45
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:04,325
but there is still
a number of frustrations.

46
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:05,885
<i> Stop the car. You've got fire.</i>

47
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:08,045
<i>Sainz on the outside</i>
<i>of the Renault...</i>

48
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,485
<i>But now Grosjean, once again,</i>
<i>involved in a collision.</i>

49
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,525
I fucking... I don't know how long
I can live like this.

50
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:15,885
<i>Nico Hülkenberg's locking up!</i>

51
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:17,045
<i>And there's been a crash!</i>

52
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:20,805
<i>Fernando Alonso goes over the top</i>
<i>of Charles Leclerc's Sauber!</i>

53
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:26,245
<i>Wow!</i>

54
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:31,205
We are expecting
to have difficulty with McLaren.

55
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,005
<i>Not another problem for McLaren.</i>

56
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,125
<i>Turned out to be Haas.</i>

57
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:37,165
<i>Haas get</i>
<i>their best ever finish in Formula One.</i>

58
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:39,965
<i> Finally, I give you</i>
<i>what you deserve, boys. Whoo!</i>

59
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:42,605
<i>Grosjean comes home fourth place.</i>

60
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:43,645
Yes!

61
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:45,765
Right now, for us,
points are very hard to come by.

62
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:48,325
<i>Alonso and Sirotkin,</i>
<i>wheel-to-wheel!</i>

63
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:52,085
<i> Fucking stupid.</i>
<i>You take care, and they crash into you.</i>

64
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,165
McLaren is Team Fernando.

65
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:56,165
<i>When you have a driver</i>
<i>of Fernando's caliber,</i>

66
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:58,005
<i>you wanna keep them in your racing team.</i>

67
00:02:58,085 --> 00:02:59,405
<i>He's making the decisions.</i>

68
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:03,085
Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso
is to retire from Formula One.

69
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:06,085
Would you have stayed
if you could have had a competitive car?

70
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,205
<i> He's one</i>
<i>of the greatest drivers we've ever seen,</i>

71
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:10,045
so it feels like the end of an era.

72
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,205
We've done good steps,
but we need to go faster.

73
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:19,405
<i>Lewis Hamilton,</i>
<i>a five-time champion of the world!</i>

74
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,445
<i>Yes! That's the double, mate.</i>

75
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:26,245
<i>For the fifth year in succession,</i>
<i>Mercedes are the Constructors Champions.</i>

76
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:30,005
That's the last race in the season,
and it's still so intense.

77
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,205
<i>Ericsson's off.</i>
<i>And there's a fire.</i>

78
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:34,445
<i>Get out of there.</i>
<i>Get out of there quick.</i>

79
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:36,125
F1, it never stops.

80
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:37,805
Always finish the season on a high.

81
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,725
<i>You're gonna see drivers and teams</i>
<i>throwing caution to the wind</i>

82
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,165
<i>and absolutely going for it.</i>

83
00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:00,085
<i> One more time in 2018.</i>

84
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:02,645
<i>We've been around the world</i>
<i>from Melbourne in March</i>

85
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,165
<i>to here in Abu Dhabi in November.</i>

86
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:08,365
<i>The final round of the Formula One season</i>

87
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:11,685
<i>was set for a dramatic night,</i>
<i>under the lights here in Abu Dhabi,</i>

88
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:15,485
<i>the most expensive F1 venue</i>
<i>ever constructed.</i>

89
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:17,805
<i>The gloves are off.</i>
<i>The drivers just wanna go at it now</i>

90
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:19,925
<i>for one more time in 2018.</i>

91
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:23,805
Guenther, when you look back
on 2018, what do you mainly see?

92
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:26,405
Oh, that's a difficult question,

93
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:28,485
how much time have you got?

94
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,485
<i>Next year,</i>
<i>only two of the ten teams</i>

95
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:37,285
<i>are keeping the same driver lineup.</i>

96
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:43,045
<i>Fernando Alonso, his final race,</i>
<i>bidding farewell.</i>

97
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,045
Fernando!

98
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,925
-Sexy!
-Fernando!

99
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:50,285
<i>Of course, Daniel Ricciardo,</i>
<i>leaving Red Bull after this evening.</i>

100
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,445
<i>Going to the Renault team.</i>

101
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,405
End of term now, how would you give
yourself a grade for this term?

102
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:59,005
I'm gonna say
probably an "L"  for "loser."

103
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:01,045
Um... yeah.

104
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:02,925
Likeable. L for "likeable."

105
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:05,685
Or a "G" for "good-looking."
I don't know. One of those.

106
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,645
Let's stick to "L" for "likeable."

107
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,805
The second half of the season's been
a lot of misfortune really

108
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:13,005
and things out of my control.

109
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:15,845
<i> Basically lost the power.</i>

110
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:17,165
<i>Okay.</i>

111
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:19,485
Fuck!

112
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:20,765
<i>It's frustrating.</i>

113
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:23,485
And sometimes you feel betrayed by the car
when it lets you down.

114
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:26,965
<i>When it doesn't work, you just</i>
<i>want to express a lot of anger.</i>

115
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,965
<i> If we could finish</i>
<i>this weekend in a good way,</i>

116
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:36,725
<i>it would soften a lot of the blows</i>
<i>we've had this year.</i>

117
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:42,525
<i>Deep down, of course, my heart</i>
<i>would have loved a title with Red Bull,</i>

118
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:44,405
<i>just to complete the journey.</i>

119
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:47,805
<i>Right now, I'm just looking forward</i>
<i>to finishing on a high.</i>

120
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:50,605
<i>It's that satisfaction of knowing</i>
<i>that I've still got it</i>

121
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,565
and proving it to people
that I've still got a lot of fire in me.

122
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:56,645
It's a Sunday night. This should be fun.

123
00:05:56,725 --> 00:05:58,165
Monday recovering, I guess.

124
00:05:58,245 --> 00:06:00,685
Recovering from a victory,
from a hangover...

125
00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:01,965
A victory?

126
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:02,925
It's been a long time.

127
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:05,365
I know, I forgot
how to say the word "victory," but...

128
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:10,805
<i>We're going into the final race</i>
<i>with Daniel.</i>

129
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:13,325
<i>It's the last time</i>
<i>he'll put on the Red Bull overalls.</i>

130
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:17,245
Um... but as one chapter closes,
 another one opens.

131
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:19,565
<i>We're excited about Pierre Gasly.</i>

132
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:25,045
<i>And, you know, Daniel's leaving</i>
<i>to go to Renault.</i>

133
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:27,365
<i>Is he making the right career choice?</i>

134
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:30,765
No. The next year's one will be faster.

135
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:32,645
You reckon we will be slower?

136
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:40,045
<i>Daniel's still racing  Formula One,</i>

137
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,765
<i>so I won't necessarily miss him,</i>

138
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:44,925
but I'll probably wave at him
when I'm gonna lap him next year.

139
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:46,325
That's the target.

140
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:51,285
One, two, three. Go. And again.

141
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,565
<i>There's a lot riding</i>
<i>on this last race.</i>

142
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,445
<i>For Daniel, it's his last opportunity...</i>

143
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:59,845
to beat Max Verstappen as his teammate,
in equal machinery.

144
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:03,245
All right, thanks very much.
Have a nice Christmas.

145
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:07,045
<i> It's been a challenging year</i>
<i>in the beginning.</i>

146
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,965
<i>But since Monaco,</i>
<i>I've been driving a lot better.</i>

147
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:12,045
<i>I've been really strong</i>
<i>compared to Daniel,</i>

148
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,685
so definitely turned around the season.

149
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,725
Max, he's one
of the hardest racers out there.

150
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:20,245
He shows no fear.
He gives no quarter.

151
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,485
<i> Max Verstappen moves over</i>
<i>to the right hand side of Lewis Hamilton,</i>

152
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:27,805
<i>the race leader.</i>

153
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:33,085
<i>And there's a Force India</i>
<i>coming down the hill...</i>

154
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:35,285
<i> I have the Force India</i>
<i>behind me, pushing.</i>

155
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:39,845
<i>No! Verstappen's off!</i>

156
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,765
<i>What a fucking idiot! Fuck!</i>

157
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:46,125
<i>And that has cost him</i>
<i>the lead of the race.</i>

158
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:50,805
Max should have won in Brazil.
He was in total control of that Grand Prix

159
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:54,365
until Esteban Ocon tried
to unlap himself.

160
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:01,365
<i> Verstappen is absolutely seething.</i>

161
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:03,965
<i>That was Esteban Ocon.</i>

162
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:07,365
<i>Ultimately,</i>
<i>it robbed Max of the win.</i>

163
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:14,245
<i>But Max had the opportunity</i>
<i>to have saved himself all of that strife.</i>

164
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:16,365
<i>Just give him a little bit more space.</i>

165
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:20,445
<i>I think Max still has a little bit</i>
<i>of maturing to go,</i>

166
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:23,365
learning which fights to fight
and which to let go.

167
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:26,125
Max, can you just explain
what happened between you

168
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,325
and Esteban after the race?

169
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:29,605
Um...

170
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:31,565
I don't really have a lot
to comment on that.

171
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:34,365
Except that he was being a pussy.

172
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:38,845
- Okay.
- Okay. Next one, please?

173
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:47,645
<i>Like, I said at one point,</i>
<i>like, "You should understand my reaction</i>

174
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:50,485
if you could hear what he said
to me on the scales."

175
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:52,445
'Cause he basically
started laughing at me,

176
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:53,885
and then he was like,
"Ha, well, I was faster,

177
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:56,605
and so, I wanted to overtake you."
Like that.

178
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:58,445
He didn't even,
like, apologize for the crash.

179
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,365
-And that triggered me to push him.
-Yeah.

180
00:09:00,445 --> 00:09:03,725
What do you think about the incident
between Max and Esteban?

181
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:06,205
Whilst we don't condone violence
in any way,

182
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:10,325
emotions run high, and if they didn't,
they wouldn't be Grand Prix drivers.

183
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:11,365
Thank you.

184
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:12,805
<i>In the final race of the season,</i>

185
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,645
<i>there's an opportunity for Max to move up</i>
<i>the order by one or two places,</i>

186
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:19,125
<i>from fifth to third</i>
<i>in the driver's championship.</i>

187
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:24,205
<i>I think he's just very keen as well</i>
<i>to rubber-stamp the form that he's shown.</i>

188
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:28,405
Uh, well, we are closer than expected.
We'll definitely try to score a point.

189
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,365
Thank you.

190
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,765
<i> Max Verstappen, he could</i>
<i>really stamp his authority and say,</i>

191
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:37,405
"I'm gonna be a challenger
for the championship next season."

192
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:40,445
<i>So I think it will be hard for Verstappen,</i>
<i>but there's every chance.</i>

193
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,765
<i>Here we go, in Abu Dhabi.</i>

194
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:53,765
<i>Fernando Alonso's 311th and final start.</i>

195
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:56,805
<i>Daniel Ricciardo wants one more victory.</i>

196
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:59,245
<i>He's desperate</i>
<i>for one more win this season.</i>

197
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,085
<i>The cars lining up on the grid</i>
<i>for the final time.</i>

198
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:11,645
<i>Daniel Ricciardo in fifth.</i>
<i>Max Verstappen right behind him in sixth.</i>

199
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:15,165
<i> Daniel, just one rev check,</i>
<i>please. One rev check.</i>

200
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:17,205
<i>- All right.</i>

201
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:19,485
<i>This is it, fellas.</i>
<i>Let's fucking have it.</i>

202
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:22,845
<i>Could Red Bull have a little</i>
<i>problem on their hands this afternoon?</i>

203
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:24,685
<i>Because Max Verstappen</i>
<i>and Daniel Ricciardo,</i>

204
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:27,605
<i>they can't both be on a winning strategy.</i>

205
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:30,085
<i>Of course, Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>leaving Red Bull,</i>

206
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:32,085
<i>I would have thought,</i>
<i>if there's a choice,</i>

207
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,485
<i>it's obviously gonna be</i>
<i>Max Verstappen, isn't it?</i>

208
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:47,365
<i> For the final time in 2018...</i>

209
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:49,525
<i>...we're racing!</i>

210
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:52,645
<i>Max Verstappen,</i>
<i>what happened to him off the line?</i>

211
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:55,365
<i> Engine hot. Engine hot.</i>

212
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:01,685
<i>Verstappen is down in tenth place,</i>
<i>down at turn one.</i>

213
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:03,165
Oh, come on!

214
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:07,645
<i>Going wide there</i>
<i> is Romain Grosjean...</i>

215
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:09,445
<i>Alonso has been crowded out too.</i>

216
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,605
<i>Very low grip, but I will push</i>
<i>the tires to the limit.</i>

217
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:20,125
<i> Very good start by Nico Hülkenberg</i>
<i>in the Renault.</i>

218
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:22,285
<i>Doing a great job, Nico.</i>
<i>Push like hell.</i>

219
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:39,925
<i> Are you okay, Nico?</i>

220
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:41,885
<i>Nico?</i>

221
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:50,765
<i>Holy shit. I'm hanging here like a cow.</i>

222
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:52,885
- <i> Yeah.</i>
<i>- Get me out. There's fire. There's fire.</i>

223
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,165
<i> Is he okay?</i>

224
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:13,285
<i>What happened there, anyway?</i>

225
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,285
<i> Main thing is you're safe, Nico.</i>

226
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:16,205
<i>Who was that?</i>

227
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,605
<i> I think it might be one</i>
<i> of the Haases, Grosjean.</i>

228
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:22,565
<i>Hey, where did he think</i>
<i>he was going? Just turned into me.</i>

229
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:26,605
<i> Grosjean was</i>
<i>in the blind spot of Nico Hülkenberg.</i>

230
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:28,805
<i>Romain Grosjean did nothing wrong there.</i>

231
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:30,485
<i> The car landed on the roof.</i>

232
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:34,085
In that moment, I thought, like,
"Shit, you know... That's it. I'm out."

233
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:36,565
<i>I couldn't get out of the car.</i>

234
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:39,485
<i>I saw fire and, you know,</i>
<i>got some smoke and fumes.</i>

235
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:41,085
<i>It's not so nice to breathe them.</i>

236
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:44,685
It happens, and normally,
you check, yup, everything's still there,

237
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,805
brush it off and you move on.

238
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,245
- <i>Max, okay...</i>
<i>- Man, engine hot. Fuck!</i>

239
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:02,485
<i>Cool the car, please, Max.</i>
<i>Cool it.</i>

240
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:04,245
<i>That should help the engine.</i>

241
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,405
<i>Yeah, I'm fucked.</i>

242
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:08,925
<i>And Verstappen losing power</i>
<i>with his engine overheating.</i>

243
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,525
<i>Down from sixth down to ninth.</i>

244
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:13,325
<i>His teammate, Daniel Ricciardo,</i>
<i>is in fifth place.</i>

245
00:13:13,405 --> 00:13:16,645
<i> Daniel, let's buckle down.</i>
<i>Build up that rhythm again.</i>

246
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:17,685
<i>Understood.</i>

247
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:23,605
<i>What's going on with the engine?</i>

248
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:25,805
<i>Okay, you've done</i>
<i>a good job cooling the engine, Max.</i>

249
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:29,245
<i>-Continue to stay out.</i>
<i>-Can we use more power?</i>

250
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:32,285
<i>Yeah. Engine is fine.</i>
<i>Let's chop through this traffic.</i>

251
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:35,845
<i>Max Verstappen in the hunt</i>
<i>for teammate Ricciardo.</i>

252
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:42,605
<i>Perez ahead of Verstappen,</i>

253
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:44,525
<i>and he might fancy a go here,</i>
<i>and he does.</i>

254
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:50,525
<i>Well done, Max.</i>
<i>That is Ocon ahead of you.</i>

255
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:09,765
<i>Be sensible.</i>

256
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:14,245
<i>Verstappen's got the inside line!</i>

257
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:16,885
<i>Into Esteban Ocon he goes.</i>

258
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:25,085
<i> So don't waste time</i>
<i>with Verstappen.</i>

259
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:30,045
<i>Daniel Ricciardo third</i>
<i>and Max Verstappen up into fourth place.</i>

260
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,725
<i> Daniel Ricciardo needs to look</i>
<i>at his wing mirrors.</i>

261
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:46,685
<i>His teammate, Max Verstappen,</i>
<i>is closing in on him.</i>

262
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:53,165
<i>Daniel, that lap you went 44.5,</i>
<i>Verstappen, 44.0.</i>

263
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:56,645
<i>-The gap now 1.5 behind.</i>
<i>-Okay. Yeah.</i>

264
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:04,245
<i>Max is still fighting for third</i>
<i>in the Drivers' Championship.</i>

265
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:07,285
<i> So box and pit it, Max.</i>
<i>Box, pit it.</i>

266
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,765
<i>Yep. Yeah.</i>

267
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,765
<i>So, Verstappen</i>
<i> getting the early call.</i>

268
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:15,205
<i>Going then onto a brand-new set of tires.</i>

269
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:23,605
<i>Ricciardo's ahead of Verstappen</i>
<i>on the track,</i>

270
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:26,445
<i>but Verstappen,</i>
<i>he might be on the better strategy.</i>

271
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,445
<i>I don't think Red Bull</i>
<i>are too worried</i>

272
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,165
<i>about pleasing Daniel Ricciardo anymore.</i>

273
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:31,525
<i>He's off to Renault, isn't he?</i>

274
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:39,085
<i>Here comes Fernando Alonso</i>
<i>on Sergei Sirotkin,</i>

275
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:40,405
<i>down the inside.</i>

276
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:43,685
<i>Fernando Alonso</i>
<i>in his final Formula One race.</i>

277
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:45,165
<i>There's a point here</i>
<i>for grabs, mate.</i>

278
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,205
<i>There's a point here for grabs.</i>

279
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:48,165
<i>Let's go get him. Let's go get him.</i>

280
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:50,725
<i>I have 1,800 points.</i>

281
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:55,485
<i>Well, for me, make it 1,801.</i>

282
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:10,325
<i>Ricciardo and Verstappen</i>
<i>running third and fourth.</i>

283
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:14,125
<i>The gap between Ricciardo</i>
<i>and Max Verstappen is twelve seconds.</i>

284
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,725
<i>Daniel, box in this lap. Box.</i>

285
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:23,765
<i>Daniel, box. Box this lap.</i>

286
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,085
<i> Daniel Ricciardo will come out</i>
<i>behind his teammate, Max Verstappen,</i>

287
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:39,445
<i>and the chase now is on.</i>

288
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:42,685
<i> Daniel, Verstappen will be</i>
<i>about eight seconds ahead.</i>

289
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,925
<i>They've just shafted Daniel Ricciardo</i>

290
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,725
<i>with that early pit-stop from Max.</i>

291
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,325
<i>-Max, Daniel has now pitted.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

292
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:56,805
<i>Daniel is up 2.7 seconds</i>
<i>of Verstappen ahead.</i>

293
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,365
<i>He's gonna be fighting with Bottas.</i>

294
00:16:58,445 --> 00:17:00,885
<i>You're gonna join the party quite soon</i>
<i>at this pace.</i>

295
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,285
<i> Oh, that's clever by Verstappen.</i>

296
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:11,845
<i>Put Valtteri Bottas</i>
<i>off the track as well.</i>

297
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:13,205
<i>He just didn't see me.</i>

298
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:19,525
<i>Now, Ricciardo is right on</i>
<i>the rear wing of Bottas.</i>

299
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:22,325
<i>Okay, mate, you know what to do.</i>
<i>Let's have it.</i>

300
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:25,525
<i> Last of the late breakers,</i>

301
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:29,405
<i>Daniel Ricciardo puts himself up</i>
<i>into fourth place.</i>

302
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:31,365
<i>And the Red Bulls are really going</i>
<i>for it here.</i>

303
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:36,845
<i>The final few laps of 2018...</i>

304
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:39,325
<i>And once again, the Red Bulls</i>
<i>are right together.</i>

305
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,925
<i>Just 1.6 seconds between them.</i>

306
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:46,165
<i>Daniel Ricciardo has just set</i>
<i>the fastest lap of the race,</i>

307
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:47,765
<i>but it's not enough.</i>

308
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:50,765
<i> And final lap, Max. Final lap.</i>

309
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,085
<i>Max Verstappen</i>
<i>finishes on the podium for Red Bull.</i>

310
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:07,005
- <i> Nice end to 2018, mate.</i>
<i>- Yes! Oh, yes!</i>

311
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:10,445
<i> Max has driven brilliantly.</i>

312
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:13,445
<i>I think what he showed this year,</i>
<i>more than anything,</i>

313
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,085
<i>was his strength of character,</i>
<i>which, in this business, is everything.</i>

314
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:20,005
<i>Daniel Ricciardo,</i>
<i>a couple of seconds adrift</i>

315
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:24,125
<i>in his final race for the team</i>
<i>before he moves to Renault.</i>

316
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:26,485
<i>Daniel, great drive today.</i>

317
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,765
And yeah, we're gonna miss you.

318
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:32,845
Um... we wish you all the very, very best
for the future, and, uh...

319
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,845
hold very fond the memories
that we have together,

320
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:37,285
so enjoy this slow-down lap.

321
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:42,845
<i>Thank you. Thank you, Christian.</i>

322
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:46,605
<i>I feel I'm applying myself every race,</i>

323
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:48,645
but things keep happening
out of my control,

324
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:50,925
so that's been the frustrating thing.

325
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,885
<i>I just wanna do well. I wanna win.</i>

326
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,605
<i> Carlos Sainz holds off</i>
<i>the challenge of the rest</i>

327
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:57,325
<i>to finish sixth in this race.</i>

328
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:59,285
<i> Awesome job. P-6.</i>

329
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:02,925
<i> Whoo! Come on, boys.</i>
<i>That's how you finish in style.</i>

330
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:29,205
<i>Fernando Alonso, who drove</i>
<i>for Ferrari</i>

331
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:31,445
<i>and drove once alongside Lewis Hamilton,</i>

332
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:34,365
<i>joins the number one</i>
<i>and number two this season</i>

333
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:37,685
<i>in a display...</i>
<i>a really nice touch.</i>

334
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:44,165
I think the sport will miss him.
We will miss him. A true legend.

335
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:10,525
Well done. Thanks very much. Good job.

336
00:20:11,205 --> 00:20:13,005
<i>We're third in the Constructors.</i>

337
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:15,165
<i>I think it's been</i>
<i>a very solid year for us.</i>

338
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,685
<i>But it's a huge gap</i>
<i>that we've got to bridge</i>

339
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:20,845
<i>between ourselves</i>
<i>and Ferrari and Mercedes.</i>

340
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:23,885
<i>The Renault engine,</i>
<i>they haven't delivered.</i>

341
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:25,205
Moving to Honda...

342
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:30,725
Honda have the right resources,
the right commitment,

343
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:34,485
the right desire and ambition
to win in Formula One.

344
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:35,485
We want to win.

345
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:41,205
<i>We were the fourth best team.</i>

346
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:43,165
<i>Beat all the other midfield teams.</i>

347
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:44,965
And obviously, next year,
we're looking for the next step.

348
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:46,365
Ah.

349
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:52,045
<i> Moving forward, we need</i>
<i>to gain confidence that our ambition</i>

350
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,565
<i>to become the top team</i>
<i>and fight with the best...</i>

351
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:55,645
is credible.

352
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:59,045
<i>Daniel, we're expecting from him</i>

353
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,285
<i>that he will contribute</i>
<i>to the construction of the team.</i>

354
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:04,685
<i>Moving to Renault,</i>
<i>I'm expecting more for myself.</i>

355
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:07,165
<i>I want to have a presence in the team,</i>

356
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:10,805
<i>figure out the best way to really</i>
<i>bring the team to that next level.</i>

357
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:14,325
Yeah, hopefully it works for me
in the next few years,

358
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:17,045
um, but certainly, uh, yeah,

359
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:22,965
I'm curious to know what else is out there
and how I can keep bettering myself.

360
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:25,805
I guess searching for more from me.

361
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,845
-You're gonna keep entertaining us?
-Absolutely. Absolutely.

362
00:21:28,925 --> 00:21:29,765
Okay.

363
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:32,285
<i>Daniel, he arrives to a new team.</i>

364
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,525
<i>Him coming in,</i>
<i>I wanna do well for the team,</i>

365
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:37,485
but of course,
I also wanna beat my teammate.

366
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:40,485
It's a bit of a squeeze, no?

367
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:43,125
<i>Christian,</i>
<i>if we could come to you, please.</i>

368
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:46,205
<i>You're losing two things</i>
<i>after this weekend.</i>

369
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:48,125
<i>Renault and Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

370
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:52,325
Yeah. I mean, slightly awkward,
'cause I'm sitting next to Cyril,

371
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:54,565
who's taking, obviously,
both elements after the weekend.

372
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:57,005
Um... uh...

373
00:21:57,085 --> 00:22:01,205
I mean, Cyril was making the tea
when we first started with Renault.

374
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:02,405
And, uh...

375
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:06,845
-He's always nice.
-And it's had his ups and downs.

376
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:09,085
<i> We'd like to challenge</i>
<i>Red Bull, obviously.</i>

377
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:11,165
<i>That would be fun,</i>
<i>because otherwise I'm not sure</i>

378
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:13,245
<i>what Red Bull will be talking about,</i>

379
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:16,405
<i>now that they can't blame</i>
<i>the French partner anymore.</i>

380
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:19,765
Cyril, bridging the gap
to the other three big teams,

381
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:22,365
what are your expectations?
Your hopes?

382
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:27,085
Well, you need to expect
from us that we keep on progressing

383
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:28,805
and completing
the construction of the team,

384
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:32,205
and we expect Daniel
to play a key role in that.

385
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:37,525
<i>It's in our hands to deliver</i>
<i>the best possible result for the company.</i>

386
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:41,965
Cyril, you know, he is also
under pressure, obviously,

387
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,405
from the Renault board to show results.

388
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:46,405
Our ambition
is to be on the podium.

389
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:50,485
And now we are just
so close to the podium...

390
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:53,565
that I'm sure that next year
we can do that.

391
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:59,725
Now they're asking me
to slow you slightly down.

392
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:04,245
Just walk in a more relaxed way.
Just slower.

393
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:06,365
Full McLaren pace?

394
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:10,005
Just a little bit slower.

395
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:14,205
<i>I want to be fast</i>
<i>at least once this year.</i>

396
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,285
<i>I think Formula One</i>
<i>has been amazing to me.</i>

397
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:22,365
<i>But it's the right time to to move on.</i>

398
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:26,045
To the two-times world champion,
Fernando Alonso!

399
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,565
<i>We knew the day would come</i>

400
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:32,605
<i>that Fernando wouldn't always</i>
<i>be in our race car.</i>

401
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:34,085
<i>You know, life goes on.</i>

402
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:37,485
You know, it's been
a pleasure working alongside him.

403
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:42,805
<i>We've closed the chapter on '18,</i>
<i>and now super excited for '19.</i>

404
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:48,005
As soon as I saw
the McLaren opportunity opening up,

405
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:50,885
I also had no doubt
and I went for McLaren.

406
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:54,765
I feel so motivated and so happy
after this last race

407
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:56,645
showing what I was capable of doing

408
00:23:56,725 --> 00:24:00,525
that I go into McLaren tomorrow morning
already into the box

409
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,965
and I'm preparing the test,
I'm preparing next season.

410
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:04,565
Maybe take a couple of days
off, though, yeah?

411
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:07,165
I don't need to. I'm-- I'm ready.

412
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:12,925
<i>I've known Carlos for some time.</i>
<i>He's very fast.</i>

413
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:15,165
<i>A bit of a killer behind the wheel.</i>

414
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,645
<i>Commercially, the sponsors like him.</i>

415
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:19,125
<i>He's a handsome Formula One driver.</i>

416
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:21,325
Without talent,
you cannot drive these cars.

417
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:22,405
It's as simple as that.

418
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:24,845
<i>Sainz has pulled out</i>
<i>from behind the slipstream.</i>

419
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:29,045
<i>Nice move there!</i>
<i>Carlos Sainz, fifth place.</i>

420
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:32,005
<i> I feel privileged and lucky</i>

421
00:24:32,085 --> 00:24:35,685
<i>to be one of those 20</i>
<i>that knows that I'm quite talented.</i>

422
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:40,005
It's a totally new driver lineup
for McLaren in 2019.

423
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:43,565
<i>I'm Lando Norris...</i>

424
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,885
<i>and I'm the youngest ever</i>
<i>Formula One British racing driver.</i>

425
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:52,085
<i>To be announced as the 2019 McLaren</i>
<i>race driver, it's a dream come true.</i>

426
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:54,805
-Congratulations, first and foremost.
-Thank you.

427
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:57,725
-Who is the first person you told?
-Um, my mom.

428
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,685
-Think you're ready for this challenge?
-Certainly.

429
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:03,525
-Hi, nice to meet you. Congratulations.
-How are you? Thank you.

430
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:06,285
Well, you're obviously 18 years old.
Have you passed your test?

431
00:25:06,365 --> 00:25:10,085
I have...
And I've got a few points on my license.

432
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:11,485
-What for?
-Speeding.

433
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,525
They're never going to let you
forget that... ever.

434
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,285
<i> I've always wanted to be</i>
<i>a part of McLaren since I was very young.</i>

435
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:20,325
<i>Every year, I've basically taken</i>
<i>a step up into the next category.</i>

436
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:23,645
<i>From Formula Four</i>
<i>all the way to Formula One now.</i>

437
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,245
<i>I think Lando</i>
<i>will be awesome talent.</i>

438
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:30,125
<i>uh, statistically,</i>
<i>one of the best junior drivers ever.</i>

439
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:32,125
Coffee's not allowed in here.

440
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:39,325
<i>He certainly has the CV that would</i>
<i>suggest he's a future world champion.</i>

441
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,845
I think I'm being partnered
with Carlos for next year.

442
00:25:41,925 --> 00:25:43,245
<i>It's very exciting.</i>

443
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:46,365
<i> The two of them</i>
<i>is gonna be a great pairing.</i>

444
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:50,045
<i>The youngest pairing on the grid,</i>
<i>youngest pairing McLaren's ever had.</i>

445
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:55,125
<i> Lando, you're the latest</i>
<i>young driver to come into McLaren.</i>

446
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:57,325
We've seen Sergio Perez.
We saw Kevin Magnussen,

447
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:58,525
We saw Stoffel Vandoorne.

448
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:00,805
-They've all gone within two years.
-Yeah.

449
00:26:00,885 --> 00:26:03,285
<i>Are there any concerns</i>
<i>about following that kind of pattern?</i>

450
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:06,525
Nope, because I'm better.

451
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:12,925
We're taking some risk there,
but we think it's the right decision.

452
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,765
<i>In one sense, it's a risk.</i>

453
00:26:14,845 --> 00:26:17,765
In another, if it pays off,
he'll look like a genius.

454
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:26,045
-Good job.
-Thank you.

455
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,125
-It's a good season. Good job.
-Thank you very much.

456
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:33,445
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you, chaps.

457
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:37,645
If someone would've told me a year ago,
in Abu Dhabi, "Next year, you're fifth,"

458
00:26:37,725 --> 00:26:39,885
would I have signed on for it? Sure.

459
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:42,285
All right, I just want to say

460
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:44,845
you all can be proud of what
you achieved, guys, you know.

461
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:47,805
<i> I think we never have to forget,</i>
<i>we are only in our third season,</i>

462
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:50,045
and to achieve this is pretty good.

463
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:53,045
I don't know how many times this was done
as such a young team.

464
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,565
The challenge we didn't get to
is we didn't finish fourth, guys.

465
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:58,725
We had races
where we could have done more.

466
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:02,085
- I don't think that's tight.
<i>-  Failure, guys.</i>

467
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:06,685
One of our drivers in the first part of
the season had a few crazy moments.

468
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:14,925
If we don't make mistakes, we don't learn.

469
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:17,045
We had so much ups and downs.

470
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:20,165
It's quite amazing,
you know, how we got through this.

471
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:24,325
Do not be downbeat about this,
because we didn't achieve fourth.

472
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:27,205
You can be proud.
We can just get stronger, you know.

473
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:29,845
Thank you very much, guys.
Thank you. Thank you.

474
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:33,445
<i>The goals for next season will be</i>
<i>to just continue on this</i>

475
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:34,925
<i>and better it, obviously.</i>

476
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:36,845
<i>We want to fight for fourth.</i>

477
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:40,845
Guenther's made the decision to stick
with the driving line up

478
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,925
of Romain Grosjean
and Kevin Magnussen in 2019.

479
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:44,045
-Good job.
-Thank you.

480
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,125
Thanks for the season.
Thank you.

481
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,285
This year has been pretty consistent
from my side,

482
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:50,925
and I've scored points
at many different tracks

483
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:54,925
and at many races,
so I'm pretty satisfied.

484
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:57,445
Being able to come back
from a difficult start,

485
00:27:58,045 --> 00:27:59,405
<i>it takes a lot of energy.</i>

486
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:01,805
<i>It's a lot of pride as well.</i>

487
00:28:02,405 --> 00:28:04,365
<i>People were thinking,</i>
<i>you know, you were done.</i>

488
00:28:05,285 --> 00:28:08,405
Now I want to keep that good form
and not get into that deep again.

489
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,365
<i> Grosjean looks</i>
<i>like he's sorted out those problems,</i>

490
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:14,405
but if he hasn't, then that's gonna
really hurt Haas next season.

491
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,485
Yeah. You-- You stink. You stink.

492
00:28:17,485 --> 00:28:19,245
<i> Then you've got to look</i>
<i>at who made the decision</i>

493
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:20,525
<i>to stick with the lineup.</i>

494
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:29,085
<i>There's only 110 days to go</i>
<i>until first practice in Melbourne.</i>

495
00:28:30,405 --> 00:28:32,525
There's this false perception
that after Abu Dhabi,

496
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:33,805
oh, you go on holiday, you know,

497
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:36,285
that, "Enjoy your time off.
See you next season,"

498
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:37,885
and that we all turn up in Melbourne.

499
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:41,685
<i>But actually, the factory</i>
<i>is working massively long hours,</i>

500
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:43,245
Christmas is an inconvenience.

501
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:49,045
<i>That's where the new car, the 2019 car,</i>
<i>is starting to come to life.</i>

502
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:54,085
<i>Formula One is addictive</i>
<i>and it draws you in.</i>

503
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:57,725
<i>The characters, the competition,</i>
<i>the drama, the theater,</i>

504
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:01,845
<i>the performance</i>
<i>of these spectacular machines,</i>

505
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:05,485
and 2019 looks set to be a real classic.

506
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:14,725
If you could
just take a seat...

507
00:29:14,805 --> 00:29:15,965
Um... cool.

508
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,005
-Shots are quite tight, so...
-Okay.

509
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:22,125
See you, mate. Yeah. You're all right.

510
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,725
Make sure all the brands are...

511
00:29:29,805 --> 00:29:31,605
- I'll be here. Talk to me.
- Yep.

512
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:33,565
Let's do the interview
and then see what time we got.

513
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:35,845
Are you continuing next year or not?
Have you decided?

514
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,525
- Like that?
<i>-  </i>Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

515
00:29:37,605 --> 00:29:39,285
That's perfect.

516
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:41,085
You know I have
the worst memory in the world.

517
00:29:41,165 --> 00:29:42,245
I feel like Snowden.

518
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:43,405
- So, am I looking at you?
- Yeah.

519
00:29:43,485 --> 00:29:44,925
- Are we filming?
- We're filming.

520
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:47,165
- Okay.
- We are in this episode.

521
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:48,765
<i> Cool.</i>

522
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:51,885
Do you mind just saying your name?

523
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:52,805
Like...

524
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:54,845
"My name's Charles Leclerc
and I drive for..."

525
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:58,205
Okay. Looking at the camera
or looking at you?

526
00:29:58,285 --> 00:30:00,085
-No, look at me.
-Okay. My name is Charles Leclerc.

527
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,885
-I'm Pierre Gasly.
-I'm George Russell.

528
00:30:01,965 --> 00:30:03,405
-I am Carlos Sainz.
-I'm Lance Stroll.

529
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:05,165
And I'm a Williams Racing F1 driver.

530
00:30:05,245 --> 00:30:07,445
-I'm joining Ferrari.
-I'm joining McLaren.

531
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:08,405
I'm a Red Bull driver.

532
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:10,485
-It is a childhood dream.
-A huge honor.

533
00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:12,725
I don't know. I mean,
can I confirm that I'm moving?

534
00:30:12,805 --> 00:30:15,005
All the time I do something,
I wanna be the best.

535
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:16,765
It's incredible, no, how life is?

536
00:30:16,845 --> 00:30:19,125
Career goal is to become Formula One
World Champion.

537
00:30:19,205 --> 00:30:22,045
-World champion.
-It would definitely hit the spot.

538
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:25,365
To be honest, I don't think
they are even close to our level.

539
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:28,605
You still need
a certain level of maturity.

540
00:30:28,685 --> 00:30:30,125
You can talk as much as you want.

541
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:33,605
No hard feelings, I'm just looking ahead
to the ones we have to beat.

542
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:35,485
No, I didn't know.
What the hell? What was that?

543
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:39,165
A lot of people try to break your dreams.

544
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:41,885
-You can't please everyone.
-Obviously, the pressure is on.

545
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,085
There's always pressure.
You always try to do your best.

546
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:45,885
I'm very much looking forward to 2019.

547
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:47,925
We have to focus
on rebuilding this team.

548
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:50,605
Some teams will have got it right,
some teams will have got it wrong.

549
00:30:50,685 --> 00:30:52,845
Ideally, I wanna be on top of Daniel.

550
00:30:52,925 --> 00:30:55,045
-Priority is results.
-We can make the next step.

551
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,125
Race it and race it hard.

552
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:57,405
You know, I believe we can do better.

553
00:30:57,485 --> 00:31:01,005
The aim is to become a world champion,
and of course, sooner than later.

554
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:05,765
The only thing we can do here,
wait and see.

555
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:08,725
-I can tell you, we've got lots coming.
-We're on our way.

556
00:31:08,805 --> 00:31:11,405
Looking at me and Renault now,
that's all I'm interested in.

557
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:14,125
All right,
let's go fuck some shit up.
