1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,760
- Is Gene here?
- No.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,720
For Americans,
to travel is difficult, you know?

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,081
- Lucky for you, isn't it?
- Fucking hell, yeah.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,560
Yeah, I have to speak with him
every fucking day. He doesn't stop.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
Hi, Gene.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,120
I said to you, as long as we can afford
what you said to me,

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,840
I'm trying to... I'm doing my best

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,400
The target for the season
is to survive...

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
...as a team.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,600
Okay, gonna fix it, you know?

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,000
That is what we need to do
every day, Gene.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm wheeling and dealing at the moment,
to stay alive.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,480
How do you sum up
your season this year?

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,120
It's one short word.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,320
Shit!

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,840
What the fuck?

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,840
Fucking hell. Who was that?

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,400
<i>Grosjean has something of a meltdown.</i>

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,600
Jesus Christ.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,040
Brakes gone.

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,280
<i>Haas's problems continue.</i>

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,920
<i>Oh, Magnussen could be out of the race.</i>

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,480
- Sorry, guys.
- Fuck me!

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,000
<i>It seems so long ago
that Haas were celebrating.</i>

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,160
You know, just week after week
after week of constantly losing

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,760
is just not easy to do.

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,520
We can't keep running in the back.

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,720
I don't want to necessarily win,

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
but I want to be competitive
once in a while.

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,680
Thank you, bye.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,320
Fucking hell.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,040
If I don't do a... a good job,

33
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,280
I should be gone.

34
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,760
If you are not good enough,
you will be, uh, spat out.

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Action.

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,480
Like a professional.

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,680
At least I can do something!

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,240
<i>Hello and welcome to Silverstone.</i>

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,080
Good day to be back to work, huh?

40
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,320
<i>On the warmest day
in the British summer so far,</i>

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,960
<i>we welcome you to the British Grand Prix.</i>

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,080
Man, we should be fucking surfing.

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,360
Aah.

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,280
Keep "aah".
It's a good tone, that is.

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,680
Aah.

46
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,480
Sorry.

47
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,240
There's always room for dessert.

48
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,560
I know, but some desserts,
like, let's be honest, ice cream,

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,600
you could just keep picking
and eat the whole tub.

50
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,216
- I need a brolly.
- Want this one?

51
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,480
Tim, where's my brolly?

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,200
- It's fully the sun now, huh?
- Want an umbrella?

53
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,720
No, fuck off!

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,360
That would hurt my ego, you know.

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,080
Standing there with an umbrella...

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,016
- Wouldn't do much for my ego either.
- Yeah, fucking hell.

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,880
"It's a little bit of sun
and I need an umbrella."

58
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,960
Feet, touch the toes,
hold for five seconds,

59
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
back up, then carry on for another five.

60
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,080
I think being a small team
has got its advantages and disadvantages.

61
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,400
One of the advantages,
it's more like everybody knows each other.

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,600
Like family.

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,280
Big stretch
and then back again for five.

64
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,176
But I would say
it's a very dysfunctional family.

65
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,536
- Cheers, guys. Thank you.
- I'm knackered.

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,800
Haas has one
of the most stable operations in Formula 1

67
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,760
in terms of staff turnover.

68
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
It's like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.

69
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,440
Nobody ever goes in,
nobody ever comes out.

70
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,480
Romain and Kevin have been with us
for, uh, for a long time now.

71
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,120
Romain was there from day one

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,160
and Kevin joined us in our second year

73
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,040
and, uh, especially in Formula 1,

74
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,360
I don't think there's many drivers
which have been so long with a team.

75
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,600
- How's the hand?
- Getting there.

76
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,560
- Is it painful?
- Aches.

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,880
I'm Kevin Magnussen
and this is <i>Drive to Survive</i> Season 3.

78
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,856
- Hey, guys.
<i>- Hi, guys, how are you?</i>

79
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,440
Hey, how's it going?

80
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,840
<i>- Well, thanks. How are you?</i>
- Not too bad.

81
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,920
Haas has been my home in Formula 1
for the last four years.

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,520
When you spend four years with a team,
you become close with everyone.

83
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,400
<i>Well, we have five fans here.</i>

84
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,920
<i>They have questions for you both.</i>

85
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,800
I feel very happy here,
very comfortable.

86
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,200
I know what the team needs
and what they want from me,

87
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,040
so it... it helps you,
as a driver, perform better

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,160
when you have that around you.

89
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,760
<i>What do you listen to
on your headphones before each race?</i>

90
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,256
- Taylor Swift.
- Taylor Swift...

91
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,920
I've heard Romain listen
to Taylor Swift before the race.

92
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,680
I've spent five years
with Haas, wearing the colors.

93
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,120
It's been... it's really good, you know?

94
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,520
<i>Kevin, what do you listen to?</i>

95
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,080
I kind of like to listen to,
like, old Danish rock music.

96
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,120
Not good!

97
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,640
I've put a lot of effort,
a lot of passion and love into the team

98
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,640
uh, since... since day one

99
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,800
and always wanted us
to do better and better.

100
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,320
Where's the driver?

101
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,000
He's on his way.
He's on his last interview.

102
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,880
At the moment,
I'm not happy where we are.

103
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,680
The car last year wasn't good
and this year, we're struggling as well,

104
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,480
so we, uh, need to refresh ourselves
and rethink everything

105
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,640
and see what we do going forward
for the mid-and long-term,

106
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
not the short term.

107
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,440
- Hey, Romain. You all right?
- Yeah.

108
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,640
- How was your holiday?
- Yeah, good. Yourself?

109
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,680
After a very strong 2018,
the team started going down,

110
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,680
racing for the last position.

111
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,720
Now, we have absolutely no chance
to be on the podium.

112
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,000
- What about you? Do any drinking?
- Yeah.

113
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
Well, I put 2.5 kilos on, so must have!

114
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,216
He should've come out right here
and overtaken Räikkönen,

115
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,760
instead, he came out miles behind.

116
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,560
You learn a lot from tough times,

117
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,920
but you also... you get a stronger bond
in the team between everyone, and...

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,440
and that will make us better in...
for the future.

119
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,440
As we've seen
after previous races,

120
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,960
it's very tight
between ourselves and Alfa,

121
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,120
so, obviously, the potential
to get out Q1 is there.

122
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,360
Um, and, obviously that's the main aim
for... for us in this respect.

123
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,440
Our main rivals, they are Alfa Romeo.

124
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,320
I think the rest of the midfield
is... is a touch too far ahead.

125
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,560
Hi, Guenther!

126
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,160
If they're doing better,
I'm not getting upset.

127
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,200
Some you win, some you lose.
But I think they play always fair

128
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,080
and, uh, it's... for sure,
it's not good to... to lose against them.

129
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,720
I need to go to the press pen.

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,120
- You have three minutes.
- Got it.

131
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,240
Guenther is a colleague
and I am spending more time, uh,

132
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,120
in my life
with my colleagues than with my wife!

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
And...

134
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,960
How many assistants
have you got?

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,520
I have nobody because I have no money.

136
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,640
You've got three people
running around you.

137
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
- Yeah.
- Another one coming. Four now.

138
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,280
We can fight on track,
on drivers,

139
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,640
but at the end,
we are doing the same business

140
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,640
and we can sit down together
and have a coffee.

141
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,440
You're so stupid, Fred!

142
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,120
Fred and myself
are in very similar positions.

143
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,800
We are, I would say,
the only independent teams now.

144
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,040
He's got an owner, I've got an owner,
so we compare the notes.

145
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,680
Haas and Alfa Romeo are incredibly close
competitors in all regards.

146
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,120
Not only do they share
the same engine provider,

147
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,840
but their annual budget
is probably around the same figure.

148
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,120
But Alfa Romeo
have world champion Kimi Räikkönen.

149
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,360
<i>Here's your 2007 world champion,</i>

150
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,600
<i>Kimi Räikkönen.</i>

151
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,080
I'm Kimi Räikkönen
and I drive for Alfa Romeo Racing.

152
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,880
Kimi Räikkönen is
a valuable commodity.

153
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,160
He's got the expertise, the consistency,

154
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,200
a little bit more experience
he can bring to the team.

155
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,560
And he's keeping his seat for 2021.

156
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,920
<i>So, I do the countdown
and then, if you'd like to smile.</i>

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,920
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

158
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>

159
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,760
But he's a funny character
to try and read.

160
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,600
Are you a fan of interviews?

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,760
Never been.

162
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Still not so.

163
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,360
In the other seat

164
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,120
is one of Ferrari's junior drivers,

165
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,320
Antonio Giovinazzi.

166
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,640
Hello.

167
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,240
The first Italian driver in Formula 1 for...

168
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,680
a good long time.

169
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,120
<i>Give me your smile in three, two, one.</i>

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,080
<i>Perfect.</i>

171
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,400
- Giovinazzi!
<i>- Ciao</i>!

172
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,256
<i>- Hello.</i>
- All good?

173
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,120
<i>Yes.</i>

174
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,840
<i>I can't see you, Giovinazzi.</i>

175
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,240
I'm here. Good evening.

176
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,520
The first thing when my mom saw me,

177
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,960
is always,
"You look so skinny, you need to eat."

178
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
What will you eat tonight?

179
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,080
<i>I don't know.
Maybe rice, salmon and avocado.</i>

180
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,360
We were,
you know, a small family

181
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,880
from a town in south of Italy
called Martina Franca.

182
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,480
Are you, uh,
a bit of a hero in Martina Franca?

183
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,760
Yes, yes, yes.

184
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,880
Are you going out on your bike?

185
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,880
<i>Yes. Sometimes I cycle.
The weather is nice over here.</i>

186
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm proud
to bring back the Italian flag

187
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,280
in the Formula 1 grid.

188
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,440
Of course, also a little bit of pressure
because I'm the only one.

189
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,240
So, I want to do well for them,

190
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,040
uh, but yeah, just, uh, in the end,
I'm just really proud.

191
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
Are you tired?

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,840
<i>Uh, I will eat and go to bed.</i>

193
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,040
Perfect.

194
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,320
Okay, take care. Goodbye.

195
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,880
<i>- Good night. Bye.</i>
- Bye. Good night. Bye.

196
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,520
He's... he's wicked quick, Antonio.

197
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,920
But he has some sort
of wild and wacky moments

198
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,440
where he loses control of the car.

199
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
And it's a surprise
that they keep him on, really, for 2020.

200
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
And finish.

201
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,400
Starting with this one.

202
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,200
For me,
the main thing this season

203
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,520
is that I show to my boss my talent.

204
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,960
It's my dream to score a podium with them.

205
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,480
You know, an Italian driver, in, uh...

206
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,680
with an Italian brand
like Alfa Romeo in a podium,

207
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,120
so this is my dream.

208
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,080
Everybody is supportive behind him
to try to get the best from... from Antonio.

209
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,760
But at the end, you have to perform

210
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,200
and if you don't do it,
you will lose your seat.

211
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,840
That's life.

212
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,200
<i>Hello, everyone.
It's time for the British Grand Prix.</i>

213
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,440
<i>Haas have a lot to prove.</i>

214
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,720
<i>Guenther Steiner
will be feeling the pressure.</i>

215
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,520
A small team like ours
is supported by investors

216
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,160
and in times like this,
they doubt everything.

217
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,400
There's a lot on the table,

218
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,080
but it... it is not anything
that a great race could be changed.

219
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,160
RG hasn't finished
the last five Grand Prix here.

220
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,880
I just fucking want him
to finish the race.

221
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,400
- <i>Radio check, Romain.</i>
- Yeah, radio is very good.

222
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,560
<i>- Radio check, loud and clear.</i>
- Yeah, loud and clear.

223
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,160
<i>Okay, Kevin, have a great race.</i>

224
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,120
<i>Cars being fired up,
anticipation building.</i>

225
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,480
<i>We're racing at Silverstone.</i>

226
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,280
<i>Magnussen has already passed Albon.</i>

227
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,400
<i>Magnussen going
wheel to wheel with Pierre Gasly.</i>

228
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,760
If you back off
in a Formula 1 race,

229
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,280
especially on that first lap,
you'll get overtaken so easily.

230
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
<i>Great job.</i>

231
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,600
You can't give away too much.

232
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,960
<i>Whoa, there's a huge crash there.</i>

233
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,960
Ah, fuck.

234
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,880
<i>Oh my goodness me!</i>

235
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,960
He didn't even do one lap!

236
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,800
Is Kevin okay?

237
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,720
<i>Yeah, Kevin's okay.</i>

238
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,520
<i>Poor old Magnussen,
ending up in the gravel trap.</i>

239
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,480
<i>It's not what you want.</i>

240
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,840
<i>Keep pushing
to close the gap to Vettel.</i>

241
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,920
Antonio, we are currently P13.

242
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,240
<i>And behind, we have Grosjean.</i>

243
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,760
<i>This is awesome, dude.
Really good pace here.</i>

244
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,240
Yeah, I'm pushing as hard as I can.

245
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,160
<i>He could drive himself
into contention here.</i>

246
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,920
<i>- Box this lap.
- </i>Copy<i>.</i>

247
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,280
<i>A lot of drivers pitting.
Everybody pouring into the pits.</i>

248
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,200
<i>Apart from Romain Grosjean.</i>

249
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,880
Fucking just pit
when everyone else pits!

250
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,080
Fucking hell!

251
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,560
I'm focusing on time right now.

252
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,920
Get as many positions as I can.

253
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,360
<i>So, crucially,
that's put him into the top five,</i>

254
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,320
<i>but he's going to be really slow
on those old tires.</i>

255
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,600
Okay, boys.
The front left is really struggling.

256
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,960
Fuck's sake!

257
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,440
<i>Sainz is right
on the back of the Haas.</i>

258
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,640
<i>Good job so far.
Keep pushing, Antonio.</i>

259
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,120
<i>We slightly closed the gap
to the guys ahead.</i>

260
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
<i>Good performance from Giovinazzi.</i>

261
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,720
<i>He's just gonna keep plugging away.</i>

262
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,160
<i>Here comes Carlos Sainz.</i>

263
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,680
I really don't know what I can do.

264
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,200
<i>And Sainz up into fifth position.</i>

265
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,760
The rear tires,
they're going on me.

266
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,680
Please tell him,
"just stay calm." Calm him down.

267
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,720
<i>Here comes Lando Norris</i>.

268
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,040
<i>The second McLaren is through.</i>

269
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,000
We're gonna get done again in a minute.

270
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,920
<i>Ricciardo's next,
and he's now ahead of Grosjean.</i>

271
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,920
<i>Box, Romain, box.</i>

272
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,400
<i>Grosjean coming for his pit stop.</i>

273
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,920
<i>This stop will be crucial
to keep the Haas team in contention.</i>

274
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,960
<i>Oh my goodness.
It's a slow stop.</i>

275
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,200
<i>There's a gear in there somewhere.</i>

276
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,320
Are you kidding?

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,320
What the fuck?

278
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,320
<i>Can't believe what I've just seen!</i>

279
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Fuck!

280
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,080
Why couldn't I engage first?

281
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,120
<i>We will check. We will check.</i>

282
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,640
- We're last now.
- We are fucking last.

283
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,880
<i>Not been a good weekend
for Haas, has it?</i>

284
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,480
<i>Good job, Antonio. We are P14.</i>

285
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,720
The last two corners. Good job.

286
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,320
<i>Well done. Excellent race.</i>

287
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah, thank you very much.

288
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,560
<i>And here's Grosjean,
limping home, plumb last.</i>

289
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,040
<i>Yeah, dude, that's the checker.</i>

290
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm sorry, guys.

291
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Sorry.

292
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,680
Normally,
when you drive into the pit,

293
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,280
you go straight to first gear.

294
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,640
He went into neutral.

295
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,440
He fucked it up, you know.
It's his fault, yeah.

296
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,600
Oh well,
I guess we weren't getting points anyway.

297
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,760
No.

298
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,960
<i>Tough times now
for Magnussen and Romain Grosjean.</i>

299
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,800
Fucking hell.

300
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,200
Hi, Gene. Did you watch us?

301
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, yeah.

302
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,600
Uh, front and rear suspension
is for sure broken.

303
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Fucking hell.

304
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,040
And did you see with Romain?

305
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,600
No, no, no, no, no.
He fucked the pit stop up.

306
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,560
Otherwise we would have finished 11th,
Gene, 10th or 11th.

307
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,600
We would have been in front of Vettel.

308
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,360
No. No. No.

309
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,360
<i>I don't want to spend more money
on this team at the moment.</i>

310
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,920
<i>You need to find a sponsor.</i>

311
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,320
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

312
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,000
All right, Gene. No.
I'll speak with you in the week.

313
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Thank you, Gene.

314
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,640
Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.

315
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,320
I think, for sure, uh,
Gene was not happy with the results.

316
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,800
It's a very expensive business.

317
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,280
Money is, uh, less than it was before.

318
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,840
There is less income.

319
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,680
So, we need to find outside financing
to survive as a team.

320
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
The presentation is ready now.

321
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,960
How did you say you were gonna do it?

322
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,520
- I don't have my adapter.
- They must have an adapter there.

323
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,200
I was thinking
we say this is 15 million US dollars.

324
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,120
As long as I have the $15 million,
I'm okay.

325
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,520
On the sponsor side,

326
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,360
there's a negotiation
with a very well-known company

327
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,720
in Germany in the tech business,
and that is the partners you want.

328
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,000
It's very stressful, but I think
Gene trusts me that I can pull it off.

329
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Let's just walk and say hello.

330
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,280
- Hello, Mr. Steiner.
- Afternoon.

331
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,480
We need sponsors
to keep going with the team.

332
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,680
If a partner comes aboard, that would mean
somebody shares the cost of going racing

333
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,480
and we would be more than happy.

334
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,800
The drivers have also sent you
a little greeting

335
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,760
and I got it signed by both Haas drivers.

336
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,680
Personally signed?

337
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,480
Great, thank you.

338
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,760
- A warm welcome here.
- Thank you.

339
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,200
It is important to me
that we are included along the way.

340
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,920
And the question here is,
how can you include us

341
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,920
so we will learn to trust the team?

342
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,976
The sponsorship doesn't come as easy

343
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,640
as saying, "Sponsor me," you know.

344
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,160
For sure there will be mandates to follow.

345
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,240
Maybe
it's not just the sponsor that's new,

346
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,800
but maybe you also have a German driver.

347
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,880
This is enormously important for us.

348
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,360
Sponsors nowadays,

349
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,160
they want to have a little bit
of influence also in the drivers.

350
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,960
So, there is a lot to decide
and to weigh up against each other.

351
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,200
What is the best to do?
And, uh, it needs some thinking

352
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,280
and, uh,
to... to make the right strategic decision.

353
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,080
I don't want to promise
anything I can't do.

354
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,320
I can... I'm not saying it's a yes, but...

355
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,640
I mean, there are possibilities, you know.

356
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
- Okay, great.
- Thank you.

357
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,160
Bye. See you next time. Bye. Thank you.

358
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,440
Thank you for your time.

359
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,640
Bye. Thank you.

360
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,040
The easiest would be
to have tons of money,

361
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,840
just keep the same two drivers
and keep on going

362
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,320
and, uh, have no worries,

363
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,200
but there is a... a team
which needs to be kept alive

364
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,720
with the best talent
and the best finances possible.

365
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,760
It's quite a big responsibility.
There is sometimes tough decisions.

366
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,720
Will be very difficult for me to do,
to tell Romain or Kevin it's over.

367
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,000
They will be upset.

368
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,480
They are part of the family.

369
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,600
<i>The big news this weekend
is that Mick Schumacher,</i>

370
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,280
<i>rising star of Formula 2</i>

371
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,280
<i>and son of seven-time world champion
Michael Schumacher,</i>

372
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,200
<i>is here.</i>

373
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,680
Mick Schumacher could be the answer
to most of Guenther Steiner's problems.

374
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
<i>Ciao.</i>

375
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,360
Morning. How are you?

376
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
But...

377
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,240
Fred Vasseur at Alfa Romeo
is a very shrewd operator.

378
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,080
He also sees the kind of cash cow
that Mick Schumacher could be in his team.

379
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,760
Okay, that's fun.

380
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,520
<i>Mick Schumacher crosses the line</i>

381
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,360
<i>to win for the first time in Formula 2</i>

382
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,280
I'm Mick Schumacher, I'm 21 years old,

383
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,800
and I'm a racing driver.

384
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,080
My dad is Michael Schumacher.

385
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,960
He's seven-time world champion
and he's the greatest.

386
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,360
My dad is my idol, that's for sure.

387
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,520
Obviously, my goal is F1.

388
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,400
There are two teams

389
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,280
which haven't, uh, announced
their driver lineup yet,

390
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,760
which are Alfa Romeo and Haas.

391
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,720
So, yeah, we'll have to see.

392
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,440
I'm here now this weekend with Alfa Romeo,

393
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,120
just to get the insights to feel,

394
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,080
"Okay, how does a racing team
really work on a race weekend?"

395
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,600
I wonder if I printed enough.
Never had this many people.

396
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,760
There's a lot of rumors
surrounding the team.

397
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,880
Um, driver market and...

398
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,480
We're not focusing on any of those.
We're just focusing on doing our job.

399
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,680
Of course I know.
I'm not stupid.

400
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,480
I know that Mick is there
and Mick is doing well in Formula 2.

401
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,080
He is not my main focus now.

402
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,080
My main focus is, uh, is doing well,

403
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,400
and I'm sure if I'm doing well, I will,
uh, I will be still here next year.

404
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,400
I knew that Mick was part
of the Ferrari Driver Academy.

405
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,040
I was already watching him in,

406
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,560
um, in F3,
two years ago or three years ago.

407
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,280
I'm a competitor.
We always want to get more.

408
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,520
If you are happy with what you have,
then you are dead.

409
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,960
Mick is wearing
an Alfa Romeo jacket this weekend,

410
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,560
which doesn't mean
he's next year in Alfa Romeo.

411
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,400
Doesn't mean anything.

412
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,360
Gene, I'm working on the deal
as we said, you need to trust me on that.

413
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,600
Having a German driver
for a German sponsor,

414
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,040
obviously, is crucial.

415
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,880
<i>Mick Schumacher's coming in? No.</i>

416
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Because he's very sellable,
you know, and that's what my point is.

417
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,640
If I've got Schumacher,
I think I can find some more money, Gene.

418
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,656
<i>- It's good to have money.</i>
- Yeah.

419
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,560
So, if... if we get Schumacher,
I think I can... I can find some.

420
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,120
I hope three million.
Between three and five million more.

421
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,480
So, we have got a very good budget,
you know.

422
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,320
Mick, by winning the F2 championship,
for sure, is a hot property.

423
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,960
And with Mick, the other attraction is,
uh, we all know who his father is.

424
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
But what can be done? I don't know yet.

425
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,160
<i>But again the pace
of Rafaele Marciello...</i>

426
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,520
These days, for young boys...

427
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,440
<i>...Albert Costa off the race track</i>.

428
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,400
...it is impossible to make it into F1.

429
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,960
You need to think of the future.

430
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,040
Put some money aside
and think about another activity.

431
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,040
I don't know
the talks Mick had with Fred.

432
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,680
I don't know that,
but I just cannot wait around.

433
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,560
Let's do it this week.
I want to use the momentum.

434
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,840
No, we have to do it this week.

435
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,640
I have the offer on the table.

436
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,160
I just have to negotiate the numbers
with him.

437
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,280
I try to do the best
and try to make my point, why...

438
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,640
why he should come to us,

439
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
and... and... and work on the deal.

440
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
I should get a relatively quick answer.

441
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,840
Hopefully,
he will say this is okay for him.

442
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,920
Okay, let's do that.

443
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,920
A race is starting at two,

444
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,120
then I can't sit here
and be filmed by Netflix, you know.

445
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,720
Then I won't have a job anymore.

446
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,600
The situation is strange

447
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,560
when you have no idea
what's going to happen.

448
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,400
I have a very, very strong feeling
the team is going to change one of us.

449
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,600
I believe the future
is always in your hands.

450
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,240
But, obviously,
I am not the one making the decision.

451
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,520
<i>Radio check, Kevin.</i>

452
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,920
There has been competition from day one
with Kevin.

453
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,920
He's tough on track.

454
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,080
The decision to, you know,
get rid of Kevin or myself...

455
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,240
Put some oil on the fire.

456
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,360
If you want to go fast
at this one, you've got to have balls.

457
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,840
You've got to have balls
and you've got to know the track.

458
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,040
<i>The Haas drivers are racing</i>

459
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,040
<i>to try and stay in Formula 1
at this stage.</i>

460
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,480
<i>They'll be giving it everything.
They certainly will.</i>

461
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,320
<i>Green flag at the back.</i>

462
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,440
<i>Now we wait
for the five red lights to go out.</i>

463
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,600
<i>When they do,
we will be racing at the Nürburgring.</i>

464
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,760
<i>Lights out and away we go</i>

465
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,560
<i>for 60 laps around the Nürburgring,
it's the Eifel Grand Prix.</i>

466
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,361
<i>Magnussen in 14th
has had a rubbish start.</i>

467
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,040
Fuck me!

468
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,200
I'm on fucking ice.

469
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,520
<i>Grosjean's heading backwards.</i>

470
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,760
<i>He's lost four places from the start.</i>

471
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,960
<i>Fuck me. They have no grip.</i>

472
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,400
<i>Here comes Kevin Magnussen
to the inside of Kvyat, for 14th.</i>

473
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,280
<i>And he's done it.</i>

474
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,760
I got hit badly
by some gravel by Kimi

475
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,680
and it's fucking hurting my finger.

476
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,600
Are you okay?

477
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,960
I don't know.

478
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,600
I can't use my left index.

479
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,720
I hope it's not broken.

480
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,936
<i>It will be throbbing.
It will be hurting a lot.</i>

481
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,120
<i>In these cold temperatures,
you'll probably feel it even more.</i>

482
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,320
<i>Antonio Giovinazzi's
made a great start. He's up in 11th place.</i>

483
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,560
<i>Good job, Antonio. Keep pushing.</i>

484
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,760
Obviously heavy traffic.
Impossible to overtake.

485
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,400
Maybe we tell Romain

486
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,040
he's doing the same time
as the guys in front of him

487
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,920
just to keep
his, you know, spirit up, yeah.

488
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,960
<i>Pace is really good.
You're matching Gasly ahead.</i>

489
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,920
<i>Good job, mate. Let's get him.</i>

490
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,560
<i>Räikkönen to the inside of Russell.</i>

491
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,800
<i>Oh, he's got that wrong!</i>

492
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,360
<i>That'll be the end of Russell's afternoon.</i>

493
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,200
Oh my word. What happened there?

494
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,000
<i>Safety car. Safety car.</i>

495
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,520
<i>We've got a virtual safety car deployed</i>

496
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,080
<i>and as a result of that,
this could be pit-stop time.</i>

497
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
Box, box.

498
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Copy.

499
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,440
Somehow we need to tell Romain

500
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,640
that if he can do it on a one-stop,
we have points, you know.

501
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,200
<i>How's it going?</i>

502
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,320
I think tires are still okay.

503
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,280
We are thinking
of a variation on Plan B.

504
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,680
Okay,
think and I'll drive fast.

505
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,360
<i>While most of the drivers
are taking advantage of the safety car</i>

506
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,960
<i>to come in for new tires,</i>

507
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,480
<i>Grosjean looks like he's taking a gamble
and staying out.</i>

508
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,296
Okay, dude,
you're gonna be in free air,

509
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,640
so let's push on these tires
and get 'em going.

510
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,840
<i>Okay, Kevin, currently you're P12.</i>

511
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,160
<i>Romain's P10 on his one-stop,
ten seconds up the road.</i>

512
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,000
<i>Giovinazzi ahead is P11.</i>

513
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,960
<i>Antonio Giovinazzi looking
for his second points finish of the year.</i>

514
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,400
We have Grosjean ahead,
nine seconds.

515
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Copy.

516
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Is he pushing flat out, Antonio,
or what is he doing?

517
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,760
He needs to fucking push.

518
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,440
<i>There is Mick Schumacher,
watching on.</i>

519
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,440
<i>He's with the team all weekend.</i>

520
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,800
<i>These laps are good.</i>

521
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,000
You're a second quicker
than Hülkenberg ahead. Let's get him.

522
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,800
Fuck,
that's good times for Romain.

523
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,400
What's happened to Magnussen?

524
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,560
Come on. Come on!

525
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,760
<i>Okay, Kevin, currently P11.</i>

526
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,720
Vettel's behind us.

527
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,440
Mode push. Mode push.

528
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,600
<i>Here comes Vettel,
looking for the inside of Magnussen.</i>

529
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,240
<i>Magnussen tries to cut back.</i>

530
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,480
<i>He's not going to give up that easily.
That's audacious into turn four!</i>

531
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,920
<i>Vettel has the place.</i>

532
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,880
<i>Kevin, push like hell to the end.</i>

533
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,360
<i>- Let's keep going.</i>
- Okay.

534
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,440
<i>Romain, five laps to go,
1.3 back to Gio.</i>

535
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,480
<i>He's got Vettel behind him.
He'll come under pressure soon.</i>

536
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,520
<i>Grosjean ahead. Keep pushing.</i>

537
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,920
It's important to get Grosjean, otherwise
we risk to get out of the points.

538
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Come on!

539
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,240
Three more laps to go, Kevin.
Three laps.

540
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,240
<i>Starting last lap, Romain.
This is brilliant.</i>

541
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,920
<i>Hamilton crosses the line</i>

542
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,640
<i>to take his 91st Formula 1 victory</i>,

543
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,520
<i>and first points of the year
for Romain Grosjean</i>

544
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,880
<i>What a brilliant drive.</i>

545
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,120
<i>That is the checker, mate. P9.</i>

546
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,240
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

547
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,720
Yes, guys, yes!

548
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,840
Yes!

549
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,880
- <i>Well done, Antonio. P10.</i>
- Thank you.

550
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,160
<i>Checkered flag, Kevin.
Checkered flag. P13.</i>

551
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,640
<i>Sorry it didn't go quite right at the end.</i>

552
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,160
Yeah, good job, guys.

553
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,800
Thank you for the work and, uh,
yeah, you're the boys. You're the boys.

554
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,800
Thanks to everybody.
Great job, Romain.

555
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,960
Thank you, guys.
Thank you for never giving up.

556
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,360
Yeah,
that's not something we do, giving up.

557
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,520
We needed this, huh?
We needed this.

558
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,800
For the whole team,

559
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,040
scoring two points
was a bloody cool moment.

560
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,440
It felt really good, you know. Uh...

561
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,760
For us, P9 is... is the absolute best
on a... on a really good day.

562
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,520
Nice one, good work.

563
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,240
Well done.
We beat everyone that we needed to beat.

564
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,240
- Fucking awesome.
- Where's your broken finger?

565
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,720
- Here, getting better, but...
- Yeah. Is it broken?

566
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,360
No. Hey, hey, hey!

567
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,160
It's not broken, but it's blue.

568
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,520
Let's go. Let's go.

569
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,040
My new job!

570
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,240
- All right, so, forward planning.
- Forward planning.

571
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,720
- What do you know?
- What do I know?

572
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,840
What do you know?
What can you tell me?

573
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,320
Where are the balls in the air?

574
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,560
- Circus.
- Circus, yeah. Clowns.

575
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,240
Circus. Formula 1.

576
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
So, anyway,

577
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,600
I will decide which driver goes this week.

578
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,360
You know, it will be quite emotional.

579
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,920
You know, in an ideal world,

580
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,280
my plan would be
that we make that official

581
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,760
the Portugal weekend.

582
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,040
You want my job?

583
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,040
Wouldn't take the pay cut.

584
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,360
Okay. Three, two, uh, one.

585
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,880
Formula 1 arrives in Portimao
for the 2020 Portuguese Grand Prix

586
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,040
and a driver market
has been kicked into overdrive.

587
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,240
Just this morning,
the Haas F1 team announced

588
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,600
that not one...

589
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,680
but both of their drivers
would be leaving the team

590
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,480
at the end of this season.

591
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,160
In a way, exciting as well,
but mostly weird.

592
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,760
Gonna miss the feeling
of Formula 1.

593
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
Hello.

594
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,480
Well, news.

595
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,960
Uh, when were you informed,

596
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,760
or was it a decision that was made
between you and the team?

597
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,240
Guenther called me a week ago or so,

598
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,240
um, to tell me that

599
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,640
they were, uh, gonna go for other drivers.

600
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,000
Maybe I'm ignorant,
but I... I felt pretty confident...

601
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,840
...that they'd keep me.

602
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,160
You know, Formula 1 can be a cold place,

603
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,280
uh...

604
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
a lot of the time.

605
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,000
Anyhoo...
Yeah, I mean, bottom line is

606
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,696
everyone knows you're gonna
drive the absolute nuts off of this car

607
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,000
until the end of the season.

608
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,840
- You won't take your foot off the gas.
- Absolutely.

609
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,440
But I will always, you know, look back

610
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,000
and... and be disappointed
that I didn't become a world champion.

611
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,520
You know, yes, I'm sad
about not being able to continue,

612
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,760
but I think it's overwhelmingly...

613
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,600
You know, I'm more grateful than sad
about things, you know.

614
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,440
- Thanks, Kevin.
- Thank you.

615
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,120
I'm not really done
with Formula 1,

616
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,880
but maybe Formula 1's done with me.

617
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
It's not good for me.

618
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,520
It was, you know,
um, collateral damage, if you want, but,

619
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,320
uh, you know, nothing I can say.

620
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,360
Uh, fair enough. I understand.

621
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,360
Uh, and, uh, we move on.

622
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,360
Uh, to make a decision
to let people go,

623
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,000
it's never a nice thing to do

624
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,440
and, for sure,
somebody's feelings get hurt.

625
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,880
But especially with Romain and Kevin,
they got to be friends.

626
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,080
It is not easy,
but all good things have, uh, an end.

627
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,000
I just have to say hello to him.

628
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,120
- Are you still saying hello to me?
- Huh?

629
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,656
- Still saying hello?
- Yeah.

630
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,000
I know that, yeah.
I'm just joking.

631
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,440
It seems to have been managed
pretty good, you know.

632
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,480
As we said, we are not damaging anybody.
That's the last thing I want to do.

633
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,880
You know that I mean that.

634
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,760
- Because otherwise...
- For sure.

635
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,560
- It's never nice, but hey.
- Yeah.

636
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,016
Life is not <i>ein Wunschkonzert,</i>
as we say in German.

637
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,560
You know? Fucking hell, yeah.

638
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,520
You've got rid
of your sort of two adopted sons.

639
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Uh, so, what's next? Who's coming in?

640
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,360
You're persisting to try to find out
which direction we are going.

641
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,040
<i>Venturing into
a Formula 1 weekend for the first time...</i>

642
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
<i>Mick Schumacher.</i>

643
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,360
Next year, we'll have Mick Schumacher
and, uh, Nikita Mazepin as our drivers.

644
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,080
Nikita Mazepin
is one of the talented drivers

645
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,520
in Formula 2 this year

646
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,960
and, uh, his father, he has got
a very successful company as well,

647
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
which he may want to promote.

648
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,200
- Hi.
- Hello.

649
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,000
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

650
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,400
I was pretty happy
that the rumor mill

651
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,760
was that Mick is going to Alfa

652
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,760
because that distracted
the real negotiations, you know?

653
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,480
It was announced that
Mick Schumacher's gonna be in the car.

654
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,720
Why did you pick Mick?

655
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,360
It's going to be tough for a rookie
next year, isn't it?

656
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,480
I'm sure there will be criticism.
"Two rookies cannot work."

657
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,720
It will be very difficult.
I know the challenge in front of us,

658
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,120
but because nobody has ever done it,
it doesn't mean that it's wrong.

659
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,680
No risk, no fun!

660
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,856
Sainz is going to Ferrari.

661
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,160
- How much are you gonna miss him?
- Uh...

662
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,840
How is this relationship
going to continue?

663
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,440
<i>Okay, Carlos.
No fight with Lando. Let him go.</i>

664
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,360
Fucking hell.

665
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,200
He just turned in on me.
What's he trying to do?

666
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,600
I'm pretty angry.

667
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,000
<i>A very, very nasty crash.</i>

668
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,360
<i>Red flag.</i>

669
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,920
Once you see fire,
that's the worst thing you can have.

670
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,720
You don't think anybody can get out alive
of this one.
