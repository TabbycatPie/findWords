1
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:10,416
[wind whistling]

2
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,625
[Jolene] You should have seen yourself.

3
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,666
Up on that stool,
floating around up there,

4
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,958
Deardorff just hollering at you.

5
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,625
It felt funny.

6
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:25,541
Shit.

7
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,666
I bet it felt good.

8
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,500
[Beth sighs]

9
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,958
What you gonna do at night?

10
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,916
I'm gonna stay awake as long as I can,
reading my book,

11
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,625
learning the Sicilian Defense.

12
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,375
There's 57 pages about it in the book,

13
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,791
with 170 lines stemming from P to QB4.

14
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,583
I'm gonna memorize them
and play through them all in my mind.

15
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:55,833
Poor mind.

16
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,416
-[girls laughing]
-[woman] Ladies, don't run!

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,791
No shoving!

18
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,875
[indistinct chattering and giggling]

19
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,208
[Beth] Mr. Shaibel?

20
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,083
They won't let me play anymore.

21
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,125
I'm being punished.

22
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,041
Please…

23
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,708
can you help me?

24
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,791
[sighs]

25
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,833
I wish I could play more with you.

26
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,958
[somber music playing]

27
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,958
For crying out loud,
what you still doing in bed?

28
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,458
You're gonna miss breakfast.

29
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:21,750
[Jolene sniffles]

30
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,666
Morning, cracker.

31
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,125
[clears throat]

32
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,708
You don't wanna miss
another delicious breakfast, do you?

33
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,208
[Beth] Been dreaming about it.

34
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,666
[birds chirping]

35
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,000
Wonder who they're here for.

36
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,791
[girls] Hi, Beth.

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,750
-Are you trying to piss her off?
-I had to take a shower.

38
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:07,666
Go on in, then.

39
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,458
Hold up.

40
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,875
They seem like nice people.

41
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm told, Elizabeth,
that you turned 13 just last month.

42
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,083
Actually, I'm fift--

43
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,208
Yes, that's right, I'm 13.

44
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,166
Such a wonderful age.

45
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,541
Elizabeth has performed well
in all of her schoolwork.

46
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:48,833
She is at the top of her class
in reading and arithmetic.

47
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,083
That's very impressive.

48
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,083
Beth is also a very strong student
in science and geography,

49
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,375
and has been kindly assisting
Miss Lonsdale with chapel,

50
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,125
for several years now.

51
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,125
She is the model Methuen girl.

52
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,041
I can see that.

53
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,791
I will leave you three to get acquainted.

54
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,000
[door opens]

55
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,000
-[door closes]
-[man clears throat]

56
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,250
They call you Elizabeth?

57
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,291
Or is it Betty?

58
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,791
You should go pack.

59
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,083
[car engine turns over]

60
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,375
I can't find my book.

61
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,458
Which book we talking about?
You read like a hundred of them.

62
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,708
Modern Chess Openings.

63
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,000
Hm. Beats the shit out of me.

64
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,500
I left it right here.

65
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,791
-You didn't see it, did you?
-Watch who you go accusing.

66
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,541
I got no use for no book like that.

67
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,375
Anyway, you don't need no book.

68
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:26,583
Just say, "Yes, sir," and "Yes, ma'am,"
and you'll do all right.

69
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:30,250
Tell them you're grateful
to be in a Christian home like theirs.

70
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,416
Maybe they'll put a TV in your room.

71
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,250
Jolene?

72
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,458
[Jolene] Hm?

73
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,875
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,291
About what?

75
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,625
That you didn't get adopted.

76
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:53,875
Shit.

77
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,416
I make out just fine right here.

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
[pensive music playing]

79
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,166
Be a good girl, Elizabeth.

80
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,500
Off we go!

81
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,500
[sighs]

82
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,583
We're so glad to have an older child.

83
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,875
[man sniffs, clears throat]

84
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,375
[uplifting music playing]

85
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,291
Shall we?

86
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,208
[door closes]

87
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,041
Home sweet home.

88
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,000
[woman] Those are Rosa Bonheur prints.

89
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,166
Not originals, of course.

90
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,000
Do you like animals?

91
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,291
I do, I love them.

92
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,750
Allston is allergic
to most pet dander, though,

93
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,833
-so I'm not allowed to--
-[Allston clears throat]

94
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,250
I bet you'd like to see your room.

95
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,375
This is the master bedroom,
where Allston and I sleep.

96
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,833
Over here is the bathroom,

97
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,875
and this is you.

98
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,500
You have no idea how hard it is
to find good maple furniture.

99
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,708
This is all mine?

100
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,916
Of course it's all yours.

101
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,000
The whole room?

102
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,208
The whole room.

103
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,208
All right.

104
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,750
I will let you unpack and get settled in.

105
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Just give a holler if you need anything.

106
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,541
[lock clicks]

107
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,833
Home sweet home.

108
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,041
[uplifting music continues]

109
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,041
[exhales]

110
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,208
[woman] I don't understand.

111
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,541
[Allston] I don't know exactly
what there is to understand.

112
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,708
-[woman] Why can't they send someone else?
-[Allston] It's only for two weeks.

113
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,791
[woman]
You've only been home for two days.

114
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,708
[Allston] Gives you some time
to get to know your new companion.

115
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,333
I doubt there's much to know.

116
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,625
Girl doesn't seem
to have a heck of a lot to say.

117
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,208
[woman] Do you have to take the car?

118
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,458
How am I supposed
to get around without a car?

119
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,375
I don't know, you could rent one.

120
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,541
And eat up half my commissions?
You're a terrible driver anyway.

121
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,458
It's not that far into town.

122
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,708
Remember what the doctor said.
Some exercise will do you good.

123
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,000
-[car door shuts]
-[engine turns over]

124
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,666
[car drives away]

125
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,750
[melancholy music playing on piano]

126
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,333
[woman] It's early, dear.

127
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,291
You don't have to be up
for another hour yet.

128
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,750
Must be all the excitement
about your first day of school.

129
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,916
Where did Mr. Wheatley go?

130
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,583
Business trip.

131
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,375
Poor man has to travel
quite a bit these days, but…

132
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,000
as he likes to remind me, it…

133
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,666
keeps the roof over our heads.

134
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,625
Please stop gawking, dear,
you're making me nervous.

135
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,875
You're very good.

136
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,000
This was Grandmother June's piano.

137
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,458
I've played since I was younger than you.

138
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,000
I'd always had it in my mind
to one day play in an orchestra.

139
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,000
Probably still could.

140
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,041
Mmm. As luck would have it,

141
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,125
I've also always suffered
from a terrible case of stage fright,

142
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,375
which does not bode well
for an aspiring performer.

143
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,166
And then I got pregnant.

144
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,083
You have a child?

145
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,250
We did, yes.

146
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,291
Are you hungry?

147
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,791
We have a leftover casserole.

148
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,875
[Mrs. Wheatley] Beth, dear.

149
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,250
Are you sure
you don't want me to go with you?

150
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,208
[Beth] I'm okay.

151
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,416
Okay.

152
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,291
[uplifting orchestral music playing]

153
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,708
[students chattering indistinctly]

154
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,666
[girl 1] You should have seen that coach.

155
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,916
Have you seen her hair and her shoes?

156
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
[girls laugh]

157
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,333
[girl 2] Don't know.

158
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,000
[girls continue indistinctly]

159
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,000
[girl 2] So drab.

160
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,583
And brown laces
with brown shoes? I mean… [scoffs]

161
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,416
[teacher] Quiet, please! Let's start.

162
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,666
This week, we will begin to study
the binomial theorem.

163
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,375
Does anyone know what a binomial is?

164
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:42,708
Anyone?

165
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,416
[student clears throat]

166
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:50,916
[teacher] Yes?

167
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,750
-A binomial is a mathematical--
-Will you stand up, please?

168
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,833
A binomial is a mathematical expression
containing two terms.

169
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,958
X plus Y is a binomial.

170
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,125
Very good.

171
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,291
Let's turn to page 24.

172
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,625
[whispering] Great, another fucking brain.

173
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,833
[girl chuckles]

174
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,041
[indistinct chatter]

175
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,583
[girl] That's a good idea. Oh, my god.

176
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,625
[tittering]

177
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,166
[tray slams]

178
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,875
[clears throat]

179
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,416
-Is there a school chess club?
-What?

180
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,208
Is there a chess club here at the school?

181
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,291
Oh.

182
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:16,916
Um…

183
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,625
I don't think they have
anything like that.

184
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,083
But a lot of the girls
belong to social clubs.

185
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,458
Social clubs?

186
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,375
There's the Apple Pi club,

187
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,750
and the Sub Debs,

188
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,166
-and Girls Around Town.
-Apple pie? They bake pies?

189
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,833
No, Apple Pi.
You know, like the Greek letter.

190
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,083
Oh.

191
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,125
Are you in one of those?

192
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,708
You have to be invited…

193
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,291
to join.

194
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,125
You could try out for junior cheerleader.

195
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,083
[vacuum cleaner whirring loudly]

196
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,750
[Mrs. Wheatley yelps] Shit.

197
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,250
[footsteps ascend rapidly]

198
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,375
[door opens]

199
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,083
-[Allston sighs]
-[door closes]

200
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,166
[Allston clears throat]

201
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,958
Hello, Mr. Wheatley.

202
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,375
Oh.

203
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,208
Hi… Beth.

204
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,458
[Mrs. Wheatley] You're home!
I didn't expect you for another week.

205
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,666
I'm only here for the night.

206
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,416
They, uh…
they just gave me the whole Southwest, so…

207
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,333
-[kiss]
-[Mrs. Wheatley] And a raise, I hope?

208
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,625
[Allston] Don't start.

209
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,708
Yes, why don't you freshen up,
and I will start dinner?

210
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:46,875
I'll take a beer.

211
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,125
If there's any left.

212
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,083
Doesn't she ever change clothes?

213
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,500
I don't think he likes me very much.

214
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,833
Quite the opposite.

215
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,708
Adopting you was actually his idea.

216
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,875
He's right, though.
You could use some new clothes.

217
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,750
-[bus screeches to stop]
-[doors squeak open]

218
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,041
[bus driver] Sorry.

219
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,916
[indistinct conversations]

220
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,166
[cheerful music playing over speakers]

221
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,666
[Mrs. Wheatley] Aha!

222
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,666
They have chess sets.

223
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,750
We can stop on the way back down.

224
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,875
[Mrs. Wheatley] Oh…

225
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,416
Let's find you a blouse.

226
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,208
Well, don't you look lovely?

227
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,291
[Beth] The shoes are a little big.

228
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,458
Room to grow, dear.
Room to grow.

229
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,708
Let's look for coats.

230
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,083
Mmm. Lovely.

231
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,333
Step over here
so I can see the fabric in the light.

232
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,041
Yes, this will do nicely.

233
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,625
Aren't we gonna look at the chess sets?

234
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,208
Another time, dear.

235
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,666
It's getting late, and I'm getting hungry.

236
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,000
-But--
-I'll give you 40 cents a week allowance.

237
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,208
Save up and buy yourself a chess set.

238
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,166
Saving is a good lesson
for a girl to learn.

239
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,833
[students chatting indistinctly]

240
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,625
[girls titter]

241
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,833
[tittering]

242
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,125
[girls laugh tauntingly]

243
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,000
-[thud]
-[girls giggle]

244
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,875
[girl] So bad!

245
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,541
[items clatter in locker]

246
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,500
[clears throat]

247
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,833
-Do you have any books on chess?
-[librarian] Chess?

248
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,375
Mm. I don't know for sure.

249
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,583
If we have anything,
it'll be on the last row.

250
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,458
Thank you.

251
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,041
There might be an old biography
on José Capablanca.

252
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,541
-Who?
-José Capablanca.

253
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,625
He was a Grandmaster.
It was quite a long time ago now.

254
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,083
What's a Grandmaster?

255
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,541
A genius player.

256
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,500
[kissing, heavy breathing]

257
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,958
[girl breathing heavily]

258
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,583
[girl] Okay, yeah.

259
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,458
I see you, Harmon.

260
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,625
It's those shoes.

261
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,708
Did you get them
at Ben Snyder's or something?

262
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,916
I wouldn't be caught dead
in Ben Snyder's.

263
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
[boy chuckles]

264
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,875
[door closes]

265
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,875
-[Mrs. Wheatley] How was school?
-Fun.

266
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:01,708
Where are you going?

267
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,791
I'm gonna replay
some of the matches in this book.

268
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,833
-But you don't have a board.
-In my head.

269
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,166
Good mental exercise.

270
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,958
Well, some physical exercise
could do you good.

271
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:20,125
Will you run over to Bradley's for me,

272
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,500
and pick up three packs of Chesterfields?

273
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,208
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,750
I'll write you a note.

275
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,583
You look a bit youthful
for smoking, yourself. [chuckles]

276
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,416
[rain pattering]

277
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:51,750
[bell dings]

278
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,000
[door closes]

279
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,541
[sports announcer
speaking indistinctly on radio]

280
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,750
[Beth clears throat]

281
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:40,000
[pensive music playing]

282
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,208
[Bradley] Young lady!

283
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:16,000
You have to buy the magazine
or put it back.

284
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,583
-Can't I just--
-You wanna read? Read the sign.

285
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,458
[Bradley] No, it's all the same oil,
it's just three different sizes.

286
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,208
If you don't use a lot,
you wanna buy that one,

287
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:51,500
because it does go bad,
but this is the best value for the money.

288
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,750
If you can't decide, get the middle one.
It's not rocket science.

289
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
[uplifting orchestral music playing]

290
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:06,916
[utensils clattering]

291
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,500
[Mrs. Wheatley] Thank you, dear.

292
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:22,291
Well, that's the last
of the instant coffee.

293
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,750
I'd go shopping, but I just don't know
where all the money goes.

294
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,125
I've bought little more
than trifles this month,

295
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:32,000
and yet I have seven dollars left
where I should have at least 20.

296
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,000
Seven dollars?

297
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,708
-Is that enough?
-To last till the end of October?

298
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:37,625
I think not.

299
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,625
It'll scarcely buy
chicken necks and porridge.

300
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:43,791
-Doesn't Methuen send you a check?
-For 80 dollars.

301
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,625
And only for the first year.

302
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:48,375
As if the expense of keeping you
doesn't exhaust it.

303
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,625
I'm afraid you'll have to go
without an allowance

304
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:54,916
until Allston returns.

305
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:57,750
Which is when?

306
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:58,750
Who can say?

307
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,083
It seems he's been
unavoidably detained out West.

308
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,000
Maybe I could get a job.

309
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,000
A job?

310
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:16,166
I could work in a store,
or wash dishes somewhere.

311
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,375
Wash dishes?

312
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:18,875
I'd like to make some money.

313
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:21,708
Oh, to buy clothes with, I suspect.

314
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,291
To enter chess tournaments.

315
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:27,458
There's one here.

316
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,958
But it's five dollars
for the entrance fee.

317
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,416
The only girls of your age
who work are colored.

318
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:39,500
[Beth] Dear Mr. Shaibel,

319
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:44,333
there's a chess tournament here
with a first prize of 100 dollars,

320
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:46,375
and a second prize of 50 dollars.

321
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,791
There are other prizes, too.

322
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,208
[thoughtful music playing]

323
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:55,041
It costs five dollars to enter,
and I don't have that.

324
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,250
If you'll send me the money,

325
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,750
I will pay you back ten dollars
if I win any prize at all.

326
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,875
[Alma coughing]

327
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,416
[Alma] Beth, is that you?

328
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,083
[chuckles] I seem to have caught a cold.

329
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:22,625
Another one?

330
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,250
Mm. I have a proclivity for viruses, or…

331
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,625
they for me. [chuckles]

332
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,416
Uh… here.

333
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,916
I need you
to fill this prescription for me.

334
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,291
And while you're there…

335
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,416
buy yourself a Coke. [chuckles]

336
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:41,541
[TV playing indistinctly]

337
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,041
-Thanks.
-[chuckles]

338
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:47,333
[sports announcer speaks indistinctly
over radio]

339
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,208
Be just a minute.

340
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:01,708
[pills clattering]

341
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:05,291
[Bradley] Here you go.

342
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,958
[Mrs. Wheatley] My tranquility medicine.
[chuckles]

343
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:21,791
Dr. Talbott has decided
I need more tranquility. Much more.

344
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:25,833
-Will you get me a glass of water, dear?
-Yes, ma'am.

345
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,500
Why do they
only fill these bottles half full?

346
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,500
[pensive music playing]

347
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
[sighs]

348
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:00,875
[fabric ripping]

349
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:05,416
[sighs]

350
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,083
[music intensifies]

351
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,583
-[thud]
-Excuse you, Harmon.

352
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:40,666
Fuck you, Margaret.

353
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:42,458
[Mrs. Wheatley] Beth,

354
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,625
this came for you.

355
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:55,666
Thank you.

356
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,291
Mm-hm.

357
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
[footsteps receding]

358
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:33,166
Tell Alma to go easy.

359
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,500
She's only got three refills left.

360
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:42,791
For a trip the White House
again calls non-political…

361
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:45,708
-[Alma] You're home late.
-…political-looking escort

362
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,375
of 17 Democratic congressmen,
and Mrs. Kennedy…

363
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:51,208
-I was out walking.
-…who was featured at the arrival…

364
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,041
Okay. Good night.

365
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,000
Good night.

366
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,791
…turning on the smile that hasn't been…

367
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,041
[Beth] Oh, um…

368
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:03,250
I'm gonna be late again tomorrow.
I have something after school.

369
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,375
Have you joined a club?

370
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,375
I'm playing in that chess tournament
I told you about.

371
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,000
I won't argue
that broadening one's social life

372
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,125
is important for a girl your age.

373
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:17,958
I just wonder whether a dance class
or a girls' club

374
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:20,166
wouldn't be better for making friendships.

375
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,875
I hear Fairfield has pretty good ones.

376
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,750
When you were my age,
how did you broaden your social life?

377
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,291
The tournament goes until Sunday.

378
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,375
[pensive music playing]

379
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,125
-Do you have a clock?
-No.

380
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:02,333
We have a clock-sharing system.
If your opponent doesn't have one,

381
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:03,958
come back, and we'll loan you one.

382
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,208
Play starts in 20 minutes.

383
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,500
What's your rating?

384
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,375
I don't have a rating.

385
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,875
-Have you played in a tournament before?
-No.

386
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:18,333
-Are you sure you wanna do this?
-I'm sure.

387
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:20,208
We don't have a women's section.

388
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,166
-I'll put you in beginners.
-I'm not a beginner.

389
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,250
[man] Doesn't matter.

390
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,416
If you're an unrated player,

391
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,833
you go in beginners
with the people under 1600.

392
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,083
-What's the prize for beginners?
-Twenty.

393
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:36,875
-What about the other section?
-First prize in the Open is 100.

394
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:39,208
Is it against any rule
for me to be in the Open?

395
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,750
-Not exactly.
-Put me in the Open.

396
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,375
There are three guys in there
with ratings over 1800.

397
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,041
And Beltik may show up.

398
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,833
They will eat you alive.

399
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:55,291
"Harmon."

400
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,458
-[exciting music playing]
-[indistinct conversations]

401
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,875
[music slows pensively]

402
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,666
Are the matches played at random?

403
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,041
Oh, not at all.

404
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:53,416
Uh…

405
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,625
Uh, they arrange it by ratings
on the first round.

406
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,375
After that, winners play winners,
and losers, losers.

407
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:07,916
Good luck.

408
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:10,750
You, too.

409
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:22,875
[man] Hi.

410
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,625
Hi.

411
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,000
-Annette Packer.
-Beth Harmon.

412
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,833
-I don't understand about chess clocks.
-Oh.

413
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,333
Um…

414
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,041
The clock faced nearest you
measures your playing time.

415
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,000
Each player has 90 minutes.

416
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,625
After you move,
you press that button on top,

417
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,750
and it stops your clock
and starts your opponent's.

418
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:52,125
And you see that little red flag
over the number 12 on each clock?

419
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,250
Yours will fall down
when the 90 minutes is up,

420
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,708
and if it does that…

421
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,208
you've lost.

422
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,500
And, um…

423
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,333
For recording your moves.

424
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:03,416
Right. [chuckles]

425
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:12,791
-You can start your clocks now.
-You can start my clock now.

426
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,041
Why do they put the girls together?

427
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,333
They're not supposed to…

428
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,375
but, if you win, they move you up.

429
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,375
-[button clicks]
-[clock ticking]

430
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,583
-[Annette] Oh, it's touch move.
-[Beth] What's that?

431
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,250
Don't touch a piece
unless you're going to move it.

432
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,375
If you touch it,
you have to move it somewhere.

433
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:31,375
Okay.

434
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,000
Don't you push your button now?

435
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:40,416
Sorry.

436
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,000
What I do with this?

437
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,791
Is your match over?

438
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,000
Yes, I won.

439
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:52,708
That was fast.

440
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,250
What do I do with this?

441
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,000
Circle your name
and drop it in the basket.

442
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,875
[gentle orchestral music playing]

443
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:10,708
[chess clock ticking]

444
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,500
-[Beth] Who are they?
-[man whispering] Beltik and Cullen.

445
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,500
-Beltik's the State Champion.
-[in normal voice] Which is which?

446
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:25,125
-[whispering] Beltik's the younger one.
-Is he a Grandmaster?

447
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:26,208
He's working on it.

448
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:27,333
Takes time.

449
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,416
You have to play Grandmasters
to become one.

450
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,625
-[in normal voice] How much time?
-Do you mind?

451
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:40,625
Draw?

452
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:45,083
Hell, no.

453
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,708
Yes!

454
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,125
[applauding]

455
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,666
[pensive music playing]

456
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:34,375
That's check.

457
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,625
I know what it is.

458
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,041
[man clears throat]

459
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,166
Draw?

460
00:39:58,375 --> 00:39:59,208
You got me.

461
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:00,250
I resign.

462
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,083
[water running]

463
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,166
Dinner break.

464
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:31,625
Next round is at six o'clock.
Then, three more tomorrow.

465
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,791
Final round is Sunday, 11 a.m.

466
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:40,708
[man] Harmon?

467
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:42,958
Keep it up, kid.

468
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,125
[man 1 on TV]
I think he knew you killed his brother.

469
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,916
-You're in trouble…
-Yours is in the oven.

470
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,500
[man 2] Someone's always crowding me.

471
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:57,375
-How did you do at your thing?
-I won four games.

472
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,416
That's nice, good for you.

473
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,666
Yes, Harmon?

474
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,583
You said there were three people here
with a rating higher than 1800.

475
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:17,458
-That's right.
-I thought I'd be playing one of them.

476
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,875
Them's the breaks, Harmon.

477
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,166
Consider yourself lucky.

478
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,083
I want to play the best.

479
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,541
You have to get a rating
before that happens.

480
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:25,916
How do I get a rating?

481
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,250
You play 30 games in USCF tournaments,
then wait four months.

482
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:32,250
-That's how you get a rating.
-That's too long.

483
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,166
I want to play Beltik.

484
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,333
If you win your next three games,
and if Beltik does the same.

485
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:38,375
I will win them.

486
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:42,250
No, Harmon, you won't. You have to play
Sizemore or Goldman first.

487
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,625
You can't beat either of them.

488
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:46,125
Sizemore and Goldman? Shit.

489
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,750
Townes, the guy you're playing now,
is underrated.

490
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:51,250
He plays first board
for the university team,

491
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,541
and last month
he came in fifth in Las Vegas.

492
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:56,583
[snickers]

493
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,166
What's in Las Vegas?

494
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:04,833
The US Open.

495
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,958
[pensive music playing]

496
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,333
Looks like we've been stalking each other.

497
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,333
You want to start my clock?

498
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:43,500
[chuckles softly]

499
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,333
Sorry.

500

-[button clicks]
-[clock ticking]

501
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:17,791
-[chess pieces clattering]
-[chess clock button clicking]

502
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,583
Jesus Christ, Harmon,
you're humiliating my rook.

503
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,041
He won't have to suffer much longer.

504
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,833
Damn.

505
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:05,458
How old are you?

506
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:07,250
Never mind.

507
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:10,583
-Don't answer that, it'll just depress me.
-I'm 36.

508
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:11,583
[chuckles]

509
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:13,000
Thank you.

510
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:17,250
You really are something, you know that?

511
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,833
Shall we turn in our sheets?

512
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,416
Um… you go ahead.

513
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,291
I'm gonna study the board a little longer.

514
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:33,250
Wow.

515
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,333
[groans softly]

516
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:50,833
[whispering] Damn it!

517
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,833
[cries out] Damn!

518
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:02,291
[bathroom door opens]

519
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,666
[Annette] I just wanted to tell you
that I've never seen anything like…

520
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:08,333
Um…

521
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:09,958
Do-- Do you have something?

522
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,500
It's my first time.

523
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:15,958
Um…

524
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:20,750
Do you know how to use it?

525
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:23,791
I think so.

526
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,583
I'll wait, just in case.

527
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:30,041
[bathroom stall locks]

528
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,083
[Annette] You're, uh…

529
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,083
You're moving right on up, aren't you?

530
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,166
So far.

531
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,208
Sizemore's pretty tough, though.

532
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:43,291
[Beth] Uh-huh.

533
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:50,041
[lock slides open]

534
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:58,791
[water running]

535
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:02,958
Thank you.

536
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:05,541
I didn't…

537
00:47:06,916 --> 00:47:07,791
I just thought…

538
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:11,958
Thought I was sick.

539
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,208
My first time, I threw up.

540
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,625
Well, I still do sometimes.

541
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:21,791
Actually, every time.

542
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:26,833
Well, I have to get back.

543
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:27,750
Oh, sure.

544
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:30,791
Hey, Beth.

545
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,416
Beat him, will you?

546
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:35,458
I'll try.

547
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:49,083
[Sizemore clears throat] Ready?

[gentle music playing on piano]

552
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,791
I've started menstruating.

553
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,250
Bit late in the day for you, isn't it?

554
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:32,791
I'll need pads…

555
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,416
something.

556
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,125
Just go up to my room,
to the top drawer of my chiffonier,

557
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:39,583
and take what you require.

558
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:43,916
Oh, and, dear…

559
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:49,416
be a good girl and get that little bottle
of green pills by my bedside.

560
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:54,291
My tranquility needs to be refurbished.

561
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,666
[muffled busy signal through phone]

562
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,291
Thank you.

563
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:43,500
Is something wrong?

564
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:46,625
Wrong?

565
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:48,166
[sarcastic chuckle]

566
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:50,375
I'm not Aristotle, but yes,

567
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,708
I think something
could be construed as wrong.

568
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:57,333
I've received a message from Mr. Wheatley.

569
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:00,541
What did he say?

570
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,375
It seems Mr. Wheatley…

571
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:08,333
has been indefinitely detained
in the Southwest.

572
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,333
Somewhere between Denver and Butte.

573
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:20,416
Though, Aristotle was a moral philosopher,
and I'm just a housewife.

574
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:23,666
Or I was a housewife.

575
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:30,916
Can they send me back
if you no longer have a husband?

576
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:36,875
You put it concretely.

577
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,875
They won't if we lie about it.

578
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:49,166
That's easy enough.

579
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,458
You're a good soul, Beth.
[sniffles]

580
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:04,416
Why don't you heat up the chicken dinners
in the freezer, okay?

581
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:07,666
Set the oven at 400.

582
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:12,375
I don't know how to put these on.

583
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:22,958
Though I'm no longer a wife,

584
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:25,583
except by a legal fiction…

585
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,708
I believe I can learn to be a mother.

586
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:38,791
I'll show you how…

587
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,583
if you promise to never go near Denver.

588
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,750
[clock ticking]

589
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:15,750
[young Beth] Mama?

590
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:23,958
[Alice] Close your eyes.

[door closes]

594
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:07,000
[man] Sorry.

595
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,458
Extra cup of coffee.

596
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:10,833
[slurps]

597
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,750
Harry Beltik. What's your name?

598
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:17,000
Beth Harmon.

599
00:53:56,541 --> 00:53:57,958
[yawns]

600
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:34,458
[Beltik yawns]

-[chess pieces clatter]
-[chess clock button clicks]

602
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:50,250
[Beth] Be right back.

603
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:12,083
Come on, you ugly piece of trash.

604
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:14,666
You can beat that…

605
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:17,750
fucker.

606
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
[sniffs, sighs]

607
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,250
[uneasy music playing]

608
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,958
[tense music playing]

609
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:48,625
-Son of a bitch.
-I think that's it.

610
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:51,208
-No, I can get out of this.
-I don't think so.

611
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:55,250
Maybe, if you'd gotten here on time.

612
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,833
It doesn't work.

613
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:09,666
-I don't have to use the queen.
-Move.

614
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,833
-I'll just cover it with the bishop and--
-Move.

615
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:48,000
[Beth] Do you see it now?

616
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,166
Or should we finish this on the board?

617
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:57,916
Son of a bitch.

618
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,041
[onlookers applauding]

619

[Alma] "The world of Kentucky
chess was astonished this weekend

620
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:19,583
by the playing of a local girl
who triumphed over hardened players

621
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:22,125
to win the Kentucky State Championship."

622
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:26,666
"Elizabeth Harmon,
a student at Fairfield High,

623
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:30,291
showed a mastery of the game
unequaled by any female,

624
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:32,000
according to Harry Beltik,

625
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:34,416
whom Miss Harmon defeated
for the state crown."

626
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:37,750
And 100 dollars.

627
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:40,250
You won this.

628
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:41,916
I wanna open a bank account.

629
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:45,791
But you have to go with me,
because I need a parent or a guardian.

630
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:49,708
I just didn't have the faintest idea
that people made money playing chess.

631
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:52,250
There's tournaments
with bigger prizes than that.

632
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:55,416
How much bigger?

633
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:58,625
Thousands of dollars.

634
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:00,541
Goodness.

635
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,875
So, can we go
to the bank today after school?

636
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,833
Certainly.

Beth, will you come down here, please?

640
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:15,208
What's wrong?

641
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,375
I've been leafing
through this chess magazine.

642
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:19,916
It's very interesting.

643
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,500
It says here that there is
a tournament in Cincinnati,

644
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,916
and the first prize is 500 dollars.

645
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:31,708
The Greyhound bus
only requires two hours for the trip.

646
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:34,208
I took the liberty of calling.

647
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:38,708
What about school?

648
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:42,333
I could write a medical excuse
claiming mono.

649
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:43,333
Mono?

650
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:44,458
Mononucleosis.

651
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:48,125
It's quite the thing in your age group,
according to the Ladies Home Journal.

652
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,541
Where would we stay?

653
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:56,666
At the Gibson Hotel, in a double room
for 22 dollars a night.

654
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:01,041
The Greyhound tickets
would be $11.80 apiece,

655
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:03,166
plus the cost of food.

656
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,791
I've calculated all of it.

657
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:08,125
Even if you only won
second or third prize,

658
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:10,333
there would still be a profit.

659
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:12,708
I'll win.

660
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,375
I have every confidence.
