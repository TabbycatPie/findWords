1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,760
Netflix are a real bunch of cunts,
aren't they?

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,000
I would love for them to play that.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,680
They're not gonna play that.

4
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,676
[Michael] <i>All right, let me get a coffee.</i>

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,760
- [Daniel] I'm gonna do a bit of a squat.
- What do you want, an espresso?

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,100
[Daniel] Yeah.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,040
[Daniel] <i>Last year, I took a gamble
and switched teams.</i>

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,000
<i>Everyone was like,
"Why are you leaving Red Bull?"</i>

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>A lot of people asking questions.</i>

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,460
- [Michael] You know that expression...
- Go fuck yourself. That one?

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,960
[Daniel] <i>Obviously,
I spoke to a few teams.</i>

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,160
<i>There was definitely talks with McLaren.</i>

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,560
[driver] Fucking stupid.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Unbelievable.

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,760
[Daniel] <i>But I guess the truth is</i>

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,900
<i>I hadn't seen enough to convince me
that it was gonna get better.</i>

17
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,720
[Daniel] <i>With Renault, I saw the momentum
they've had since 2016.</i>

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,820
<i>And they've had a really strong 2018.</i>

19
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,020
<i>That was a big attraction for me.</i>

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,760
<i>I looked at their plan</i>

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,280
<i>and when I kind of had everything
on the table in front of me,</i>

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,460
<i>the Renault one encouraged me
and convinced me more.</i>

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,200
<i>I took a chance.</i>

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,040
<i>But also, they made a big gamble
signing me.</i>

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,760
[engine revving]

26
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,480
[indistinct chatter]

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
[woman in Spanish]
Carlos, would you like some ham?

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,080
Do we all want gazpacho?

29
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,620
Yeah.

30
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,540
- Would anyone like wine?
- [man] I want some.

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,720
[Carlos in English] <i>I've been coming
to Mallorca since I'm zero years old.</i>

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,220
[woman] How awesome.

33
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,480
<i>It's very Spanish way
just to spend summer break</i>

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,920
<i>with your cousins, with your uncles,
grandparents, your sisters, your family.</i>

35
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,680
[laughing]

36
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,600
<i>Here, everyone is totally relaxed.</i>

37
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,340
[man in Spanish] It's very good, folks.

38
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,920
- How do you like it, Auntie Carmen?
- Very good.

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,960
It's definitely very good.

40
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,280
[Carlos in English] <i>Every professional
athlete needs their own time,</i>

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,580
<i>where you can actually relax a bit
and disconnect from the outside world,</i>

42
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,880
<i>and work, basically.</i>

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,100
But 2018 summer was a bit different.

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,540
[man in Spanish] Come on!

45
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,540
2018 was a bit of a weird season
for Carlos 'cause he...

46
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,300
<i>drove for Renault.</i>

47
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,960
By June, July, all the silly season
starts with a driver's market.

48
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,740
[announcer] <i>And the knock-on effects
of Ricciardo moving to Renault</i>

49
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,180
<i>mean Carlos Sainz will lose his seat.</i>

50
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,000
- [man 1] See ya.
- [woman] Bye.

51
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
[man 2] Bye.

52
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,780
[Caco] <i>We got a call from Cyril saying,
"Look, we just signed Ricciardo.</i>

53
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,980
That leaves you out of the team."

54
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,300
[in Spanish] Where do we find more fish?

55
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,280
In or out of the platform?

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,420
I think the inside area.

57
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,000
[in English] I was hurt that the Renault
car that I had been driving that year,

58
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,680
it was so easily taken by someone else.

59
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,880
[Caco] <i>We didn't really know
what was gonna happen in the future.</i>

60
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,200
[Caco in Spanish] I'm ready.

61
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,800
[Carlos in English] <i>My main scare
was not staying in Renault,</i>

62
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,720
it was staying in Formula 1.

63
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,940
<i>For me, it was 100% like,</i>

64
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,700
"I need to have a seat.
I will have a seat."

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,380
[Caco] <i>It was quite intense
'cause we were always on the phone,</i>

66
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,220
always on the email,
speaking to all the teams.

67
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,180
[Carlos in Spanish] I'm not going to fail.

68
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,200
[Caco in English] <i>But then, suddenly,
things started to fall in place.</i>

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,620
Why not take the challenge and go for it?

70
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,700
[Caco in Spanish] Well done.

71
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160
[Carlos] Great. Now we have one.

72
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,420
[announcer in English] <i>Three, two, one.</i>

73
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,500
[announcer] <i>Big thanks
to the new driver line-up for McLaren.</i>

74
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,520
[all clapping]

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,740
[Carlos] It's a great honor to be here.

76
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,600
It's something special,
so I really want to thank everyone.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,180
[Zak] <i>We got to know
Carlos moved very quick</i>

78
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,640
and very happy to have him
as a McLaren Grand Prix driver.

79
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,680
[Zak] Everyone in here
works unbelievably hard.

80
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,900
Everyone has contributed to this race car.

81
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,460
Collectively, us, as a group,
we're gonna all get back to where

82
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,700
I know we should be, can be,
and have been.

83
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,380
And I hope to do it soon.

84
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,000
[Zak] <i>2018, I don't think
we designed a very good race car.</i>

85
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,360
[man] <i>We are out of the points.</i>

86
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,740
[Zak] <i>So, by the end of the year,</i>

87
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,400
<i>we were about
the eighth, ninth quickest team.</i>

88
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,980
[man] Fucking stupid.

89
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,060
[announcer] <i>Not another problem
for McLaren!</i>

90
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,640
[Zak] <i>We wouldn't have put Carlos
in our race car</i>

91
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,620
<i>if we didn't think he was extremely fast.</i>

92
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,440
So, even though he was only 24 years old,
he's done a lot of Grand Prix,

93
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,040
<i>and so he's got a great blend
of youth and aggression,</i>

94
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,240
<i>but yet, you know, mature.</i>

95
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,340
That's what we really need
to get back to winning races.

96
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
[Zak] Hey, guys.

97
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,880
Where are we going?
Down or are we walkin' around?

98
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,176
- [woman] Straight down.
- [Zak] Straight around?

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
[woman] Yeah.

100
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,480
What did you guys do
in the Renault launch last year?

101
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,920
[Carlos] It was nothing special.

102
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,820
Nothing too...

103
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,140
[mutters] Not what you expect?

104
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,520
To be honest, no.

105
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,300
- Not as much...
- No.

106
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,480
...fanfare?

107
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
Definitely not.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,960
- Looks good.
- It looks really good.

109
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,740
[Zak] Get me one of those. I'll take two!

110
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,780
[Carlos] Yeah.

111
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,420
It's year by year?

112
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,580
Yeah, by year, yeah.

113
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,220
[Carlos] <i>It's unbelievable.</i>

114
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,720
<i>The first time I went there,</i>

115
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,920
<i>the first thing that came to mind was
how these guys cannot be winning.</i>

116
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,100
McLaren last year, they had probably
one of their worst seasons in Formula 1,

117
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,400
if not the worst.

118
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,700
Hey, guys.

119
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,720
Shall I practice my entrance
like yesterday?

120
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,960
[man] The Ronaldo one?

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,120
[woman] Do the run and jump.

122
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,680
There's the car.

123
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,640
[laughing]

124
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,420
[Zak] <i>Our goals for 2019 have to be
to take a step forward.</i>

125
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,320
We had to make a lot of changes,
which we did.

126
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,800
<i>You know, now we've got two great drivers
in Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris.</i>

127
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,000
<i>And he gets along with Lando very well.</i>

128
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,140
They're very competitive with each other,
but in a healthy way.

129
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,960
High-five everyone, please.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,556
- Please high-five everyone.
- [Lando] Imagine if I get left hanging.

131
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,676
- Mic check.
- That would be a good start

132
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,440
to our season together.

133
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,940
[Lando] I'm not ready.

134
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,840
My heart has started beating.

135
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,340
[woman] Shall we do a picture?

136
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,180
It's a big risk for Carlos,
moving to McLaren...

137
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,660
and not just because
of McLaren's recent troubles.

138
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,080
<i>If he can rebuild that team,</i>

139
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,400
<i>I think it would do his reputation good.</i>

140
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,220
<i>But if it doesn't work out for him,</i>

141
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,840
he could get buried
by the entire experience.

142
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,080
[man] Ready in 30 seconds.

143
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,620
[Carlos] <i>You always have doubts.</i>

144
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,920
<i>You wonder, "Well, what if McLaren
are still 17th, 16th fastest?</i>

145
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,260
What's gonna happen with me?"

146
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,600
People are gonna start
forgetting about me.

147
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,860
[man] Ten, nine, eight,

148
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,220
seven...

149
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,620
[Carlos] <i>But for me,
a new year is a new start.</i>

150
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,980
Then really try to forget
about the doubts.

151
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,660
[all clapping]

152
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,120
[commentator] <i>On the shores
of the Caspian Sea</i>

153
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,240
<i>are the streets of Baku,
the capital of Azerbaijan</i>

154
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,960
<i>and round four of the Formula 1
World Championship of 2019.</i>

155
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,820
[Carlos] I'm trying to smile.

156
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
Show positivity.

157
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,120
- [woman] Radiate positivity.
- Radiate positivity.

158
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,216
[Zak] <i>Well, I think, you know,
Carlos's first couple of races,</i>

159
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,640
<i>he's had... bad luck.</i>

160
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,760
The results have been a mixed bag.

161
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,000
Tonight, we'll be celebrating, 100%.

162
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Hey, guys.

163
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,260
[Lando] Nothing happened.

164
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,720
If you get a podium, will you jump in?

165
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,460
[Carlos] If I get a podium,
I don't know what I'd do.

166
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,560
<i>Actually, it's time to turn things around,</i>

167
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,780
even if it hasn't been my fault,

168
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,920
just make it happen, you know,
just whatever I need to do, just do it.

169
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,840
[Daniel] All right.

170
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,080
Which way is it?

171
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,720
[crowd exclaiming] Daniel! Whoo!

172
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,960
[woman] I love you!

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,940
[Daniel] <i>I love coming here.</i>

174
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,080
[woman] Thank you!

175
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,840
[Daniel] <i>Baku is a high-speed
street circuit.</i>

176
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,780
[announcer] <i>Danny Ricciardo!</i>

177
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,300
This track creates just amazing racing.
It's so intense.

178
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,260
<i>But, really, with Renault,</i>

179
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,620
<i>so far in the season,
we haven't achieved what we wanted to.</i>

180
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,300
This season has been probably
the most challenging...

181
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,320
<i>experience in my career so far.</i>

182
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,596
[commentator] <i>And Daniel Ricciardo,
losing his front wing going into turn one.</i>

183
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,940
[Daniel] Everything just cut out.

184
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,780
[Cyril] Every single race weekend,
something happened to us

185
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,980
<i>which had a negative impact
on the results.</i>

186
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,860
[commentator] <i>Daniel Ricciardo's Renault
career hasn't started that well, has it?</i>

187
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,800
- Pidges?
- Do your pidges and your thoracics.

188
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,980
First couple of races this season
were, you know...

189
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,160
not the way I wanted to start,
you know, my account with Renault.

190
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,440
[Michael] Get some speed.
Get into appropriate intensity.

191
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,940
Nice, mate.

192
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,340
[Will] <i>Moving teams is always tricky,</i>

193
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,720
particularly when they've spent
so much of their career in one place.

194
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,060
<i>I think Daniel knew that moving to Renault
would prove to be a challenge.</i>

195
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,960
<i>But I don't think he anticipated</i>

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,980
these early races
would be as hard as they've been.

197
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,056
[commentator] <i>It's time for Qualifying.</i>

198
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,640
<i>An hour of flat-out driving
on the streets of Baku.</i>

199
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,380
[Simon] Okay, at the moment,
you're clear from traffic behind.

200
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,420
[Daniel] Okay.

201
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,660
[commentator] <i>This is it.
He's got one lap to shine.</i>

202
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
[Daniel] How're we looking?

203
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,480
[Simon] You're currently P11,
five hundredths from Norris.

204
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,620
[Daniel] <i>I'm still not there yet
with this car.</i>

205
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,900
<i>Everything is different to the Red Bull.</i>

206
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,380
<i>The brakes, the throttle,
the feeling on the pedal.</i>

207
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,420
<i>It's everything.</i>

208
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,920
<i>All that being said,
it's still a race car.</i>

209
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,780
<i>You can drive it,
still nearly with your eyes closed.</i>

210
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,520
<i>But to drive it on the limit</i>

211
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,860
<i>and to really gel with
and understand the car,</i>

212
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,180
<i>that then takes a bit more time.</i>

213
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,320
[commentator] <i>Ricciardo crosses the line.</i>

214
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,400
<i>And it says 12th fastest.</i>

215
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,920
<i>Slowest of the 12 drivers
that we have had so far.</i>

216
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,080
[Simon] You're P12.

217
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,080
[Daniel] <i>Sorry, I lost the rear
quite early in the lap.</i>

218
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,620
[commentator] <i>Ricciardo doesn't seem as
confident on the brakes of a Renault yet</i>

219
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,000
<i>as he did in a Red Bull.</i>

220
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,380
[Will] <i>Daniel Ricciardo's
one of the best drivers in Formula 1</i>

221
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,960
and a proven race-winner.

222
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,900
<i>But that's not a silver bullet</i>

223
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,100
for a car that in and of itself doesn't
have the capability of winning races.

224
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,600
I still know
I can get a lot more out of it.

225
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,380
There's still some areas I can improve on.

226
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
For sure.

227
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,440
[commentator] <i>Here's Carlos Sainz,</i>

228
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,200
<i>still yet to score a point for McLaren
so far this season</i>

229
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,840
<i>and looking a bit on the back foot
coming into this qualifying session.</i>

230
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,900
[Carlos] <i>I think it's one of those
situations in this sport</i>

231
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,240
where you're comfortable,
you're feeling great at the wheel,

232
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,780
<i>but there's just one final thing,
which is a result.</i>

233
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,560
[Tom] Okay, Carlos, you are currently P12.

234
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,080
It's not a good lap.

235
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,760
[Zak] <i>Even though we knew
Carlos was very quick,</i>

236
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,440
anytime a new driver gets into your car,
they need to prove themselves.

237
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,920
[Tom] Okay, mate, we finished P11.

238
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,040
For fuck's sake.

239
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,980
Fuck.

240
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,080
So frustrating.

241
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,020
It's so fucking frustrating.

242
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,120
[Will] <i>You know, some drivers move
to teams and they excel,</i>

243
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,856
<i>and then you see them
sometimes move to teams</i>

244
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,920
and then fall short of expectations.

245
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,680
[Carlos in Spanish] Bad luck, man. Shit.

246
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,480
- [man in English]<i> Thank you.</i>
- [Daniel]<i> Thanks. No worries.</i>

247
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,820
Ricciardo, I thought that was not...

248
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,420
I think that qualifying session
was not good.

249
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,720
Yeah, you should've thrown
some banana peels at my rivals.

250
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Yeah!

251
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Totally.

252
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
[Daniel] <i>It's nearly a year
since I had a podium.</i>

253
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,080
<i>And it feels like it's been a while.</i>

254
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,440
<i>I felt like my best
was good enough for 12th place.</i>

255
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,360
<i>It's obviously not where we wanna be,
but Baku is crazy.</i>

256
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,740
<i>Anything can happen.</i>

257
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,240
<i>I've had massive highs and lows here.</i>

258
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,920
<i>2018 was one of the big kind of
controversial moments of that season.</i>

259
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,080
[all clapping]

260
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,800
<i>2017, I won the race.</i>

261
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,040
<i>So, I've certainly had
all sorts of emotions here.</i>

262
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,920
<i>Hopefully my experience pays off tomorrow.</i>

263
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,780
[commentator] <i>Daniel Ricciardo,
he is the lead Renault now</i>

264
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,560
<i>and having a better day of it.</i>

265
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,580
Yes.

266
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
[man] Nice job.

267
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,920
[Simon] P10.

268
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
[exclaims]

269
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,940
[commentator] <i>Now here comes one McLaren
on another, Carlos Sainz on Lando Norris.</i>

270
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,920
<i>Sainz is now the lead McLaren.</i>

271
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,276
[commentator] <i>Pace is looking very strong.</i>

272
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,460
<i>Get Magnussen out.</i>

273
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,540
[Daniel] Nice one, mate.

274
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,740
[Simon] Okay,
next car on the road is Kvyat.

275
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,180
3.5 ahead.

276
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,280
[commentator] <i>Daniel Ricciardo
has got himself up to eighth.</i>

277
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,940
[Simon] <i>Four tenths
quicker than Kvyat ahead.</i>

278
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,240
[Simon] You gained nine tenths on Kvyat
that last lap.

279
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,580
You have overtake available.

280
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,200
And you get DRS on Kvyat now.

281
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,320
[Daniel] Understood.

282
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,720
[commentator] <i>Here comes Ricciardo,
king of the late brakers.</i>

283
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,400
<i>Can he do it to Kvyat?</i>

284
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
<i>No! He's off!</i>

285
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,620
[Simon] No.

286
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,080
[commentator] <i>This is costing him
a lot of time.</i>

287
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,080
[commentator] <i>And he's... Oh!</i>

288
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,100
<i>He's just reversed into Kvyat.</i>

289
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,680
<i>Things go from bad to worse
for the unlucky Renault team.</i>

290
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,800
[Daniel] I didn't see him.

291
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,520
[engine revving]

292
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,640
Something feels loose.

293
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,100
I'm gonna box.

294
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,320
[commentator] <i>Ricciardo's gonna
have to retire, I think, from this race.</i>

295
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,240
[Simon] Switching off.
Switching off, please.

296
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,440
[Daniel] Sorry, guys.

297
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,600
[engine revving]

298
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,440
[Tom] <i>Okay, Carlos,
that's Grosjean in front.</i>

299
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,680
<i>So, Carlos, this is good so far.
This is good.</i>

300
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,800
<i>You're P7, there's two laps to go.</i>

301
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,540
<i>And this will be the last lap.</i>

302
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,940
<i>That's the chequered flag. Well done. P7.</i>

303
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,300
[Eric] <i>Come on, boys! Yes!</i>

304
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,380
Finally off the mark.

305
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
[in Spanish] Good.

306
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,360
- About time.
- About fucking time.

307
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,060
[Caco in Spanish] Long time.

308
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,860
First points of the year for him.

309
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,780
<i>Seventh was a good result.</i>

310
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,316
Yeah, the feeling was a bit of relief.

311
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,620
[Caco in Spanish] Solid, man, very solid.

312
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,316
[woman in English] Yeah.
It always felt like a long time coming.

313
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,360
[laughs]

314
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,516
[Zak] That was good, better.

315
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,420
Needed that.

316
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,460
Good work, guys.

317
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,936
- [in Spanish] How are you?
- [in Spanish] Good.

318
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,640
[Carlos] <i>Baku was exactly what I needed.</i>

319
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,080
A bit of a good result, you know,
to get my system going.

320
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,500
[man] Smile.

321
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,840
[all laugh]

322
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,316
[Carlos] <i>And a bit of a relief that...</i>

323
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,680
"Bad luck" you call it?

324
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,080
I call it "things not going towards me"
ended there.

325
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,380
Unlucky, mate.

326
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,640
[Daniel] <i>Obviously, I feel embarrassed
and I feel like an idiot.</i>

327
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,260
<i>I felt like
I had a bit of a responsibility</i>

328
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,900
<i>to give everyone a smile Sunday night.</i>

329
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,620
<i>And it just turned into shit, basically.</i>

330
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,180
<i>I'm feeling like the smallest guy
in the whole of F1, so, yeah.</i>

331
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,040
To be honest, as soon as I went off,
I just was like, "Reverse!"

332
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,280
Do a circle, no?

333
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,840
No, I didn't see him.

334
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,200
I didn't think...

335
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,220
[Cyril] <i>I think he gave himself just
one lap to overtake him</i>

336
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,600
<i>and made a bit of a brave maneuver,
which didn't work.</i>

337
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,580
So, frankly, it was
another embarrassing moment for Daniel,

338
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,620
but for the whole team.

339
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,260
[Daniel] <i>This sport definitely still has
the ability to rip your heart out</i>

340
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,560
<i>from one day to the next.</i>

341
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,260
<i>And this year, it has for me.</i>

342
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,680
<i>Living with your mistakes,
that's a tough one.</i>

343
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,276
<i>That's why you've sometimes
got to look at it</i>

344
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,460
<i>from a different perspective.</i>

345
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,520
<i>That's why I choose to come here,</i>

346
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,120
<i>spend some time staring at palm trees
and blue skies to reset my focus.</i>

347
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,700
It's like 33 degrees today,
so get some sun, play a bit of basketball.

348
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,260
The basketball's in here, right?

349
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,760
How's your game gonna be today?

350
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
I don't know, mate.
This would start me off strong.

351
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,960
- [both laughing]
- Shit!

352
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,160
He's on today.

353
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,500
[laughs]

354
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,120
[Daniel] <i>With Michael,
we have a good relationship.</i>

355
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,040
Kobe.

356
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,680
<i>Trainer, performance coach,
whatever the title is.</i>

357
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,080
- Sink that long one.
- [both exclaim]

358
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,200
I'll go a bit closer.
Try to get my confidence up.

359
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
[Daniel] That's it.

360
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,656
<i>It's definitely
not just physical training, you know?</i>

361
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,760
<i>And you need a friend
because we travel so much together.</i>

362
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,056
<i>Someone you can really open up to,</i>

363
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,540
<i>someone who's happy to hear my shit
after a long week.</i>

364
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
[Daniel] Feed me.

365
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,400
[Michael] <i>We met, I think,
when we were around 11 years old.</i>

366
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,500
And we've been friends ever since.

367
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,180
[Michael] Let's go do a bit of a stretch.

368
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
See if you can touch.

369
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,160
Just forget the camel toe here.

370
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,936
[Michael] <i>Daniel is obviously a joker.</i>

371
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,036
- You're way off. You're touching nothing.
- I can feel something on my bum.

372
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,300
[Michael] Yeah, it's not the ground.

373
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,400
<i>But there also is Daniel Ricciardo,
the racer.</i>

374
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,320
He is definitely a serious competitor.

375
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,400
Loosen up those hips.

376
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,180
<i>It's extremely important
to be in the right head space</i>

377
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,360
<i>when you jump in that car,
so the psychological factor's huge.</i>

378
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,100
It makes a big difference
come race day, for sure.

379
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,720
[Daniel] <i>The whole Red Bull thing,
I discussed the move with Michael.</i>

380
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,220
<i>The choice, looking at McLaren,</i>

381
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,860
<i>and I'm not bitter towards,
you know, McLaren for doing well</i>

382
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,100
<i>because it was my decision.</i>

383
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,880
McLaren look quick, mate.

384
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,820
Carlos is just...

385
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,480
He's been good.

386
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,660
Cheers, cunt.

387
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,840
I feel like we've been quite unlucky,
but it is what it is.

388
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,880
Yeah.

389
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,940
Yes, I'm angry at myself,
'cause I'm always like, "I can do better."

390
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,160
Mate, there's no point dwelling on it.

391
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,076
I think your attitude's been good, mate.

392
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,600
You've just been fierce,
you've been competitive.

393
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,720
Take it as it is
and just keep working, keep building.

394
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,300
Try to build some more points
in Barcelona.

395
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,640
Yeah, exactly.

396
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,880
I know it's not gonna last.

397
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
[Michael] Yeah.

398
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,016
- [Rupert] There he is.
- [Carlos] Good morning.

399
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,876
[Rupert] All right, mate?
How are you? All good?

400
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,640
- [Carlos] Good. You?
- Yeah, good.

401
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,200
Is the bell still not working
or are you just ignoring me?

402
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,220
[Carlos] It's going to rain, yeah?

403
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,400
It could rain.

404
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,356
It's pretty much been doing that nonstop
the last few days.

405
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,380
- When is Sam coming?
- Welcome to the UK.

406
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,880
Thank you.

407
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,740
[Carlos] <i>Moving to the UK was...
it was a bit of challenging myself.</i>

408
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,560
It is probably the toughest of the things

409
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,080
to leave family, friends,
girlfriend behind.

410
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,440
[Carlos] We go for chicken fajitas?

411
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
It's cold.

412
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,800
<i>I knew McLaren
was gonna need me in the UK.</i>

413
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,900
We had a lot of work to do.

414
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,700
Who is doing the guacamole?

415
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,076
[Rupert] I'm doing the guacamole, mate.

416
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,836
[Carlos] You know for guacamole,
you need lime.

417
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,920
Ready?

418
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,380
Where's the fajita mix? It's not here.

419
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,920
I'm gonna be depressed.

420
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,380
It has to be here.

421
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,360
Excuse me, do you have
special fajita sauce, El Paso style?

422
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,580
He's really keen on.

423
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,300
- [Rupert] Here we go, mate.
- You have it?

424
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,140
I'm sorry to break this to you.
They might only have their own brand.

425
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,860
No. Then we need to go somewhere else.

426
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,956
Thank you very much. Nice to meet you.

427
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,980
[woman] And you.

428
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,320
[Rupert] It's not hard
to find the car, is it?

429
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,120
[Carlos] No.

430
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,800
[Rupert] Where does the shopping go?

431
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,880
Where is the fucking boot?

432
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,860
You must have a smaller bag, no?

433
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,040
You carry it. Come on.

434
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,640
[Rupert] It's my job, right?

435
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,700
[Carlos] Morning.

436
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,420
- [man] All right, mate?
- Yeah, good, you?

437
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,640
[Carlos] How many people
are attending the performance review?

438
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,680
<i>Many drivers have asked me,</i>

439
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,300
"Why do you spend so much time in McLaren?
Are you forced to go there?"

440
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,296
The way I apply the brake pressure.

441
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,180
[man] Yes.

442
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,880
A little smooth application
instead of being a bit more punchy.

443
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,716
[Carlos] <i>People underestimate
the relationship with the engineers,</i>

444
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,760
how important it is.

445
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,880
Yeah, we're going just now.

446
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,000
Thank you, mate.

447
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,420
[all chuckling]

448
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,640
It will show itself on track
and then it will pay off.

449
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,360
[Carlos] <i>Hola.</i>

450
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,440
- All right, mate?
- All good?

451
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,080
- Good.
- How's it going? All right?

452
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,000
[Rupert] Does that feel too tight?

453
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,160
Monday to Fridays in the UK,
I'm sleeping well, eating well,

454
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,680
<i>training, dieting
and I need to focus a lot in that.</i>

455
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
[Rupert] And again.

456
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,960
<i>As a coach, you're trying to
take them out of their comfort zone</i>

457
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,600
<i>to basically ensure
that when they need to get in the car,</i>

458
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,820
<i>that they can perform at their best.</i>

459
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,200
Carlos is always really looking
at ways that he can improve himself.

460
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,320
[Carlos] <i>That will give me the confidence
to go to a Formula 1 track.</i>

461
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,440
[Rupert] Slow it back down.

462
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,440
<i>Knowing that I'm working
more than anyone else in Formula 1.</i>

463
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,296
[commentator] <i>In the battle
for king of the midfield,</i>

464
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,920
<i>McLaren now have a surprise lead
over troubled Renault.</i>

465
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,940
- [Michael] Get in the zone, mate.
- [Daniel] Yep.

466
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,616
[Michael] You ready
for a bit of a dogfight?

467
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,900
[Daniel] Good man, fuckin'...

468
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,100
[Michael] Good, man, fucking right.
So am I.

469
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,720
All right, let's do it.

470
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,440
[Daniel] <i>As far as, you know,
our midfield battle goes,</i>

471
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,760
<i>Carlos has been a bit luckier at times.</i>

472
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,560
<i>So, that creates
a bit more tension in the rivalry.</i>

473
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,360
<i>I put a lot into this</i>

474
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,520
and I don't travel around the world
and work this hard

475
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,660
to, you know, not see the chequered flag.

476
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,076
[Daniel] <i>This is my moment to really
go out, when those lights go out,</i>

477
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,640
<i>and be as good as I can be.</i>

478
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
<i>Let's race hard.</i>

479
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,640
<i>May the best man win.</i>

480
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,260
[Carlos] <i>My period in Renault
is totally closed</i>

481
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,640
<i>and I don't see that yellow car as my car
and someone else driving it.</i>

482
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,980
<i>I want to prove to McLaren and Renault</i>

483
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,220
that, of the midfield,
I am the strongest driver.

484
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,060
<i>I don't think anyone is better than me,
but Daniel thinks he's the best.</i>

485
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,380
<i>We all think we are the best.</i>

486
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
<i>Out of all these battles
that are happening here,</i>

487
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,520
I want to be on top.

488
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,480
[Tom] Okay, Carlos, radio check.

489
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,500
[Carlos] <i>Yeah, radio's good.</i>

490
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,860
[Tom] <i>Copy, that's loud and clear.</i>

491
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,580
[Simon] <i>Radio check. Radio check.</i>

492
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,100
[Daniel] Let's fucking have it, boys.

493
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,920
[Cyril] Let's go for it, Daniel.

494
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
[announcer] <i>Ten seconds.</i>

495
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,000
- [crowd murmuring]
- [engines revving]

496
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,940
[commentator] <i>We're racing in Barcelona.</i>

497
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,920
<i>Daniel Ricciardo off to a good start.</i>

498
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,900
<i>Sainz keeping out of trouble
into turn one.</i>

499
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,280
[Tom] <i>Good, Carlos. Good job.</i>

500
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,160
<i>Pace is okay. Pace is okay.</i>

501
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,100
<i>Ricciardo looks quick.</i>

502
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,400
<i>Keep him behind if you can.</i>

503
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,900
[Simon] <i>Carlos is struggling on pace
at the moment.</i>

504
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,800
[Daniel]<i> Okay, they've
definitely got more speed.</i>

505
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,740
[commentator] <i>Ricciardo trying to
get past Carlos Sainz.</i>

506
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,860
<i>Sainz moves to the inside
to cover off Ricciardo.</i>

507
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,720
<i>He knew an attack was coming there.</i>

508
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,936
[Tom] <i>Good, Carlos, good job defending.</i>

509
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,920
<i>Try and keep him behinid.</i>

510
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,540
[Carlos] <i>I'm trying. I'm trying.</i>

511
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,660
[Simon] <i>Gained nine tenths on Carlos
in that last lap.</i>

512
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,740
<i>So, overtake is available.</i>

513
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,040
[Daniel] <i>Understood.</i>

514
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,276
[commentator] <i>Ricciardo is squeezing
everything out of the Renault now</i>

515
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,360
<i>to try and get past Carlos Sainz.</i>

516
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,920
<i>That's Ricciardo through!</i>

517
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,640
[Carlos] <i>Fuck me.</i>

518
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,960
[commentator] <i>Renault have
overtaken McLaren.</i>

519
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,060
[Simon] <i>Nice one, mate.
You're doing a good job, mate.</i>

520
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,280
[Daniel] Okay. I'll box this lap.

521
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,500
[Simon] <i>Okay, understood. Boxing.</i>

522
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,640
[Tom] <i>Box now. Box now.</i>

523
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,820
[Daniel] Ugh.

524
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,920
[Carlos] We did it one behind each other.

525
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,520
<i>And the first lap was gonna be all about
trying to get past Daniel again.</i>

526
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,856
[Simon] <i>Watch out for Sainz behind you.</i>

527
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,640
<i>He's also just left the box.</i>

528
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,480
[Daniel] <i>Understood.</i>

529
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,300
[Tom] Gap to Ricciardo now 1.9.
This is good, Carlos.

530
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,820
<i>Better than him, we're in good shape now.</i>

531
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,800
[man] <i>That's better.</i>

532
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,120
[Caco] Renault is struggling.

533
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,320
[Tom] <i>Right, let's go and get him, Carlos.</i>

534
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,100
[Simon] <i>Sainz in your DRS.</i>

535
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,436
[commentator] <i>And the roles are reversed.</i>

536
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,780
<i>Sainz back ahead of Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

537
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,820
[in Spanish] Come on!

538
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
Yes!

539
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,400
[Carlos in English] <i>Come on, boys! Yes!</i>

540
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,560
[Daniel] <i>He caught up to me so quickly.
I really couldn't do much else.</i>

541
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,160
[Simon] Okay, still a long way to go.
Let's stay focused.

542
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,040
Must get back into a rhythm.

543
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,600
[Tom] Good, Carlos, good job.

544
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,360
[Carlos] <i>That overtake move from Daniel
gave us the confidence.</i>

545
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,160
After that moment, I said,
"Maybe we can attack a bit more."

546
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,440
[Tom] <i>Okay, Carlos,
that's Grosjean in front.</i>

547
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,580
[commentator] <i>Sainz is in the points,
but hungry for more.</i>

548
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,416
[Carlos] <i>I had a heavy contact.
It was a heavy contact</i>

549
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,660
[Tom] <i>Copy.</i>

550
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,900
<i>Pressure's okay at the moment.</i>

551
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,800
[Caco] They were side to side.
He cannot turn in like that.

552
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,700
[commentator] <i>He's just got time
for one last go at Grosjean.</i>

553
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,980
[Caco] Come on!

554
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,000
[in Spanish] Come on!

555
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,340
Good!

556
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,380
Good!

557
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,320
[Carlos laughs]

558
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,520
[Tom in English] <i>That's a great job,
Carlos. Great job.</i>

559
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,640
[commentator] <i>Carlos Sainz
is up into eighth place.</i>

560
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Well done, mate.

561
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,960
[man] Well done. Well done.

562
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
[Caco] Yes!

563
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,080
[Tom] <i>Yes, Carlos, get in.</i>

564
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,840
<i>Great job, mate.</i>

565
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,860
[Simon] <i>And that's P12.</i>

566
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,640
<i>Sorry, man. Tough one.</i>

567
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,060
[Daniel] <i>Yeah, understood.</i>

568
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,420
<i>It's really hard to stay close with Sainz.</i>

569
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Sorry, guys.

570
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,040
[commentator] <i>Carlos Sainz,
another finish in the points</i>

571
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,800
<i>and giving his grandstand reason
to get on their feet.</i>

572
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,920
[Carlos] <i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>

573
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
That was fun.

574
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
[man] Thank you.

575
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,156
[Carlos] <i>I always said it.</i>

576
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,016
<i>You know,
I think it was more a matter of time.</i>

577
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,920
Deep in myself, I knew
what I needed to do to be quick.

578
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,540
[Rupert] Well done, mate.
Good job. Well done.

579
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,160
I have a feeling that McLaren knows
what they are doing

580
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,640
and I'm gonna trust it.

581
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,760
[in Spanish] Give me a high five.

582
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,480
[woman in English] Yay.
Well done, fucking amazing.

583
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,456
- [Zak] That was good.
- [man] Good race.

584
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,920
Good job, guys.

585
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,200
[Zak] <i>Carlos has been very impressive.</i>

586
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,500
I like his aggression, I like his speed.

587
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,020
[Carlos] Thank you, guys.

588
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,740
Cheers. Thank you very much.

589
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,240
[Zak] <i>He hasn't put a wheel wrong.</i>

590
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,000
And I can see him being with McLaren
for quite some time.

591
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,460
[Daniel] <i>I was a bit frustrated
with how the race panned out.</i>

592
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,220
<i>Yeah, I've had a few battles with Carlos,
but the McLarens have turned it on</i>

593
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,180
<i>and they've certainly been
our kind of midfield target this year.</i>

594
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,440
<i>They've got a pretty good car.</i>

595
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,640
<i>I need to be smart
and use my strengths as a driver</i>

596
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,220
<i>to kind of work around
maybe some of the weaknesses in the car.</i>

597
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,180
<i>I expected myself to get it quicker.</i>

598
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,856
[Cyril] <i>You know,
there is no real question mark</i>

599
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,200
<i>about the capacity of Daniel
to be a strong driver.</i>

600
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,220
I feel that the team is ready for Daniel.

601
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,100
<i>We are ready for that partnership.</i>

602
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,000
We just need to work harder
and give him a better car,

603
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,300
so that he can bring the team
to a different dimension.

604
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,460
[man] <i>Formula 1 racing
is very much like war planning.</i>

605
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,900
Let's crush them.

606
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,540
Yes!

607
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,540
Body's feeling sore, heart is racing.

608
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,880
[exclaiming] Fuck! How is this possible?

609
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,240
[man] It was a fucking shit day
at the office.

610
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,036
[Christian] Come on, Geraldine,
you'll be late to your own concert.

611
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,600
Hello. Who the fuck are you?

612
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,440
[man] <i>Pierre Gasly
got off to a horrible start.</i>

613
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,660
[Pierre] Fuck!

614
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,340
[man] <i>We will give Alex Albon a run.</i>

615
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,920
It's like an F1 car on steroids.

616
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
