第六季  第六集

10
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,470
<i>孩子们  在2010年的秋天</i>
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2010,</i>

11
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,670
<i>我们的朋友斯图尔特和克劳蒂娅的孩子降临人世</i>
<i>our friends</i> <i>Stuart and Claudia had a baby,</i>

12
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>马修和莉莉立马就去拜访了</i>
<i>and Marshall and Lily</i> <i>were the first</i>

13
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,210
<i>这对兴奋的新父母</i>
<i>to visit the happy new parents.</i>

14
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,980
你们给孩子取名字了吗
<i>So, have you guys</i> landed on a name yet?

15
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,680
我们在努力  可这比想像的难多了
We're trying, but it's tougher than you think.

16
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,280
我喜欢蒂芙妮
You see, I like "Tiffany."

17
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,620
我可不希望我女儿的名字跟妓女一样
And I don't want my daughter to have a whore's name.

18
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,650
那是我妈的名字
That's my mother's name.

19
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,090
我知道
I know.

20
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,260
我知道了
Oh, I got it.

21
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,290
那孩子以你来命名吧  "性冷淡泼妇"
How 'bout we name the baby after you-- "Frigid Shrew."

22
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,530
那还不错
Oh, that's good.

23
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,630
不  不  不
No, no, no, no.

24
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,000
叫她"伏特加"吧
Let's call her "Vodka."

25
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,760
至少嗜酒如命的你会抱紧她
Then at least we know you'd hold her tight

26
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,030
打死也不撒手
and never let her go!

27
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,700
不要拿伏特加说事儿  没它哪来的孩子
Don't knock the vodka. Wouldn't have a kid without it.

28
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,410
斯图尔特  你简直太
Stuart, you are so...

29
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,910
我们不会这样的  对不对
That's not gonna be us, right?

30
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,340
给孩子取个名字还能多难
I mean, how hard can it be to name a baby?

31
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,240
没错  看看这个孩子
Right? I mean, just look at her. Yeah.

32
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,680
她显然该叫
She's clearly a...

33
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,950
-埃米莉  -丽莎
- Emily.  - Lisa.

34
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,380
-丽莎  -埃米莉
- Lisa?!  - Emily?!

35
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,570
我列了个名单  里面的名字都超赞
Okay!  I made a list of awesome baby names.

36
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,370
从头开始  第一个是
Starting at the top: number one...

37
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,170
马修  我不得不打断你一下
I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall.

38
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,980
你管一个胖乎乎白人小孩叫勒布朗
You name a chubby white kid "LeBron,"

39
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,210
结果他腰围比篮球筐还粗
and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.

40
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,100
那我把这些篮球明星的都删了  沙奎尔
Then I'm also crossing off, um, "Shaquille"...

41
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,090
哈基姆  迪坎贝
"Hakeem," and "Dikembe."

42
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,820
罗伯怎么样
Hey, what about "Rob"?

43
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,150
罗伯
"Rob"?

44
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,920
-不  -为什么不
- No.  - Why not?

45
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,690
罗伯  你打算怎么做火鸡
Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make a turkey?

46
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,030
罗伯不行
Not "Rob."

47
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,430
瑞安怎么样
Okay, um, how about "Ryan"?

48
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,810
瑞安不行
Not "Ryan."

49
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,540
强尼
"Johnny?"

50
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,810
金鱼在哪去了
Hey, where's the goldfish?

51
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,590
强尼不行
Not "Johnny."

52
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,660
吉尔也不行
Or "Gil."

53
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,430
杰里米
"Jeremy."

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,760
杰里米  不要
Jeremy, no!

55
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,670
杰里米绝对不行
Definitely not "Jeremy."

56
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,070
他画的东西毫无创意可言
His stuff was so derivative.

57
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,010
天啊  莉莉
Well, I mean, geez, Lily.

58
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,180
不管你们取什么名字
Well, whatever you do,

59
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,250
都不会叫贝基对吧
do not name your baby "Becky," right?

60
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,810
-为什么  -什么
- Why?  - What? What?

61
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,750
贝基  我的新搭档
Becky. My new co-anchor?

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,050
你们从来没看过我的节目
Don't you guys ever watch the show?

63
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,820
-亲爱的  我试过  -我们的数字视频录像机
- Oh, honey, I really try.  - Our DVR won't recognize it

64
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,390
不能把它识别为电视节目
as a television program.

65
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,260
我看了
I watched.

66
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,460
罗宾坚持让我目睹一下  贝基有多么糟糕
Robin insisted I confirm how "awful" Becky is,

67
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,930
所以昨天晚上我确认了一下
so last night I checked it out.

68
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,630
这个地区的和谈
Peace talks in the region

69
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,470
被称为"卓有成效"
have been described as, "productive."

70
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,670
贝基
Becky?

71
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,100
昨天晚上  在斯塔腾岛
Last night, in Staten Island,

72
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,770
墨西哥卷饼商贩被持枪抢劫
a taco cart owner was robbed at gunpoint.

73
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,110
那太可怜了
That's so sad.

74
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,380
贝基  我们是新闻工作者
Becky, we're-we're journalists.

75
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,250
不能对这些新闻感情用事
We can't get emotional about the news, we...

76
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,550
不
Oh, no!

77
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,380
他们偷了他所有的钱
They stole all his money and then pelted him

78
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,980
还用卷饼里的肉打他
with his own taco meat!

79
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,620
谁会做这种事
Who would do that?

80
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,220
如果你看了这个故事  我们就会揭发出来
Well, if you read the story, we might find out.

81
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,390
我能报关于马的这个吗
Oh, can I do this one, about the horse?

82
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,430
马什么的  最有爱了
I love horseys.

83
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,630
马死了
Aww, the horse died.

84
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,930
大伙
Guys!

85
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,600
这些新闻全部都让人悲痛
This news is all really sad.

86
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,610
你就毫不留情地说吧  贝基怎么样
Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?

87
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,950
我觉得她非常迷人
I thought she was charming.

88
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,180
你也觉得
You, too?

89
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,680
有人能给我解释一下
Can somebody please explain to me

90
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,650
为什么这个小妞要在男人面前装童真
why the little girl act works on men?

91
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,250
你想要听长话长说  还是长话短说呢
You want the long version or the short version?

92
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,720
短说
Short version.

93
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,190
长话短说
Short version.

94
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,920
谁是你爹地
Who's your daddy?

95
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,360
当这句话从你口中说出来
You know, when you think about that,

96
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
感觉特变态
that phrase is really creepy.

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,960
不  挺有意思的
No, it's not. It's fun.

98
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,360
来  我说一遍
Here, watch this.

99
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,200
莉莉  谁是你爹地
Hey, Lily... Who's your daddy?

100
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,170
好吧  我把中心思想说明白点
Okay, uh, let me get this straight.

101
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,440
在这个剧情里
So, in, uh, in this scenario,

102
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,510
因为你这么宠爱莉莉
because you make such sweet love to Lily,

103
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,210
现在她是你女儿
she is now your daughter.

104
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,080
不  她不是我女儿
No, she is not my daughter.

105
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,810
我只是她床上的主人
I'm just her daddy.

106
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,050
真让人厌恶
Wow. That is disgusting.

107
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,180
没错  反过来就不成立了
Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work.

108
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,920
男人童言童语地说话
There's no way a guy could pick up a girl,

109
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,290
是泡不到妞的
going around talking like a little boy.

110
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,950
-接受挑战  -不
- Challenge accepted.  - No.

111
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,860
我  巴尼・斯丁森
I, Barney Stinson,

112
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,190
能用童言童语泡到妞

113
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,900
这是我想的名字候选单
Okay. Here's my list of baby names.

114
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,330
泰拉怎么样
Oh. What about "Tara"?

115
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,170
不  泰拉不行
No. Not "Tara."

116
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,100
泰拉是我们学校的校花
Tara was the hottest girl in my high school.

117
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,670
我们所有人都对她着迷
We were all, like, obsessed with her.

118
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,310
<i>我们不仅仅谈论她</i>
<i>We didn't just talk about her</i>

119
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,880
意淫她
<i>and fantasize about her...</i>

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,740
还写了一首歌  歌颂她
<i>We wrote songs about her.</i>

121
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,620
泰拉  你翘臀的曲线  迷死人 *
* Tara, your booty is so smooth

122
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,190
希望这不会太无礼 *
* And I hope this isn't rude

123
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,990
但我真的想上它 *
* But I want to get up on it.

124
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,760
泰拉不行
Not "Tara."

125
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,000
埃斯特怎么样

Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney.

130
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,170
那个肋排肉确实很不错
That prime rib was surprisingly good,

131
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,610
但现在才早上十点半
but it's 10:30 in the morning.

132
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,880
我还没性趣看女人跳脱衣舞
I don't need to see a lady get naked and dance.

133
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,210
衣服是肯定脱掉的
Oh, Esther gets naked.

134
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,450
但是埃斯特不表演跳舞
But she doesn't dance.

135
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,650
那她干嘛
Then what does she do?

136
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,390
偶滴个神呐
Sweet mother nature!

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,160
这真是我刚抽的牌
That was my card!

138
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,600

140
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,540
埃斯特不行
Not "Esther."

我得来一杯  泰德  泰德
I need a drink. Ted? Ted?

142
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,920
马修  你的名单是全是男孩名
Marshall, your list is entirely boy names.

143
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
你知道你有大概一半的可能
You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance

144
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,450
会生个女儿的吧
of you having a daughter, right?

145
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,890
好吧  说实在的  我从没想过会生女孩
Okay, honestly, I've never thought about having a girl.

146
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,130
我也不想去考虑生女孩的事
I don't want to think about having a girl.

147
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,560
泰拉  埃斯特
Tara, Esther--

148
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,000
你能想象当那种妞的老爹  有多悲惨吗
can you imagine being one of those girls' dads?

149
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,770

154

155
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,150
我才会堕落干这行
That's why I do this.

156
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,720
我完全不知道该怎么养女儿
I have no idea how to raise a daughter!

157
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,120
万一她走歪路  怎么办
What if she makes bad choices?

158
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,330
我是说  要是她最后和那些...
I mean, what if she winds up dating some...

159
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,230
上帝啊
Oh, God.

160
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,830
老爸  我要给你介绍我的新男友
Papa, I want you to meet my new boyfriend.

161

感谢你生出如此尤物
Thanks for making such a hottie.

163
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,840
谁是爹O
Who's your daddy?

164
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,540
你咯  因为我们嘿咻得那么爽
You are, 'cause of all the sex we have.

165
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,350
我不想要女儿
I don't want a girl.

166
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,680
我只想要个小子
I just want a little boy.

167
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,820
大伙别误会  我们是正常取向
It's not what it sounds like, folks.

168
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,170
嗨  老妈  老爸
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

169
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,740
马修  是你吗
Marshall? Is that you?

170
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,110
呃  那个
Oh, okay, um...

171
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,850
你们俩离摄像头太近了
You guys, you're a little too close to the camera.

172
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,250
能往后退退吗
Can you back up a bit?

173
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,180
这样行吗
How's this?

174
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,720
每回都这样
Every time.

175
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,720
你们能不能就坐在电脑前
Um, can you just sit in front of the computer

176
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,220
像个正常人类
like normal human beings?

177
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,690
很好
Perfect!

178
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,830
很好
Perfect.

179
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,530
怎么啦  射手
What's up, shooter?

180
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,600
老实说  我有点害怕
Um, to be honest, I'm getting a little freaked out

181
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,300
要是生个女儿怎么办
about the idea of having a daughter.

182
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,930
我知道你们也没啥经验
I know you two probably aren't the right people to talk to about this.

183
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,300
你们生了一窝小子
You had all boys.

184
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,040
呃  那是走了狗屎运
Oh, well, that was just dumb luck.

185
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,640
亲爱的  你能给我从小屋里拿瓶啤酒吗
Hey, honey, would you get me a brewski from out of the shed?

186
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,610
当然  你要什么吗  马修
Sure. You want anything, Marshall?

187
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,180
我在电脑这边  妈
I'm in a computer, Mom.

188
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,650
是啊  都是儿子
Yeah, all boys.

189
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,580
完全华丽丽的巧合
Total co-winky-dink.

190
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,420
压根没巧合这回事
It was no co-winky-dink.

191
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,950
自维京时代以来
Since the Viking age,

192

埃里克森家族便世代相传着一个怀上男孩的

193

00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,790
第一  避开柠檬
Number one, avoid lemons.

195
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,060
那是女婴的肥料
They're baby girl fertilizer.

196
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,800
好吧  没别的意思  老爸
Okay... No offense, Dad,

197
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,630
但我强烈怀疑这没有科学依据
but I doubt there's any scientific data to support--

198
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,000
"我强烈怀疑这没有科学依据"
"I doubt there's any scientific data to support.."

199
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,640
我生的都是儿子

事实胜于雄辩
Scoreboard!

203
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,880
你要听谁的
Who you gonna listen to?

204
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,050
你爹我  还是"科学依据"
Me? Or "Scientific data"?

205
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,850

问问人家昨天干什么了
Ask me what I did yesterday.

就在他的公寓楼下哦

等下  你是跟泰德・莫斯比出去吗
Wait-- did you go out with Ted Mosby?

226
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,200

大伙  我和罗宾的室友一起出去哦

229
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,370

She's a messy Bessie.

230
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,980
另一则消息  今天的晚些时候

232
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,250
泰德  纽约遍地都是妞儿
Ted, of all the women in New York,

233
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,950
你非得去泡一个八岁女孩吗
You had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?

234
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,820
大家别误会  我是正常取向
Not what it sounds like, folks.

235
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,920
泰德  你知道我讨厌她
Ted, you know that i hate her.

236
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,460
你怎么可以跟她出去约会呢
How could you go out on a date with this girl?

237
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,730
我们没有约会
It wasn't a date.

238
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,960
她来我们公寓找你
She came over to the apartment looking for you.

239
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,330
我做了最拿手的巧克力碎片饼干给罗宾哦
I made Robin my famous chocolate chip cookies.

240
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,440
但是我放的不是巧克力碎片  而是熊熊软糖
But instead of chocolate chips, I used gummie bears.

241
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,940
有蜘蛛
A spider!

242
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,480
我来猜猜  她是不是装成一个无助的小女孩
Let me guess, she acted like a helpless little girl,

243
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,080
而你就成了那个救了她的英勇猛男
and you stepped in as the big, strong man.

244
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,620
我不确定事发当时是不是那样
I don't know if that's totally true.

245
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,550
没事的  小宝贝
It's okay, little darlin'.

246
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,220
好可怜的小蜘蛛
Poor spider.

247
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:14,000
只有蜘蛛消亡了  树木才能得以成长
Spiders gotta die so trees can grow.

248
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,970
然后我紧紧抱住她  告诉她不会有事的
Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay.

249
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,840
对了  我好像只是弄伤了那只蜘蛛
By the way, I think I only wounded the spider.

250
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,310
它后来爬进了我卧室
It crawled off into my bedroom.

251
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,340
等等  你昨晚睡在沙发就是因为这事吗
Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?

252
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,350
是啊  我一宿不敢合眼
Yeah, I slept.

253
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,050
快折腾死哥了
I'm dying out here.

254
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,120
女人们根本不吃童言童语这一招
Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.

255
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,060

Come on!

263
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,610
给我两秒钟就好  宝贝
I just need two seconds, baby.

264
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,150
我知道你可能会觉得  这是在夸奖你
I know you think that's a compliment,

265
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,710
但我还是希望你慢慢来
but I'd rather you took your time.

266
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,220
不是的  我马上回来
No, um... I'll be right back.

267
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,360
古代北欧的知识显示  想生儿子
Ancient Norse wisdom tells us that, to sire a son,

268
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,170
在你与夫人行房之前  必须先做三件事
you must do three things right before you lay with your maiden.

269
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,070
一  吃腌鲱鱼
First, eat pickled herring.

270
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,070
吃下去
Eat it!

271
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,740
这就是歪理谬论
This is ridiculous.

272
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,280
先生们  先生们  在主舞台上
Gentlemen, gentlemen, on the main stage,

273
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,850
为爱放弃大好前程
throwing her life away,

274
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,150
让我们一起为马修的乖女儿鼓掌
give it up for Marshall's daughter!

275
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,190
谁是你的爷爷
Who's your granddaddy?

276
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,360
那家伙
That guy.

277
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,170
你想要跟我  以及我幻想的朋友一起3P吗
Hey, want to have a three-way with me and my imaginary friend?

他的名字叫欧提斯
His name's Otis.

279
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,680
你想来我家一起玩传声筒电话吗

我尿裤子了
I wet myself!

282
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,720
你愿意帮我换衣服吗
Will you change me?

283
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,890
是我也会甩头走人  有点过了
Can't blame her on that one.

284
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,300
大伙们
Guys...

285
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,500

我  巴尼・斯丁森

287
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,200
没办法用童言童语来泡到一个妞
can't pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.

288
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,570
挑战放弃
Challenge forfeited.

289
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,040
-没事  根本没人在乎  -没人向你挑战
- Yeah, we don't care about this... - No one challenged you,

290
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,540
所以那根本不算是个挑战
so it wasn't really a challenge.

291
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,480
我对不起你们
I'm sorry.

292
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,850
吉拉德  你那衣服是怎么回事
Hey, Gerard, what's with that shirt?

293
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,820
穿着那衣服  鬼才会被你泡到
Nobody could pick up a chick wearing that thing.

294
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,590
挑战接
Challenge accept...

295
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,460
我很庆幸那终于结束了
Wow, I'm glad that's over.

296
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,400
巴尼像个孩子般说话  真令人起鸡皮疙瘩
It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid.

297
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,660
但是贝基那样说话  你就无法抵抗吗
Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does?

298
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,070
我真搞不懂
I don't get it.

299
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,140
那位跟我交往过的泰德
The Ted that I went out with

300
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,140
居然会喜欢一个  在没人成人监管下
was attracted to the kind of woman

301
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,970
不能独自使用一把牛排刀的女人
who could use a steak knife without supervision.

302
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,310
事实上  贝基不喜欢牛排
For your information, Becky doesn't like steak,

303
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,470
她喜欢大意利面
she likes pasghetti.

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,710
意大利面

305
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,540
更重要的是  她令我感觉被人需要

306
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,550
被需要
Needed?

307
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,680
她让学步车感到被需要
She makes training wheels feel needed.

308
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,450
被人需要的感觉很好  而且你知道吗
Hey, it's nice to feel needed. And you know what?

309
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,850
那是种跟你在一起的男人  无法得到的感觉
It's not a feeling guys get when they're with you.

310
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,930
儿啊
Son...

311
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,460
维京人的学问告诉我们  想确保
Viking lore tells us that to ensure the continuation

312
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,830
你的高贵男性血脉得以延续

313
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,140
弄一大碗的冰块
Get a big old bowl of ice

314
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,900
然后把你的蛋蛋狠狠地泡进去

315
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,870
你俩在聊你们的大球球呢

316
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,750
好吧
Okay.

317
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,700
接下来上床准备行动  先把莉莉转向北方
Now get in there, point Lily due north

318
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,160
然后就给我搞个孙子出来

319
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,600

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,540
埃里克森  勇往直前

321
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,810
当年我们在约会时  我没让你感觉被需要吗
When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed?

322
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,120
拜托  你在任何事上都想要主控权
Come on! You always took charge of everything.

323
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,950

Did that really bother you?

330
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,970
有一点吧  被人需要的感觉很好
Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed.

331

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,310
我不是故意要让你不开心的
I didn't mean to upset you.

333
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,750
是贝基
It's Becky.

334
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,420
她被困在了一个旋转门里
Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door.

335
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,220
交给我吧
I got this.

336
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,520

来搞个孩子吧
Let's make a baby!

338

宝贝  你那是雪球
Baby, you're packing snowballs,

339
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,970
而且你的口气闻起来像是一股屁味
and your breath smells like a mermaid fart.

340
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,700
爱死了你的浪语
Loving the dirty talk.

341
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,900
但你知道什么更让人情欲高涨吗
But you know what's even hotter?

342
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,540
头冲这边更爽哦
If we face this a way.

343
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,140
我们好坏坏
Ooh, we're bad.

344
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,870
等等  宝贝
Wait... hey, baby,

345
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,740
为什么你要把我转向北方
why are you facing me north?

346
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,550
你想让我生个儿子
You're trying to make us have a boy.

347
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,980
我  可以  解
I... can ex...

348
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,090
你怎么知道头冲北这件事
How do you know about the north thing?

349
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,320
还有那些柠檬是怎么回事
And what are you doing with those lemons?

350
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,390
女孩受孕法
Baby girl fertilizer!

351
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,130
你想生个女儿
You're trying to make us have a girl!

352
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,140
你居然想生个女儿
You are tring to make us have a girl.

353
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,910
我最不喜欢的学生都是男孩子
All my least favorite students have been boys.

354
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,680
所以我在谷歌上搜索"女孩制造大法"
So I Googled "how to make a girl"--

355
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,620
一堆很黄很暴力的东西出现
some really weird stuff came up

356
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,350
不过最后我找到了一个  受孕的网站
but finally, I found this conception web site

357
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,390
它说你应该
that said you should...

358
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,720
在行房时  面向南方
Point south at the moment of conception...

359
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,290
吃个柠檬
eat a lemon...

360
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,670
把你的私密处  慢慢加热到40度左右
and heat up your lady parts to a balmy 105 degrees.

361
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,510
感觉还不赖
Oh, that's not bad.

362
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,050
埃里克森  勇往直前
Eriksen!

363
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,750
莉莉  你怎么可以
Lily, how could you do...

364
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,150
跟我做一模一样的事情呢
exactly the same thing I did?

365
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,990
你本应该支持我  跟我一样想要男孩
You're supposed to be the same one.

366
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,120
瞧  又是个期望女人
See that? Another boy expecting a woman

367
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,590
来给自己过失善后的男孩
to clean up his mistakes.

368
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,960
这就是女孩比男孩强的原因
That's why girls are way better than boys.

369
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,500
是吗  那为什么每部恐怖片里
Oh, really. Well, then how come whenever there's

370
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,860
演那种令人毛骨悚然的小孩  都是个小女孩呢
a creepy kid in a horror movie it's always a little girl?

371
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,470
又或是一对女双胞胎  她们连说话都是
Or twin girls, who speak...

372
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,740
异口同声
in unison.

373
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,600
那恰奇呢[美国恐怖片《鬼娃孽种》里的主人公]
Oh, well, what about Chucky?

374
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,570
第一  他是个公仔
Okay, A) He was a doll;

375
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,880
第二  是在成人连环杀手指使他做事
B) He was possessed by an <i>adult</i> serial killer;

376
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,910
第三  你为什么要在睡前提起恰奇呢
and C) How could you bring up Chucky right before bed?

377
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,050
呃  我们约会的时候
Um, when we were dating,

378
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,390
我  我有让你感觉被需要过吗
did... did I make you feel needed?

379
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,430
没  我一点儿也感觉不到你需要我
No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all.

380
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,730
果然不出所料
That's what I thought.

381
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,930
-打扰了  -等等  你这是
- Uh, I'm sorry. - Wait, where are you...

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,030
这是种赞美
That's a compliment.

383
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,900
你是我见过最独立的女人
You are the least needy woman I've ever met

384
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,400
这种女人最棒了
that's awesome.

385
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,510
我是说  没有人敢问罗宾・施巴斯基
I mean, no guy's gonna say

386
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,210
"谁是你爹地"
"Who's your daddy?" to Robin Scherbatsky.

387
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,640
你就是自己的主人
You're your own daddy.

388
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,180
不但身兼母职
And mommy.

389
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,950
有时候还像个住在小木屋的奇怪幸存大叔
And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin

390
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,480
边扛着猎枪  边抱怨着政府
with a shotgun blaming stuff on the government.

391
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:48,090
你是我上过最棒  最坚强
And that is what makes you the most amazing, strong...

392
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,360
最独立的女人

393

我从刚才就一直想问你
there's something that I wanted to ask you,

396
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,370
但我不知道怎么开口  那我说啦
and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes.

397
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,210
穿着围裙那个疯婆子是谁
Who's the crazy chick in the apron?

398
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,710
有个小淘气把他的公仔扔地上了
Someone naughty left his toys on the floor

399
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,820
作为惩罚  我要打小屁屁咯
and needs to be spanked on his tushy-tush.

400
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,790
哇哦  我刚可是戴着套的哦
Uh-oh, I'm in "twubble."

401
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,820
你怎么做到的
You did it? How?

402
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,390
昨晚  在承认战败之后
Last night, after admitting defeat,

403
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,790
我放纵自己
I just let myself go.

404
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,560
哇  看起来很好吃的样子
Mmm, that looks so good.

405
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,930
可以分点给我吗
Can I have some?

406
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,170
不行
No!

407
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,900
这是我的冰淇淋  不给你吃
It's <i>my</i> ice cream; you can't have <i>any.</i>

408
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,470
你应该学学如何分享
Someone needs to teach you how to share.

409
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,110
让妈咪来教教你吧
Who's your mommy?

410
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,950
挑战完成
Challenge completed!

411
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,450
现在  你能不能把这怪胎弄走
Now, uh, can you get this freak out of here?

412
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,720
我好怕怕哦
I'm really scared.

413
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,360
交给我吧
I got this.

414
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,730
所以你们终于在名字上达成共识了
Oh, so you finally agreed on a name?

415
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,130
那是因为
Uh, well,

416
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,670
有天晚上  她发高烧
the other night she ran a really high fever.

417
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,710
<i>凌晨三点  我们抱着她冲到急诊室</i>
<i>We rushed her to the emergency room at 3:00 in the morning,</i>

418
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,580
<i>但没有名字  医院不愿意接收她</i>
<i>But they wouldn't admit her without a name.</i>

419
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,420
就在那时  我们意识到我们的行为有多么愚蠢
Right then and there, we realized how <i>stupid</i> we were being.

420
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,850
我们看着对方
We looked at each other

421
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,890
名字就这么脱口而出
and, well, we just knew.

422
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,890
我们宝宝叫
Our baby's name is...

423
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,520
埃斯特
Esther.

424
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,460
埃斯特
Esther?

425
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,060
埃斯特
Esther!

426
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,760
真是个好名字
That's beautiful.

427
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,230
对啊
Yeah.

428
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,000
我们真愚蠢
We're idiots.

429
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,940
宝贝  孩子的名字和性别
Baby, names and gender, it's just, like..

430
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,240
在某种程度上  给我们一种错觉
it's some way of giving ourselves the illusion

431
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
以为我们能控制任何一切
that we have any control whatsoever.

432
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,310
我只想要一个健康快乐  重达将近11斤
I-I just want a healthy, happy, 12-pound--

433
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,080

7斤
Eight-pound?

436
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,490
我尽力吧  但是伙计
I guess, but, dude,

437
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,490
你一口气说了三个  我怕我的肚子不给力啊
you're writing checks my vagina can't cash.

438
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,960
我爱你
I love you.

439
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,600
无论生出来是男是女  我都会爱死我们的宝宝
And I'm gonna love the crap out of whatever baby we have.

440
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,760
我也是
Me, too.

441
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,670
你知道吗
You know what?

442
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,170
咱们应该先想一个男女通用的名字
We should just think of a name that's good for either a girl or a boy.

443
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,170
比如
Like, um...

444
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,510
杰米
Jamie.

445
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,210
马修
Marshall...

446
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,510
咱们宝宝有名字了
we just named our baby.

447
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,580
杰米
Jamie.

448
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,890
杰米绝对不行
Not Jamie.

449
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,250
鞋带开了  我帮你系上
Shoe's untied. I got it.

450
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,160
对  是该适可而止了
Yeah, this is over.
