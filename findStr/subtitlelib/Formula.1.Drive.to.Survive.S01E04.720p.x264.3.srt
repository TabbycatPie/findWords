1
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:14,925
<i>Formula One</i>
<i>has been called the "Piranha Club"</i>

2
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:19,165
<i>because of the amount</i>
<i>of sniping and biting.</i>

3
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:21,285
<i>It's much worse than swimming with sharks.</i>

4
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:24,125
<i> There's</i>
<i>so much money involved in the sport.</i>

5
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:26,805
<i>It is not just about</i>
<i>what you see at a Grand Prix track.</i>

6
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:29,085
<i>It's what goes on behind the scenes.</i>

7
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:33,845
<i>Absolutely cutthroat.</i>

8
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:40,365
If you want to be strong on the track,
you also need to be strong off track.

9
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:44,165
<i>Success in racing</i>
<i>comes down to just being stubborn.</i>

10
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,725
<i>A lot of your competitors</i>
<i>will fall apart before you will.</i>

11
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:51,045
<i>Politics are a big part</i>
<i>of the sport. It can get pretty nasty.</i>

12
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:58,085
<i> There's a lot of posturing,</i>
<i>positioning, total paranoia.</i>

13
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:02,085
<i>You always want</i>
<i>to destabilize your competitors.</i>

14
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:08,925
If you can't take the heat,
stay out of the kitchen.

15
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:35,005
This is, albeit a short one, the history
of the team, the championship years.

16
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:38,605
Winning four championships.
Max's first victory.

17
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:40,365
Daniel's first victory.

18
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:46,165
What we've actually done in
the last 15 years is pretty significant.

19
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:47,405
<i>You know, this was our first winner.</i>

20
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:49,845
<i>This was the first</i>
<i>Driver's Championship car.</i>

21
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:51,885
<i>It was the first</i>
<i>Constructor's Championship car.</i>

22
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:54,965
Great job, Sebastian.
Proud of you. Great job.

23
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:58,605
To take on all the great teams
at that time, you know, really,

24
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:02,245
<i>the start of a totally dominant period</i>
<i>for Red Bull Racing.</i>

25
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:06,325
We're an energy drinks manufacturer.
We're the maverick in Formula One.

26
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:08,565
<i>We've won eight World Championships.</i>

27
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:12,405
<i>But in the last few years,</i>
<i>we've lagged behind.</i>

28
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:17,085
<i>We need to challenge the big teams.</i>

29
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:20,085
<i>Our Achilles' heel has been the engine.</i>

30
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:23,925
<i>And it is</i>
<i>absolute double disaster for Red Bull.</i>

31
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,885
<i>Both have just plain broken down.</i>

32
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:29,045
<i>And that's been</i>
<i>immensely frustrating for us.</i>

33
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:31,445
<i>We have to raise our game.</i>

34
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:47,445
You know that the good thing
about Renault in Formula One...

35
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:51,285
I think that, obviously,
the only possibility to live in Paris

36
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:54,685
and work in Formula One,
which is not that bad.

37
00:02:57,525 --> 00:03:00,885
<i>We are French.</i>
<i>We are passionate.</i>

38
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:08,525
<i>Renault is a partly state-owned company,</i>
<i>so it really belongs to the French people.</i>

39
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:13,405
This position in which I am currently,
it's a huge privilege.

40
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:18,125
Come in. Go on, go on, go on.
Lunch is part of life, so...

41
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:20,925
It's a very important part of life.

42
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:22,485
Thank you.

43
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:26,205
We are a French team.
We have the best table in the paddock.

44
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,165
And it has to be the same at the factory.

45
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:35,165
Renault is one of the few teams
that make a Formula One engine.

46
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:38,205
We also happen to supply
those engines to other teams.

47
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:44,365
Getting a Formula One engine right
is very complicated,

48
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:47,085
because we are talking
about many components.

49
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:49,725
<i>Engine technology is very complex.</i>

50
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:52,565
We also happen
to supply those engines to Red Bull.

51
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:56,085
<i>It's a customer, but at the same time,</i>
<i>they're our competitors.</i>

52
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:59,885
<i>We at Red Bull, we don't make road cars.</i>

53
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:01,965
<i>We're not an engine manufacturer.</i>

54
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:06,325
<i>We've bought our engines from Renault</i>
<i>for the past twelve seasons.</i>

55
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:09,045
<i>We pay for the service</i>
<i>that Renault provide...</i>

56
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:14,725
<i>but we're not consulted on any decisions</i>
<i>that are made regarding the layout,</i>

57
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:16,565
<i>the cooling, the exhaust,</i>

58
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:18,805
<i>the integration of the engine</i>
<i>into the chassis.</i>

59
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:23,965
<i>We have to accept</i>
<i>whatever Renault want to do.</i>

60
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:26,485
<i>And that is a big, big issue.</i>

61
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:31,325
Starting to have very strong comments
from Christian regarding performance.

62
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,125
<i>It is very clear</i>
<i>that the relationship with Red Bull</i>

63
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:36,165
<i>is going to a crunch time.</i>

64
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:39,525
<i>But the engine is progressing.</i>
<i>It's capable of winning races.</i>

65
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:44,085
<i>Every single race win that Red Bull had</i>
<i>was with Renault.</i>

66
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:50,845
We've had a love-hate relationship
with Renault for the last twelve years.

67
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:54,605
You know, Renault have fallen behind
their rivals in Ferrari and Mercedes,

68
00:04:54,685 --> 00:05:01,165
and, you know, that's caused frustration,
friction in the relationship, tension.

69
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,245
<i>He's clearly someone who wants to control</i>

70
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:07,045
<i>every single element of this car.</i>

71
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:10,045
<i>But unfortunately, he has to accept</i>

72
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,405
<i>that there is one element</i>
<i>they're not controlling.</i>

73
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:17,845
<i>With that engine supply,</i>
<i>we've been paying to fly in first class,</i>

74
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:20,485
<i>but ended up with an economy ticket.</i>

75
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:25,445
<i>Bang-for-buck value for money</i>
<i>is crucial to us.</i>

76
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,645
And it's a very, very important year
for the team,

77
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,725
<i>so we need to make a decision.</i>

78
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:08,925
<i>Daniel, happy birthday.</i>

79
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:13,645
Yeah, I just got a warm welcome.
I got, um, a birthday...

80
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:16,525
a birthday massacre.

81
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:19,365
<i> Aw. Have a great race, okay?</i>
<i>Love you, B.</i>

82
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,405
-Yeah. All right. Gangster.
<i>-Love you.</i>

83
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:46,445
-I don't even-- It was a very good one.
-That was good, huh? That shit's ad hoc.

84
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:49,605
I woke up early 'cause it's my birthday.
I was so excited.

85
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:58,325
<i>I've been with Red Bull since 2008.</i>

86
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,365
<i>Now that contract is coming</i>
<i>to an end this year, and...</i>

87
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:04,205
<i>when it comes to looking ahead,</i>

88
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:06,405
<i>you've kind of gotta see who's doing what.</i>

89
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:09,005
<i>You gotta try and figure out</i>
<i>who's gonna dominate</i>

90
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:11,205
<i>for the next, you know,</i>
<i>one to three years.</i>

91
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:21,045
Welcome, Daniel Ricciardo
and Max Verstappen!

92
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:24,805
A nice birthday present.
Shoe size, 58.

93
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,325
<i>The main thing for me</i>

94
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,565
<i>is to put myself</i>
<i>in the best car with a chance to win</i>

95
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:32,365
<i>to try and see</i>
<i>if I'm the best in the world</i>

96
00:07:32,445 --> 00:07:34,325
<i>and show what I believe I've got.</i>

97
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:36,965
<i>Where I am in my career--</i>

98
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:40,245
<i>I'm 29 now. If I'm ever, ever gonna be</i>
<i>world champion,</i>

99
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,765
<i>making this decision is massive.</i>

100
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:45,765
One more time,
Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen.

101
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:50,565
- Anything I need to be aware of?
- Um...

102
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:51,885
Daniel was positive?

103
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:54,965
-He said discussions had moved on.
-Yeah.

104
00:07:55,045 --> 00:07:57,405
-The next couple of weeks...
-Yeah.

105
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:59,765
...he would hope to be giving an answer.

106
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:03,005
-Basically, before the summer break.
-Okay, good. Super.

107
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:04,085
Yeah.

108
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:05,805
Let's go here.

109
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:11,005
You couldn't see any reason why Daniel
wouldn't re-sign with you guys?

110
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:14,925
That you were confident that he would.
Feeling more confident this week?

111
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:18,645
We're very happy with Daniel.
We hope that we retain him in the team.

112
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:21,725
He's in a great car.
He's a championship contender this year.

113
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,205
I can't imagine him anywhere else.

114
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,245
Hello.

115
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:33,805
Hi, how are you?

116
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:35,925
Hello.

117
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,925
<i>We are currently fourth in championship,</i>

118
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:42,445
<i>and Red Bull are third.</i>

119
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:47,725
Red Bull is obviously a great brand...
uh, but to drink.

120
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:51,565
<i>Renault is one</i>
<i>of the largest car makers in the world.</i>

121
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:55,205
<i>We are here for building</i>
<i>the reputation of our brand.</i>

122
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:58,645
<i>It's all about playing catch up</i>
<i>against Red Bull.</i>

123
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:03,685
<i>We have impatient shareholders,</i>

124
00:09:03,765 --> 00:09:07,005
<i>impatient sponsors, impatient drivers.</i>

125
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:12,085
<i>The Renault team cannot outperform us.</i>

126
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:20,725
<i>Teammates...</i>
<i>we've been super competitive.</i>

127
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:25,605
<i>Naturally, with that,</i>
<i>there becomes a competition, a rivalry...</i>

128
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:27,725
<i>a lot of friction, tension.</i>

129
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:35,285
<i>My teammate, but also my biggest rival.</i>

130
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:40,485
<i>I need to be the faster driver of the two.</i>
<i>I hate to lose.</i>

131
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:45,965
<i>All this contract talk,</i>
<i>it does put more pressure on me.</i>

132
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:49,885
<i>When it comes to these negotiations,</i>

133
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,445
<i>to strengthen your position,</i>
<i>winning is important.</i>

134
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:56,965
-Have a good one.
-Thanks.

135
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:58,365
Get your head down.

136
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:24,405
<i>Now only moments away</i>
<i>from the start of the Austrian Grand Prix.</i>

137
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:36,485
- <i>Radio check, please.</i>
<i>- Yep, Rennie, that's good.</i>

138
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:38,925
<i>- Things should happen today.</i>

139
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,925
<i>Ricciardo needs</i>
<i>his third win of the season here</i>

140
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:44,685
<i>to stay in contention</i>
<i>for the championship.</i>

141
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,885
<i>Verstappen has started well!</i>

142
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,445
<i>Daniel Ricciardo is trying</i>
<i>to get past Grosjean.</i>

143
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:07,045
<i>And he's up into fifth!</i>

144
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:11,685
<i>Renault also battling through the pack.</i>

145
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:17,565
<i>Carlos Sainz,</i>
<i>oh, bit of a collision there.</i>

146
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:24,165
<i>Oh, now his teammate Nico Hülkenberg</i>
<i>has a major problem.</i>

147
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:26,725
<i>Loss of power. I've lost power.</i>

148
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:30,485
<i>Stop the car, please, Nicky.</i>
<i>You've got fire at the back of the car.</i>

149
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,805
<i>And that's game over.</i>

150
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:34,045
<i>Appears to be</i>
<i>an engine issue for Renault.</i>

151
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:38,605
<i>Ricciardo, closing up on Kimi Räikkönen.</i>

152
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:51,685
<i>Good move, mate. Nice job.</i>

153
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:55,325
<i>And up into third place now.</i>

154
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:00,965
<i>Okay, so, Hamilton is only</i>
<i>18 seconds ahead.</i>

155
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:02,005
<i>Okay.</i>

156
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:04,605
<i>Into the pit lane,</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton for Mercedes,</i>

157
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:07,965
<i>currently in the lead,</i>
<i>but now he's in for his tire change.</i>

158
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:09,445
<i>Hamilton is in the pit lane.</i>

159
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,925
<i>So, push now. Push on if you can.</i>

160
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:14,045
<i>Now will Ricciardo</i>
<i>be able to overtake Hamilton</i>

161
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,685
<i>as he comes from the pit lane?</i>

162
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,925
- <i>Gonna be close. Gonna be close.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

163
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:23,925
<i>Hamilton one second behind you.</i>

164
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,125
<i>Red Bull suddenly smell</i>
<i>a victory here today.</i>

165
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,245
Oh!

166
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:37,245
<i> What was that coming out</i>
<i>of the back of the Red Bull?</i>

167
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:38,925
<i>Losing gear sync.</i>

168
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,005
<i>Fail. Two fail, Daniel.</i>
<i>We have got an issue.</i>

169
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:42,525
<i>It's the rear.</i>

170
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:44,925
<i>It's getting really bad now.</i>

171
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,565
<i>Okay. Fail. Two fail.</i>

172
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,805
<i>We're gonna have to retire, Daniel.</i>
<i>Retire.</i>

173
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:52,085
<i>Oh, he's got a problem. He's stopping!</i>

174
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:53,925
<i>Daniel Ricciardo is out of the race.</i>

175
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:56,205
<i>If you can,</i>
<i>pull over at turn one, please.</i>

176
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:57,365
<i>Pull over at turn one.</i>

177
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:59,565
<i>I'll tell you later,</i>
<i>but we've got some issues</i>

178
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,805
<i>at the rear end of the car.</i>

179
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:02,085
<i>Sorry about that, mate.</i>

180
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:06,885
<i>Red Bull will not enjoy</i>
<i>the sights of a mechanical problem.</i>

181
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:10,405
<i>He is out of the Austrian Grand Prix.</i>

182
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:16,125
<i>Oh, dear. What a shame</i>
<i>for Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

183
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:19,365
<i>That's blown the candles out</i>
<i>on the birthday cake.</i>

184
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:23,205
<i>It's been a bad day for Renault.</i>

185
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:27,205
<i>Their sole remaining car finishes</i>
<i>in twelfth place with no points.</i>

186
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,765
<i>I know what I'm capable of,</i>
<i>but things seem to keep happening</i>

187
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,045
<i>out of my control. It's frustrating.</i>

188
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,805
<i>Do you know what day Max is in this week?</i>

189
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:50,685
<i>'Cause I wouldn't mind finding</i>
<i>half an hour with him</i>

190
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:55,045
just in the afternoon.
Cool. All right.

191
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,045
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay. Speak to you later.

192
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,485
<i>-Speak to you later.</i>
-Thanks. Bye-bye.

193
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:05,285
<i>Daniel's contract talks</i>
<i>and discussions have made progress.</i>

194
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:08,085
The only question that Daniel has,
quite openly is,

195
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:11,525
is the power unit going
to be able to compete with Mercedes

196
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:12,765
and Ferrari next year?

197
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:16,365
That is his only question,
in terms of the team's capabilities.

198
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:20,565
<i>The only question over our package</i>
<i>for next year is the engine.</i>

199
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:25,365
I have complete confidence that we can
become the best on the engine side.

200
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:28,525
Red Bull criticizing its supplier
is absolutely nothing new.

201
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:31,485
In a few weeks, we will not be
in a position to guarantee supply

202
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:32,965
to Red Bull anymore.

203
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:36,005
We need to order parts from the suppliers
to build the engine for next year.

204
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:39,525
I can't postpone forever--
forever the deadline.

205
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:42,165
So, if Red Bull Racing wants
to be supplied by Renault,

206
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:44,725
they need to let us know
as quickly as possible.

207
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:53,085
<i>What is the best route to competitiveness?</i>

208
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:55,245
<i>Is it to stay with Renault?</i>

209
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:59,565
<i>Or is it to move to another manufacturer?</i>

210
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:04,925
<i>One that would allow us to have</i>
<i>an input into the design of the engine</i>

211
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,605
<i>to create true harmony</i>
<i>between engine and chassis.</i>

212
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:14,485
<i>It's so crucial</i>
<i>we make the right decision.</i>

213
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,605
<i>At eight a.m. tomorrow morning,</i>
<i>we'll be announcing</i>

214
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:27,125
we will not be continuing
our relationship with Renault.

215
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:31,925
<i>We have got a breaking new story...</i>

216
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:34,845
<i>Christian Horner</i>
<i>is dumping Renault next season.</i>

217
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:38,405
<i>Renault would stop</i>
<i>supplying Red Bull from 2019...</i>

218
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:41,965
<i>That's millions of dollars Renault</i>
<i>will no longer be receiving next year.</i>

219
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:47,125
<i>A blow to the Renault brand, as one less</i>
<i>team has a Renault engine next year.</i>

220
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:49,845
<i>I'm in a bit of disbelief,</i>
<i>to be honest.</i>

221
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:50,885
<i>He lost faith.</i>

222
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,045
Yeah...

223
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,925
Who else is in the conference?

224
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:59,165
- They've got Cyril...
- Great.

225
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:15,205
-How are you?
-Yeah, could be better.

226
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:36,725
-Are all your bigwigs here this weekend?
-A few of them, yeah.

227
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:39,325
I'm sure.

228
00:16:57,405 --> 00:17:00,005
You know, we've decided to take
a different path for next year.

229
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:04,325
We've been following the progress
of Honda's development very closely.

230
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:06,445
And the decision we've made

231
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,965
is that Honda is absolutely
the right route for Red Bull.

232
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:14,205
We're all selfish in this business.
Renault's priorities are--

233
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:16,125
obviously are their own team.

234
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:21,805
From 2019, we won't be paying
the amounts we've been paying to Renault.

235
00:17:21,885 --> 00:17:25,325
It's exciting news for us.
2019, we're looking forward to it.

236
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:28,925
Cyril, can we get Renault's feelings
on the news from this week?

237
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:33,325
Yeah, well, the implication
of, uh, the termination of the deal

238
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:35,485
on our budget is really marginal.

239
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:39,565
Uh... yes, there was a substantial revenue
associated to that supply,

240
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:42,925
but there were
also substantial costs associated.

241
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:46,525
And clearly marginal in comparison
to a view of our budget

242
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:49,605
of our organization, as we speak.

243
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:53,965
- Thank you, bye-bye.
- That was juicy, wasn't it?

244
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:59,325
Now, you guys and Red Bull...

245
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:02,565
shall we say it's not been the happiest
of marriages for the last few years?

246
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:06,085
Sort of a marriage where you're hanging
around for the sake of the children,

247
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:09,285
rather than because you're
in love with each other.

248
00:18:09,365 --> 00:18:12,645
The Honda route is the best route forward
for us for the future.

249
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,525
Personally, I'm a bit sad,

250
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:17,525
because it's been twelve years or so
of my life, dealing with Christian...

251
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:19,165
No, Renault was very keen
to have us.

252
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:20,845
They were desperate even till last week.

253
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:22,685
We feel now that we don't
need Red Bull anymore.

254
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:25,245
We're still relying on Renault
in our current season.

255
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:27,445
How can you promise them
that the performance level

256
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,165
will be as high as possible?

257
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:32,005
And how has this news been received
by Daniel Ricciardo?

258
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,445
I think he sees the logic, the data
that we're looking at.

259
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,925
It's a no-brainer.

260
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:41,005
So, it boosts your chances
of retaining him.

261
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:42,485
I would think so, absolutely.

262
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:44,565
- There you go.
- Thank you very much.

263
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,205
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

264
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:49,605
I think that was all right.

265
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:52,005
Very entertaining.

266
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:00,325
<i>I need another excuse for a tattoo,</i>

267
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:04,325
<i>so I really wanna win a championship soon</i>
<i>so I can get something to represent that.</i>

268
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:09,965
All this contract talk, it's--
Winning is still the main thing for me.

269
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:13,285
At least top of my list,
it's be somewhere where I can win.

270
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:18,045
But I-- Maybe it comes with age,
but it needs to be a happy environment...

271
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,565
to be able to win.

272
00:19:19,645 --> 00:19:24,965
So, um... stay, change,
stick with what we know,

273
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:28,005
it's all that sort of concoction
of emotions, isn't it?

274
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,325
-It's a big decision.
-Yeah.

275
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:33,565
I turn thirty next year.
I'm getting old, so...

276
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:37,525
We're in the privileged position
of having more than one option.

277
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:40,845
Having interest
from other really good teams.

278
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:45,165
Yeah, it's just about making
the correct overall choice.

279
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:51,445
<i>We were both personally surprised</i>
<i>when Max announced that he'd extended.</i>

280
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:54,605
<i>Their focus looked like Max,</i>

281
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:57,845
<i>and he should be</i>
<i>the youngest ever world champion.</i>

282
00:19:57,925 --> 00:19:59,645
<i>Those things aren't lost on us.</i>

283
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:20,925
<i>Welcome to the last Grand Prix</i>
<i>before a three-week summer break.</i>

284
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:24,245
<i>The drivers and their teams</i>
<i>are getting ready at the Hungaroring.</i>

285
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:45,685
<i>The relationship</i>
<i>with Cyril's been difficult.</i>

286
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:49,205
<i>He's an emotional guy.</i>
<i>You never know what you're gonna get.</i>

287
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:53,125
<i>Comments involving the engine has been</i>
<i>a step too far from Red Bull.</i>

288
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:55,125
<i>The red line crossed.</i>

289
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:02,885
<i>We are racing in Budapest.</i>

290
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:06,805
<i>Verstappen immediately</i>
<i>from seventh up to fifth.</i>

291
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:11,765
<i>Oh! Ricciardo!</i>

292
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:13,245
Oh!

293
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:16,565
<i> Ericsson just careered</i>
<i>into the side of Ricciardo there.</i>

294
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:19,565
- <i>Daniel...</i>
<i>- I dunno if there's damage.</i>

295
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,205
- <i>Stay out for now. Stay out.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

296
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:25,365
<i>Sergio Perez going past as well.</i>

297
00:21:26,005 --> 00:21:27,845
<i>Fucking Force India passed me.</i>

298
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:30,005
<i>There's no way he keeps that spot.</i>

299
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:31,845
<i>Okay, get focused.</i>

300
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:36,125
<i>Daniel, let's get going.</i>
<i>We are staying out. Stay out. Let's go.</i>

301
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:38,925
<i>- Understood.</i>
<i>- You know what to do.</i>

302
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:39,925
<i>Okay.</i>

303
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:42,605
<i>Daniel</i> <i>Ricciardo, with</i>
<i>a little bit of damage from the start,</i>

304
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:44,365
<i>now down in sixteenth.</i>

305
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:47,485
<i>It's very difficult to overtake</i>
<i>on the Hungaroring.</i>

306
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:51,285
<i>Ricciardo is making a move</i>
<i>and he's got past Perez.</i>

307
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:52,365
<i>Next up is Vandoorne.</i>

308
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,685
<i>Past Vandoorne.</i>

309
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:59,085
<i>Ricciardo ducking and weaving.</i>

310
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,845
<i>And he breezes past Fernando Alonso.</i>

311
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:08,125
<i>Ricciardo really is one of</i>
<i>the best overtakers in the business.</i>

312
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:10,965
- <i>Next one ahead... Hülkenberg.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

313
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:14,005
<i> Ricciardo now has</i>
<i>two Renaults to overtake.</i>

314
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:15,765
<i>The first is Nico Hülkenberg.</i>

315
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:21,685
<i>Oh, and that is spectacular stuff.</i>
<i>Super late on the brakes!</i>

316
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:26,805
<i>Next one, Carlos Sainz.</i>

317
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:34,165
<i>And Sainz becomes yet another victim</i>
<i>of Ricciardo in the first corner.</i>

318
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:38,405
<i>Ricciardo now up to seventh. Phenomenal.</i>

319
00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:40,565
<i>Oh, there's a problem!</i>

320
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:48,845
- <i>Mate, no power, no power.</i>
<i>- Yep. Mode one.</i>

321
00:22:49,685 --> 00:22:52,765
<i>Max Verstappen</i>
<i>in a nightmare weekend.</i>

322
00:22:52,845 --> 00:22:54,405
<i>Stop the car, please,</i>
<i>on track, Max.</i>

323
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:56,445
<i>I don't fucking care</i>
<i>if this blows up.</i>

324
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,365
- <i>Okay.</i>
<i>-  Fuck it!</i>

325
00:22:58,445 --> 00:22:59,685
<i>Stop the car, please.</i>

326
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:04,045
<i>Another power-issue-related</i>
<i>problem for Red Bull.</i>

327
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:05,645
Piece of shit!

328
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:07,885
<i>Fuck! What a fucking joke</i>

329
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:10,485
<i>all the fucking time</i>
<i>with this shit, honestly. </i>

330
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:16,005
<i>Okay, Daniel, that last lap,</i>
<i>you were the quickest on track.</i>

331
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:16,965
<i>Yes.</i>

332
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:19,005
<i>Ricciardo is flying.</i>

333
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:23,645
<i>All over the back of Kevin Magnussen</i>
<i>in the Haas.</i>

334
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,685
<i>Ricciardo's trying to go</i>
<i>the long way round.</i>

335
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:30,725
<i>And he's pulled it off!</i>
<i>Another great move!</i>

336
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:36,005
<i>Here's another place for Ricciardo.</i>

337
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:40,165
<i>He's fought back from sixteenth</i>
<i>up to fifth, very impressive.</i>

338
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,925
<i>Valtteri Bottas now ahead of him.</i>

339
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:49,365
<i>Bottas covers the inside.</i>

340
00:23:49,445 --> 00:23:51,725
<i>Ricciardo has to go</i>
<i>the long way around.</i>

341
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,365
<i>Oh! And they touch!</i>

342
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:56,605
<i>Contact between Bottas and Ricciardo.</i>

343
00:23:57,965 --> 00:24:01,045
<i>Bottas just careered into the side</i>
<i>of the Australian.</i>

344
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:05,165
<i>There's massive damage</i>
<i>on the side of that Red Bull.</i>

345
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:15,685
<i>Bottas just locked up</i>
<i>and went into you.</i>

346
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:17,965
- <i>Yes.</i>
<i>- You are now starting the last lap.</i>

347
00:24:18,045 --> 00:24:19,485
- <i>Okay.</i>
<i>- You can still get him.</i>

348
00:24:22,365 --> 00:24:24,125
<i>Ricciardo goes for it again.</i>

349
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,925
<i>And he overtakes Bottas.</i>

350
00:24:39,805 --> 00:24:44,285
<i> With all that chaos behind,</i>
<i>it's been an easy race for Lewis Hamilton.</i>

351
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:47,325
<i>A commanding victory</i>
<i>for Hamilton and Mercedes,</i>

352
00:24:47,405 --> 00:24:49,685
<i>winning the Hungarian Grand Prix.</i>

353
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:52,885
<i>Ricciardo recovers to fourth place.</i>

354
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,045
<i>Well done, Daniel.</i>
<i>Very strong drive.</i>

355
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,565
<i>- Some fantastic passing moves there.</i>
<i>-  Cheers, guys.</i>

356
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,565
<i>It's just a good feeling</i>
<i>when you've done your best,</i>

357
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:12,045
<i>knowing that I've still got it</i>
<i>and proving it to people.</i>

358
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:15,285
<i>Renault disappointing</i>
<i>in ninth and twelfth.</i>

359
00:25:15,365 --> 00:25:19,085
<i>And now over a hundred points</i>
<i>behind Red Bull in the championship.</i>

360
00:25:26,445 --> 00:25:28,405
<i>We know</i>
<i>that the second part of the season's</i>

361
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,405
<i>going to be extremely intense...</i>

362
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,885
Very tight against cars around us,

363
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,085
which right now are more competitive

364
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:38,125
and we need to change
the way that we are doing things

365
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,085
if we want to have any chance
to fight against them.

366
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:43,325
We had a good meeting last week,

367
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:47,525
and I'm pleased to announce to you
that we will have an increase

368
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:49,605
in the financial support
from next year

369
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:52,805
that we materialize in an extra budget.

370
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,365
<i>We have a strategy.</i>
<i>We have a plan.</i>

371
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:04,685
<i>We need to see that people respect us.</i>

372
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:07,925
<i>We are not going to be intimidated,</i>
<i>full stop.</i>

373
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:19,125
<i> I've been on holiday</i>
<i>for two weeks.</i>

374
00:26:19,205 --> 00:26:22,285
<i>So, I've been training the last few days,</i>
<i>getting back into it.</i>

375
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:26,525
<i>I just thought about a lot of things</i>
<i>this year and contract talks.</i>

376
00:26:26,605 --> 00:26:28,085
<i>What am I gonna do next?</i>

377
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:31,885
<i>Red Bull's confident that next year</i>
<i>it's gonna be great.</i>

378
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,325
<i>But Honda, they haven't yet</i>
<i>proven themselves.</i>

379
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:36,405
<i>I don't know.</i>

380
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:44,685
It's busy. It's been busy
for several months.

381
00:26:45,565 --> 00:26:49,765
<i> Without Red Bull, Daniel</i>
<i>would not be in the position he is now.</i>

382
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:53,605
<i>There is a significant</i>
<i>amount of loyalty there.</i>

383
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,925
<i>You have to be respectful of that.</i>

384
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:06,405
<i>-</i>How's the season?
-Good.

385
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:08,205
-Yeah?
-Good, yeah.

386
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:10,245
-Bits we could have been better, but...
-Yeah.

387
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:12,405
Yeah, we're nine races in.
We've won three of them.

388
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:18,365
<i>This is the best driver pairing</i>
<i>that we've had in our history.</i>

389
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:21,285
<i>Daniel's contract's</i>
<i>been talked about since preseason.</i>

390
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:24,765
<i>And I'm confident that we'll manage</i>
<i>to get things resolved.</i>

391
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:35,685
<i>I've thoroughly enjoyed watching</i>
<i>his development the last ten years.</i>

392
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:40,325
<i>He's come through the ranks,</i>
<i>as a member of the junior program.</i>

393
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:43,565
<i>As soon as he got into</i>
<i>a Red Bull car,</i>

394
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,285
<i>he never stopped overtaking people.</i>

395
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:52,365
<i> Seven Grand Prix victories</i>
<i>and over twenty podiums,</i>

396
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:55,685
<i>all achieved in Red Bull racing cars.</i>

397
00:27:57,805 --> 00:28:00,005
<i>Personally, I view him as a good friend.</i>

398
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:13,645
<i>I'm trying to negotiate terms</i>
<i>with Red Bull.</i>

399
00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:17,045
<i>I feel I've been loyal up until now.</i>

400
00:28:30,565 --> 00:28:34,045
<i>A deal with Red Bull, it's all in front</i>
<i>of me now, like, this is it.</i>

401
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:36,205
<i>All I've gotta do is sign</i>
<i>the piece of paper.</i>

402
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:38,085
<i>Okay.</i>

403
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:41,565
Hmm.

404
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:46,525
<i>What if I just break free</i>
<i>and-- and make a statement?</i>

405
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:50,765
<i>Red Bull, I've been there</i>
<i>since I was 18, I think.</i>

406
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:56,445
<i>Now I have a chance to be an adult</i>
<i>and walk into a team as an adult.</i>

407
00:28:57,365 --> 00:28:58,725
My heart's going.

408
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:11,005
<i>I've decided to leave Red Bull</i>

409
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:15,685
<i>and I'll be joining Renault for 2019.</i>

410
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:27,645
<i>At times, I've found myself frustrated.</i>

411
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,045
<i>I just felt I needed something different.</i>

412
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:41,245
<i>I like new challenges</i>
<i>and kind of having a fresh start.</i>

413
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:01,365
<i>Hang on a minute, Daniel</i>
<i>Ricciardo is not re-signing for Red Bull.</i>

414
00:30:01,445 --> 00:30:04,205
<i>He's going to Renault.</i>
<i>Were they expecting it?</i>

415
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,765
<i>No, it definitely caught them out.</i>

416
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,125
Nice morning.

417
00:30:26,765 --> 00:30:29,485
-Maybe we will go the normal way.
-Yeah, do you wanna-- I was gonna say.

418
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:30,685
You can sneak, but we'll go...

419
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:32,365
Otherwise you sneak through the paddock--

420
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:33,965
-Yeah. Nah, I will.
-That's maybe not--

421
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,045
-Let's take it all on the chin.
-Yeah.

422
00:30:44,085 --> 00:30:46,085
All right. Where is the conference?

423
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:47,765
The top end.

424
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,765
Oh, it's not that crazy.

425
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:05,525
Cyril.

426
00:31:05,605 --> 00:31:08,485
He needs a driver and an engine.

427
00:31:10,845 --> 00:31:11,805
Yeah.

428
00:31:16,805 --> 00:31:18,725
So have you got money
to spend on your engine,

429
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:21,525
-now you've spent it all on your driver?
-We've got plenty of money.

430
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:34,045
It's kind of weird.
Like, super weird.

431
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:35,925
Yeah.

432
00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:38,085
There's a bit of an-- Is it--
What's the-- Airy?

433
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:40,925
-Eerie. Eerie.
-Eerie? Eerie atmosphere?

434
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:44,525
Did something else happen this morning
that I don't know about?

435
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:45,845
Well...

436
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,365
It's gonna be weird,

437
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:51,565
but somewhat exciting.

438
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:53,685
I think it's a good move.

439
00:31:55,525 --> 00:31:58,645
I'm leaving sufficient space for Max.

440
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:08,685
A question for Christian.
Given the loss of Daniel,

441
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:11,685
it's obviously very significant.
Is there any added frustration

442
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,765
in losing him to an organization

443
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:16,445
of which you've been
very publicly critical?

444
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:17,965
Um...

445
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:21,125
Of course it was a surprise.

446
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:25,445
Having had everything in front of him,
that he wanted and had required,

447
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:28,525
financially, uh, et cetera, et cetera.

448
00:32:29,085 --> 00:32:30,845
Well, I suppose
the whole process with Daniel,

449
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:34,365
so long as he's comfortable looking
at himself in the mirror

450
00:32:34,445 --> 00:32:36,885
with the choices that he's made,
you have to respect that.

451
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:43,005
We've had random discussion,
jokes with Daniel since a while.

452
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:47,165
Uh, it would be hard to put
an exact date on the first joke

453
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:49,725
about this this type of switch.

454
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:51,405
Renault can afford pretty much anything.

455
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:54,565
Renault is the largest car maker
in Formula One, full stop.

456
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:58,085
He bought into the project
and made his decision.

457
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:01,685
Thank you.

458
00:33:06,725 --> 00:33:09,085
<i>And the knock-on effects</i>
<i>of Ricciardo moving to Renault</i>

459
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:11,525
<i>means Carlos Sainz will lose his seat.</i>

460
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:18,045
Press conference.
We know what they're talking about.

461
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:21,405
Mmm...

462
00:33:21,485 --> 00:33:25,125
Um... you know what's gonna be
asked, so it's all straightforward.

463
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:29,805
Is there anything in particular you guys
don't want or want to say?

464
00:33:30,245 --> 00:33:32,685
This year, I wanna do the best on track.

465
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:36,925
My focus is Spa this weekend.
Next weekend, my focus is Monza.

466
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:40,205
I want you to cry.
I want you to be really sad.

467
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,605
Kind of just say you're gonna
miss us so much.

468
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:45,085
Okay, I'll try.

469
00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:49,165
Thank you.

470
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:52,245
- See you. Bye!
- Bye!

471
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:53,605
Later.

472
00:34:05,245 --> 00:34:09,325
<i>Now, with Red Bull, it'll be awkward.</i>

473
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:13,085
<i>I'll expect to be isolated.</i>

474
00:34:16,005 --> 00:34:18,685
<i>People are shocked</i>
<i>in some quarters by the decision.</i>

475
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,965
<i>But I think it comes down</i>
<i>to where you feel wanted.</i>

476
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,445
<i>We had a private meeting</i>
<i>with Renault,</i>

477
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,725
<i>and they walked us through</i>
<i>what was coming.</i>

478
00:34:31,245 --> 00:34:33,845
<i>It really showed you</i>
<i>the might of a manufacturer.</i>

479
00:34:34,245 --> 00:34:38,605
<i>Their ultimate goal, to be</i>
<i>a world-championship-winning team again,</i>

480
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:40,365
<i>and they have the pedigree for that.</i>

481
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:44,365
<i>Is he making the right career choice?</i>

482
00:34:44,445 --> 00:34:47,845
<i>In the end, my assumption is</i>
<i>he was running from a fight.</i>

483
00:34:49,205 --> 00:34:50,925
<i>That's the way it feels to me.</i>

484
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:02,605
<i>Always look ahead.</i>

485
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:05,365
<i>Focus on going forwards,</i>
<i>not backwards.</i>

486
00:35:05,445 --> 00:35:10,685
<i>Our goal is not just to beat Renault.</i>
<i>Our goal is to try and be world champions.</i>

487
00:35:14,485 --> 00:35:17,325
<i>It's a very dangerous sport,</i>
<i>and it will always be.</i>

488
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:20,645
<i>Confidence level goes down</i>
<i>when you have a crash like that.</i>

489
00:35:20,725 --> 00:35:22,805
Jules Bianchi has died...

490
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:26,125
<i>This year, his godson, Charles</i>
<i>Leclerc, made his Formula One debut.</i>

491
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:29,005
<i>The bigger teams are now</i>
<i>putting their faith in younger drivers.</i>

492
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,325
<i>Wow, look at that.</i>

493
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:32,925
<i>- LeClerc round the outside!</i>
- Yes!

494
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,205
<i>For Marcus,</i>
<i>it's a little hard to take.</i>

495
00:35:35,285 --> 00:35:37,685
<i>LeClerc is right on his tail now.</i>

496
00:35:37,765 --> 00:35:40,005
I've always dreamed
to be part of Ferrari.

497
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:43,245
<i>Charles has a mission to do</i>
<i>what Jules should have done.</i>
