Oh, thank God, I smell coffee.

41
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,520
今早一起来就诸事...
This morning has gotten off to a bit of a rocky...

42
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,040
如恐怖电影一般
Horror Picture Show.

43
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,350
你对你的脸做了什么
What did you do to your face?

44
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,970
涂了点眼影  让我眼睛更突出
Just a little color, to make my eyes pop.

45
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,050
你眼球现在也吓"突出"了
Like yours are now.

46
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,950
现在是我们发现爸爸想变性的时候吗
Is this how we find out you're transitioning?

47
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,160
请别选择年轻女生的名字
Oh, please don't pick a young name.

48
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,920
这世界不需要个50岁的杰思敏
The world doesn't need a 50-year-old Jasmine.

49
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,600
相信我  上镜时看起来会很正常
Trust me, this'll look completely normal on camera.

50
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,350
刚收到的消息  我要上新闻了
This just in -- I'm gonna be on the news.

51
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,220
他们在做房地产市场的报道
They're doing a segment on the real-estate market,

52
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,560
而我是当地专家
and I'm their local expert.

53
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,280
交给你了  克莱尔
Back to you, Claire.

54
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,520
你上次上新闻造成的不良影响还困扰着我
I'm still reeling from the last time you were on the news.

55
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,580
人们找到了各种各样的方式来避暑
And while people have found all sorts of ways to beat the heat,

56
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,550
一名当地人用了"头脑"
one local man is using his head. 

57
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,060
{\an8}菲尔·邓菲  当地居民

58
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,430
外面很热吗  我没发现啊
Is it warm out? I hadn't noticed.

59
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,810
看来我得重新化妆[申请]了
Looks like I need to re-apply.

60
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,150
进小丑大学吗
To clown college?

61
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,990
海莉  跟他去
Haley, go with him.

62
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,740
确保他把脸上的东西全擦掉
Make sure he gets all that stuff off his face.

63
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,800
我会带上厨房纸巾跟玻璃刮
I'll pack paper towels and a squeegee.

64
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,150
我怎么回事啊  我觉得好晕啊[毛绒绒]
Ugh. What is wrong with me? I feel so fuzzy.

65
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,420
别太苛责自己了  只是手毛而已
Oh, stop being so hard on yourself. It's just arm hair.

66
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,340
我填不出这题纵横字谜
I can't figure out this crossword puzzle.

67
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,710
我觉得接吻病让我的脑子笨了
I -- I think mono turned my mind to mush.

68
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,280
线索是什么  也许我能帮忙
What's the clue? Maybe I can help.

69
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,250
谢谢  妈妈  笑一下感觉挺好的
Thanks, mom. Feels good to laugh.

70
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,330
有什么好笑的
What is so funny?

71
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,220
我是个博学的大学毕业生
I am a well-read college graduate.

72
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,650
我觉得我能解纵横字谜
I think I'm capable of doing a crossword puzzle.

73
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,910
好  教授
Okay, professor.

74
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,010
三个字  阿基米德的感叹
Six-letter word, Archimedes' exclamation.

75
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,100
我现在不喜欢你了
I don't like you right now.

76
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,670
我为什么想不出来啊
Ugh. Why can't I get this?

77
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,370
阿基米德的感叹
Archimedes' exclamation.

78
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,830
"找到啦"[这就是答案]
Eureka.

79
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,990
我们也许永远不知道那条线索的答案
We may never know the answer to that clue,

80
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,120
但这让我意识到  我在拼字游戏上
but it made me realize this was my chance

81
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,990
打败艾丽克斯的机会来了
to finally beat Alex at Scrabble.

82
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,570
我从未打败过她
I have never beaten her.

83
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,080
而她不是太有品的赢家
She's not the nicest winner.

84
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,830
我赢了  你输了
I win, you lose!

85
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,120
我赢了  我赢了  你输了
I win! I win! You lose! ?

86
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,600
赢赢赢
Win, win, win, win, win, win, win!

87
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,260
输输输
Lose, lose, lose, lose, lose!

88
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,910
-谢谢你的造餐  -不用谢  亲爱的
-Thank you for bweakfast. -You're welcome, sweetie.

89
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,460
你听到了吗  "造餐"
Did you hear that? "Bweakfast."

90
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,450
幸亏我们带他去言语治疗了
It's a good thing that we're taking him to speech therapy.

91
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,860
我希望大家明白他说的每一句话
I want everybody to understand every single thing he says.

92
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,230
你的"赖油蛋简"上想加橘子酱吗
Do you want marmalade on your brioche toast?

93
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,890
完全听不懂
Not a clue.

94
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,640
你将说话问题扼杀于摇篮中是正确的
You're probably right to nip that speech problem in the bud.

95
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,440
米奇尔口齿不清  而我们放任不管
Mitchell had a lisp we let slide.

96
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,060
现在一辈子都在想  要是管了会怎样
Now we got a lifetime of "What if?"

97
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,390
你这话太无礼了
That is so offensive.

98
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,440
口齿不清不会让你变同性恋
A lisp doesn't make you gay.

99
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,670
当同性恋才会让你口齿不清
Being gay makes you lisp.

100
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,050
我完成了朱丽亚音乐学院的申请视频
Well, I finished the video for my Juilliard application.

101
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,600
我觉得他们会为之虎躯一震
I think they're going to be blown away.

102
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,870
艺校  反正以后没工作还能去路边卖橘子
Art school, huh? Well, you can always sell oranges by the side of the road.

103
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,650
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

104
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,190
去上艺术学校吧  做个编剧
Go to your art school, be a playwright.

105
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,930
谢谢
Thank you.

106
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,900
只要你愿意  在这里住多久都行
You can live here as long as you want. 

107
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,740
* 一个有艺术气质  博览群书  父母离异的孩子 *
* How does an artsy, well-read, child of divorce *

108
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,440

* 在被人遗忘的地方 *
* In the middle of a forgotten plot *

110
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,650
* 是在郊区里  他自信满满... *
* In suburbia with confidence and... *

111
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,770
你是从音乐剧《汉密尔顿》里抄的  对吧
You copied that from that play "Hamilton," right?

112
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,290
"抄"这个词用得不合适
I'm not sure "copied" is the word.

113
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,450
应该说是致敬
It's more of an homage.

114
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,980
我大概两周前在"杰说"里致敬过了
Well, I homaged it about two weeks on "Jay Talking."

115
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,340
你看了那一集  对吧
You saw that episode, right?

116
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,120
-好吧  -我用"大米布丁"
- Okay. - I rhymed "Rice pudding"

117
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,480
和演员"库巴·古丁"押韵
with "Cuba Gooding."

118
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,360
顺便说一句  两者都很美味
Both delicious, by the way.

119
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,490
天啊
Oh, good God.

120
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,270
有几千个恶搞版《汉密尔顿》的视频
There are thousands of "Hamilton" parodies,

121
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,200
一半都是大学申请视频
and half of them are college applications.

122
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,490
没事  孩子  也许有百老汇的纽约人
It's okay, Papi. Maybe the people in New York

123
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,590
没听说过音乐剧《汉密尔顿》呢
haven't heard about "Hamilton."

124
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,920
提早申请的截止日期就在明天了
The deadline for early admission is tomorrow.

125
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,760
在那之前我绝对做不出更好的影片了
I'll never come up with something great by then.

126
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,320
你会的  我会帮忙
Yes, you will, and I'll help.

127
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,730
你愿意帮我吗
You'd do that for me?

128
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,480
为你做什么都行  孩子
Anything for you, kid.

129
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,440
我得让这孩子成功离家读书
I got to get this kid out of the house.

130
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,050
他的那些疯狂怪癖
All his crazy quirks.

131
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,540
越远越好
The farther away, the better.

132
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,070
我一直在家里放海上学校的宣传册诱惑他
I keep leaving brochures around for schools at sea.

133
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,070
{\an8}在帆船上环球航行一年  在海上读书的学校

134
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,550
好了  孩子  补充碳水化合物  
All right, carb up, buddy.

135
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,950
干掉这些煎饼
Tackle these pancakes

136
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,650
如球赛到拼死一战的阶段一样
like it's fourth and goal on the one-yard line.

137
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,310
说得好  教练
Good one, Coach.

138
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,810
用橄榄球术语说事情让生活更有趣了
Life's more fun when you put stuff in football terms.

139
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,040
煎饼  好棒
Pancakes, yay!

140
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,560
实际上家里没有煎饼了
Oh, uh, we're actually out of those.

141
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,580
你可以吃剩下的
You can have the rest.

142
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,500
不  我在里面加了一些运动营养品
No, no! We put some performance supplements in there

143
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,900
你这种小姑娘吃了要出问题
that could mess with you as a lady.

144
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,770
还剩什么能吃的吗
What else is there?

145
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,470
我晚点会去商店
Well, I'm going to the store later.

146
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,100
这之前你可以吃点水果
In the meantime, you can have some fruit.

147
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,640
那是真的吗  我还以为只是装饰品
That's real? I thought it was just for show.

148
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,990
自从我的明星球员德怀特的父亲
My star player Dwight has been living with us

149
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,720
转到佛罗里达州驻扎后  他就跟我们住
ever since his father was transferred to an army base in Florida.

150
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,870
他父亲在为我们国家做贡献
He's doing his part for our country,

151
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,370
所以我觉得我也能为我们球队做点贡献
so I thought I could do my part for our team.

152
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,560
有谁能说哪一种贡献更伟大呢
Who's to say who the bigger hero is.

153
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,150
我能  他更伟大
I will. He is.

154
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,190
我得提前半小时起床用洗手间
I've had to wake up a half hour earlier to use the bathroom --

155
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,450
军人更伟大
The soldier is the hero.

156
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,930
我们该怎么办呢
Ugh. What are we gonna do?

157
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,160
亲爱的  我知道
Oh, sweetie, I know.

158
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,910
-准备好了吗  -是的
- Ready to go? - Yes! Yes!

159
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,710
德怀特要和我去购物
Dwight and I are going shopping.

160
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,690
他要帮我挑双帅气的鞋
He's gonna help me pick out some cool new kicks.

161
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,020
就像李察·基尔带茱莉亚·罗伯茨去购物那样
Like Richard Gere taking Julia Roberts to the store.

162
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,280
没错  我们昨晚看了电影《风月俏佳人》
That is right. We watched "Pretty Woman" last night.

163
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,530
去购物的同时带我去吃饭不是挺好吗
I guess that would've been my window to eat something.

164
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,390
好吧  别动  你的眼窝非常深
Okay, hold still. You have very deep-set eyes.

165
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,570
大学的时候他们称我为小浣熊
In college, they called my "The Raccoon".

166
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,340
不过那也有可能是因为我
Although, that could've been because I climbed in

167
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,120
从狗洞钻进学生会的楼偷吃了一个派
through the doggy door at Zeta house and stole a pie.

168
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,790
天哪
My God.

169
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,230
我太美了
I'm beautiful.

170
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,080
亲爱的  你能靠这个吃饭了
Honey, you could do this for a living.

171
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,150
我有想过的
I have thought about it.

172
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,330
从卢克三岁开始我就经常在真人身上练习了
I've been practicing on people since Luke was 3.

173
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,510
我勒个去
Mo-o-o-o-ther nature.

174
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,950
你肯定不相信自己背后站的是谁
You're not gonna believe who's behind you.

175
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,560
-雷纳·向恩  -谁啊
- Rainer Shine! - Who?

176
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,770
天气预报员  你都不看新闻的吗
The weatherman. Don't you watch the news?

177
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,270
加油站等加油时看
Yeah, at the gas station.

178
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,950
他过来了  你赶紧...
He's coming this way. Just...

179
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,420
你要注意了
Whoa, careful now.

180
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,700
我的合同里有规定
There's a stipulation in my contract --

181
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,560
我必须是这里最帅的男人
I have to be the best-looking guy here.

182
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,020
不要调戏人家啦
Stop it.

183
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,090
雷纳·向恩
Rainer Shine.

184
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,740
真的很高兴见到你
It's, just, s-so nice to meet you.

185
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,010
那不是你的真名对吧
That isn't your real name, is it?

186
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,780
我就为你们揭开谜底吧
Ow, I'm not letting you behind that curtain.

187
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,390
的确是我真名  这牙也的确是真牙
That's my name, and these are my teeth.

188
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,270
我叫菲尔·邓菲
My name's Phil Dunphy.

189
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,790
节目有个房地产环节邀请我来
I'm doing a little real-estate segment.

190
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,110
有可能会变成常驻
Could become a regular thing.

191
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,590
这是我的化妆师及女儿  海莉·邓菲
This is my make-up artist/daughter, Haley Dunphy.

192
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,120
幸会  我觉得
It is a pleasure. You know, I think

193
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,660
是你帮我邻居桃瑞丝·雅各布卖的房子
you sold my neighbor's house -- Doris Jacobs.

194
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,140
白[人]  上世纪中[年]建成  "后庭"很大的吗
Uh, white, mid-century, big back porch?

195
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,960
就是她
That's her.

196
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,310
我想去洗个手  能告诉我洗手间在哪吗
I need to wash my hands. Where's the restroom?

197
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,300
当然  你穿过走廊
Oh, of course. You're gonna want to

198
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,870
推开那扇巨大的双开门
go down that hallway, push through the big double doors.

199
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,700
你会看到旁边有一些通风口
You're gonna see some air vents on the way there.

200
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,040
经过空气冷却系统[冷气团]就是了
It's just past that cold-air system.

201
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,950
带件外套
Bring a sweater.

202
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,000
那一带温度可能会有些低
It tends to get a little chilly in that neck of the woods.

203
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,700
跟你聊天很开心  菲尔
Nice shooting the breeze with you, Phil.

204
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,420
我也是  听我说
You too. Hey, uh, listen.

205
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,210
我知道可能有点突兀
This might be kind weird,

206
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,220
不过你想跟我去喝一杯吗
but would you ever want to grab a beer?

207
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,130
当然  感觉会很有意思
Sure. Sounds like fun.

208
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,140
好的
All right!

209
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,730
给  打三次电话给我
Here you go. Oh! C-- call me three times.

210
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,350
开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

211
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,110
一次就够了  如果你今晚有空的话
Just call me once. Tonight -- if you're around.

212
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,080
我看看能不能把你挤进我未来十天预测中
I'll see if I can squeeze you into my 10-day outlook.

213
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,990
好吧
Okay.

214
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,820
百闻不如一见啊
Do meet your heroes.

215
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,330
你准备得怎么样了
What have you got?

216
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,730
有什么能让朱丽亚音乐学院为你转身
What says to Juilliard, "I'm your guy"?

217
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,820
我盯着摄像头说
I look straight into the camera and say,

218
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,930
"莫里哀  贝克特  迪尔加多"
"Moliee, Beckett, Delgado."

219
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,930
{\an8}前两者都是伟大戏剧编剧与作家

220
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,660
没错  把我的名字加进去是很大胆
Yes, it's bold to include my own name,

221
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,800
但人类第一次在白纸上写字也是如此大胆啊
but so is the sheer act of putting pen to paper.

222
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,810
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding, right?

223
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,710
怎么了  哪里不对
Why? What's wrong?

224
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,380
这太自恋自傲自大了
It's smug and privileged and precious.

225
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,050
没有哪间艺校会喜欢的
No art school's gonna want that.

226
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,630
好吧  那这样呢
Okay. How about this?

227
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,480
我们打开一张白纸
We open on a blank sheet of paper.

228
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,480
在莫扎特的背景乐里  我们突然看到一滴血
Under a Mozart fugue, we suddenly see a drop of blood.

229
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,300
是录取委员会在割腕吗
Is it the admissions committee slitting their wrists?

230
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,290
好吧
Fine.

231
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,150
年代是在18...
The year is 18--

232
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,600
不  你找错方向了
No! You're on the wrong track here.

233
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,360
喜欢艺术的小屁孩儿们
They're gonna get a million applications

234
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,990
给他们寄了几百万份申请
from artsy little snots.

235
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,370
你必须与众不同
You've got to stand out.

236
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,500
当所有人都向左  你得挖地道
When everybody else zigs, you've got to zoink.

237
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,780
正常不是应该向右吗
Isn't it "Zag"?

238
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,440
所以啊
Exactly.

239
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,690
-你好  -我们回来了
- Hi. - We're back.

240
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,100
我不知道你们怎么回事  但我很喜欢
I don't know what this is, but I love it.

241
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,420
前门外有泥  德怀特坚持要抱我跨过
There's mud out front, so Dwight insisted.

242
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,470
好像这种帅鞋弄脏之后就不帅了
Apparently, they're not cool after you get them dirty.

243
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,330
昨晚我们还看了《军官与绅士》
Last night, we also watch "An Officer and a Gentleman."

244
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,860
没错  他把我举到"上面属于我的地方"
Yeah, he lift me up where I belong.

245
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,350
{\an8}电影《军官与绅士》的主题曲名
片中有女主被男主新娘抱到空中的名场景

246
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,350

给你  我又带了些酒瓶
Here. I brought by some more liquor bottles

251
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,800

252
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,330
什...什么设计
Wha-- wh -- what project?

253
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,790
不知道  我发现她在我车库里翻翻找找
I don't know. I caught her going through my garbage,

254
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,510
她说她需要酒瓶
and she said she needed liquor bottles.

255
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,340
太奇怪了
Well, that's weird.

256
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,740
总之告诉她我明天会再拿几个给她
Anyway, tell her I'll have a couple more for her tomorrow.

257
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,790
好  拜拜  保重哦
Okay. Bye-bye. Take care.

258
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,950
以后不能再请她照顾莉莉了
She can't baby sit anymore.

259
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,930
什么设计
What project?

260
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,870
不知道
I don't know.

261
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,300
我们有麻烦了
We've got a problem here.

262
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,490
看看我在德怀特床底下发现了什么
Look what I found under Dwight's bed.

263
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,100

264
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,440
难得他给我们家带来那么多正能量呢
He brought such a great energy to the house.

265

给我几秒时间想想怎么做
I just need a minute to process this.

272
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,030
电视台有人还说我天生适合干这个呢
Well, someone there said I was a real natural.

273
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,350
是谁来着....

278
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,650
不可能真叫这个...
That cannot be the actual name --

279
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,190
相当于他们的奥斯卡
It's their Oscars.

280
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,690
反正我给了他我的号码
Anyway, I gave him my number.

我的牌里有三个D了
I have, like, three D's.

290
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,340

我知道他的愚蠢是从哪遗传的了
Ugh. I see where he gets it from.

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,810
他想出答案后再叫我起床
Wake me when it's my turn.

297
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,490
还以为我能趁他病  要她命  赢她一把
I thought I could finally beat her because she's sick.

298

是啊  我也是
Yeah. So do I.

00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,980
换牌作弊吗
Cheating?

301
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,800
我们真要出这招吗
Are we really doing this?

302
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,670
我们得打击打击你姐的嚣张气焰
That smug sister of yours needs to be taken down a peg.

303
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,320

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,960
红色海盗船  红色海盗船  红色海盗船
Red rover, red rover, red rover.

312
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,570
抱歉  就是有时候我觉得
I am sorry. It's just sometimes I feel

313
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,520
我的口音有点...
like my accent gets a little

314
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,170
会影响到弗汉希欧·乔瑟夫
and it's gonna rub off on Fulgencio Joseph.

315
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,080
你不该怪自己啊
Well, you shouldn't blame yourself,

316
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,790
如果我没听错你说的话
if that's what you just said.

317
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,080
其实我这里还有一些练习可以帮到你
I actually have some exercises that can help you.

318
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,970
比如炮兵怕把标兵碰
Like Betty bought a bit of butter,

319
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,880
标兵怕碰炮兵炮
but found the butter bitter.

320
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,690
炮兵怕把飘乒蹦
Betty bought a bit 'a bootie,

321
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,430
标乒怕蹦抱兵抱
but da bootie bittah.

322
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,160
这一带治安不太好啊  杰
This is a pretty bad neighborhood, Jay.

323
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,440
我们要讲述的故事是这样的
This is the story that we're telling --

324
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,450
好斗的小孩  出身贫困
scrappy young kid, born into poverty

325
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,100
面临着种种困境
with the deck stacked against him.

326
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,430
我富到能补习书法呢
I have a calligraphy tutor.

327
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,870
下车  我要开始拍了
Hop out. I want to start shooting.

328
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,070
你就坐在车上吗
Hey, you're staying in car?

329
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,290
我一边开车一边拍你啊
I'm gonna drive alongside and film you.

330
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,090
快去吧  非常安全啦
Go ahead. It's perfectly safe.

331
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,300
你刚锁车门了吗
Hey. Did you just lock the door?

332
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,670
这车一关门就会自动锁上
The car does that automatically.

333
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,270
给你  试试这顶发网
Here. Try on this hair net.

334
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,900
这是不是有点太浮夸了啊
Isn't this a little over the top?

335
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,700
你觉得电影《为人师表》太浮夸了吗
Was "Stand and Deliver" over the top?

336
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,570
对啊  的确
Yes, it was.

337
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,730
行  那你就表现出生气的样子
Fine, then act angry, like you're sick of

338
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,370
像你受够了总被白人颐指气使
taking orders from the white man.

339
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,670
这个有经验我能演
Yeah, that I can do.

340
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,370
沿着那堵墙走  然后读台词
Walk along that wall, read from your script.

341
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,220
走吧
Go.

342
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,950
大家好
Hola!

343
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,580
"欢迎来到被我称为家的街区
"Welcome to the streets I call home.

344
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,750
世道艰险  所以我得更硬汉一些
It's tough out here, so I've had to be tougher.

345
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,870
因为在这个暴力当钱用
Because in a place where violence is currency

346
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,260
伤痛为好友的地方"
and pain is your best friend..."

347
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,400
这太丢人了  求你别拍了
Okay, this is embarrassing. Please don't shoot this.

348
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,580
你表现得很好
You're doing good!

349
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,720
假装你正从墙那边爬过来
Hey, pretend like you're climbing over the wall,

350
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,520
以防你之后想说是在墨西哥拍的
in case we want to say this is Mexico.

351
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,530
不会的
Not gonna happen.

352
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,370
好吧
Fine.

353
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,200
给你几罐喷漆
Here's some spray-paint.

354
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,920
用喷漆喷出你对美国佬的看法
Bubble letter me something about gringos.

355
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,600
不知道会是谁
Oh, I wonder who that could be.

356
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,220
警官你好
Oh, Officer.

357
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,290
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

358
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,420
我是来以未成年人饮酒的罪名
I'm here to arrest Dwight Bullock

359
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,940
逮捕德怀特·布洛克的
for underage drinking.

360
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,520
我们想给莉莉一个自己承认错误的机会
We wanted to give Lily a chance to come clean on her own.

361
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,110
幸亏我们有个朋友的朋友
Luckily, we have a friend of a friend

362
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,990
因为工作需要总穿着警服
who dresses as a cop for work.

363
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,210
他的工作也需要他把警服脱光
He also undresses as a cop for work.

364
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,450
记住  装作很难过就好了  知道吗
Remember, just act upset, okay?

365
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,570
好的
Okay.

366
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,570
德怀特·布洛克
Dwight Bullock.

367
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,070
我必须逮捕你
I have to arrest you.

368
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,250
因为你坏坏
You've been a bad boy.

369
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,620
但我什么都没做
But I didn't do it!

370
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,790
我是无辜的
I'm innocent!

371
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,210
我不知道为什么那个酒瓶会在我床底下
I don't know how that bottle got under the bed!

372
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,570
不用难过到这么浮夸
Now we're gonna take it down a notch.

373
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,740
伸出手来
Hold out your wrists.

374
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,150
我得带你到菊里走一趟
I've got to take you downtown.

375
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,040
德怀特  我对你太失望了
Dwight, I am very disappointed in you.

376
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,570
你不能再打橄榄球了
There's no more football.

377
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,960
你不能再上学了
No more school.

378
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,380
莉莉  在德怀特被关进监狱前
Lily, is there anything you'd like to say to Dwight

379
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,670
你有什么想对他说的吗
before he's taken to jail.

380
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,980
有吧
I guess.

381
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,030
玛莎·斯图尔特说过她利用狱中的时间
Martha Stewart said she used the prison time

382
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,180
{\an8}美国家政女王  曾因内线交易而入狱

383
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,180
来充实自己
to work on herself.

384
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,470
够了  我们知道
That is enough! W-w-we know

385
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,930
是你把酒瓶放到德怀特床下的
you put the bottle under Dwight's bed.

386
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,710
你必须现在就向他道歉
You owe him an apology this minute.

387
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,670
这不公平
It isn't fair!

388
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,510
他吃啥啥不剩  还总占着厕所
He eats everything, he's always in the bathroom,

389
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,470
你们和他一起看电影  买衣服
you're watching movies with him, shopping with him.

390
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,270
你们两个都不爱我了
And you two don't even love me anymore!

391
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,310
-莉莉  -不是那样的
- Lily! - That is not --

392
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,500
莉莉  宝贝
Lily, honey!

393
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,460
你这玩意有钥匙吗
Do you have the keys to these?

394
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,330
我通常会让雇我的人伸手到我裤裆里找
I usually let the person who hired me find it in my pants.

395
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,970
那我就入境"随俗"吧
Well, if that is the custom, I --

396
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:09,950
米奇尔你够了
Mitchell.

397
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,810
我的天  又尿啊
Oh, my God. Again?

398
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,990
膀胱有多小  头脑就有多大
Small bladder, big brain.

399
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,340
不然我们怎么会打平手
That's why we're tied.

400
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,550
给我一个T  一个L和一个W
I need a "T," An "L," And a "W."

401
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,400
T  L
"T," "L"...

402
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,420
希望她困到不会注意到
Hopefully she's too sleepy to notice that she got

403
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,990
她板子上已经有三个w了
three "W"s on her board.

404
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,990
{\an8}通常一轮游戏只会有两个w

405
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,270
另外  我想放屁
Also, can I take a pee?

406
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,610
好  要P就给你P
Yeah. Coming right up.

407
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,900
你有什么烦心事吗
Something wrong?

408
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,700
我差不多三小时前给雷纳发的短信
I texted Rainer, like, three hours ago.

409
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,870
他还没回复
He hasn't responded.

410
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,690
我相信他只是在装高冷难泡
I'm sure he's just playing hard to get.

411
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,070
这太奇怪了  我们昨晚聊得可开心了
It's just weird. We had such a great time last night.

412
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,320
我猜他肯定很忙
I bet he's busy.

413
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,000
他可是南加州的天气预报员啊
He's a weatherman in southern California.

414
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,150
他得时刻准备着
He has to be ready in case

415
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,210
万一温度猛降到"21度"以下立即报道
temperatures plunge below 70 degrees.

416
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,750
我告诉你  今晚可是有强风警告好吗
For your information, there is a wind advisory tonight.

417
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,560
说起来  我得去把风铃摘下来
In fact, I'm gonna go take down my chimes.

418
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,590
不是他吗
Not him?

419
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,000
不是  是我卖出去了幢房子
No. I sold a house.

420
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,820
他大概只是在吃晚饭而已
He's probably just having dinner.

421
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,740
他可能与佳人有约
He could be on a date.

422
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,100
他好像还挺风流的
Apparently, he's quite the player.

423
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,330
也不奇怪  哪有他撩不到的...
Makes sense. That could charm the pants off --

424
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,580
我勒个大去
What the what?!

425
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,460
爸
Hey, dad.

426
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,800
酷爹在此
There he is!

427
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,010
这是什么情况  你为什么在和他激吻
What is happening? Why are you kissing him?!

428
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,450
他晚饭时出手阔绰
He dropped some serious cash at dinner,

429
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,780
我就想  何乐而不为呢
so I figured, what the hell?

430
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,970
而你  你怎么能做出这种事
And you. How could you do this?

431
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,600
哪种事  其实我这
Do what? Actually, I'm -- I'm taking it

432
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,630
进展算慢的了  毕竟她是你女儿
kind of slow because she's your daughter.

433
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,550
对  她是我女儿  但你也能当她爸了
Yeah, she is, and she's half your age.

434
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,570
你卑鄙无耻下流
You're despicable.

435
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,630
好了  听我说一句  你好我是克莱尔
Oh, come on. Now, listen. Hi. Claire.

436
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,660
雷纳  请进  我们把话谈开
Rainer, come in. We'll just talk this out.

437
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,980
我很愿意  因为我不太明白...
I would like that because I -- I don't quite understand --

438
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,370
友情的意义吗
What friendship means?

439
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,570
菲尔  我也想把话说清楚
Look, Phil, I -- I want to figure this out,

440
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,540
但现在我不得不赶去查韦斯岭
but right now, I have to get to Chavez Ridge

441
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,780
报道这次强风事件
and cover this wind event.

442
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,720
让我告诉你
You know what?

443
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,550
我们友尽了
We're not friends.

444
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,750
你走
Go.

445
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,960
你出去
Get...

446
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,910
菲尔
Phil?

447
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,360
你太荒唐了
You're being ridiculous.

448
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,330
你真不把话说完吗
You really want to leave things like that?

449
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,050
从今以后
From now on,

450
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,310
我们只看特利西亚·田崎的天气预报
we're getting our weather from Tricia Tazaki!

451
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,380
吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮
Fred fed Ted bread.

452
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,780
不吃葡萄倒吐葡萄皮
Ted fed Fred bread.

453
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,780
你在干什么
What am I looking at?

454
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,950
乔的医生给了我几份演讲练习
Joe's doctor gave me some sp-heech exer-cises

455
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,040
来矫正我口齿不清的毛病
to help me speak more clear-ely.

456
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:30,310
但我怕我已经忘了原来怎么说话了
The problem is I fee-ear I have forgotten how I used to talk.

457
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,700
不用难过  你再差也差不过以前
Well, if it's any consolation, this isn't any worse.

458
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,060
曼尼 过来看下
Manny! Check this out.

459
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,510
我试着做了做你的视频
I think I took a stab at finishing your video essay.

460
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,340
在这个贫富差距巨大的世界
In a world divided into the haves and have-nots,

461
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,990
一名奇男子诞生了
a boy was born.

462
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,000
世界很残酷 我要变坚强
It's tough out here, so I've had to be tougher.

463
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,010
混街头  你不能相信任何人
On the streets, you can't trust anyone.

464
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,640
即便是最亲密的朋友都可能背叛你
Even your closest compadre could turn on you.

465
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,910
别开枪
Please don't shoot!

466
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,300
每天都是一场战...
Every day was a battle for your s--

467
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,460
我才不能发这个给音乐学院
I can't send this to Juilliard.

468
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,350
这都是你编的谎言
It's all lies.

469
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,990
这就对了 曼尼
That's right, Manny.

470
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,300
不要改变你自己  那样你会失去
Do not change who you are or you will lo-o-ose

471
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,180
自己的闪光点
what makes you spe-cial.

472
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,930
我的说话还这么怪吗
Am I still do-ing it?

473
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,020
这些也不全是我编的
They're not all lies.

474
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,480
你们俩给我讲过
I hear you the stories you two tell about

475
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,810
你们以前住的街区有多乱
the neighborhoods you lived in,

476
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,820
你在出租车后座上长大
growing up on the passenger seat of a cab.

477
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,730
的确  我是加入了我们专业人士成为"料"的东西
Sure, I put in what we professionals call "sizzle,"

478
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,410
但这些确实是你的亲身经历
but this is a part of who you are.

479
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,200
而且大家会更支持这种苦小子
And it's a lot easier to root for

480
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,060
而不是巧克力只吃含72%科科的富二代
than a kid who insists that 72% of his chocolate is cocoa.

481
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,660
是可可
It's "Cacao."

482
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,530
我相信他说的就是这点
I beliee-eve that is hiiis point.

483
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,050
你刚那是什么意思
What was that?

484
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,460
应该是我来问你话
How about I ask the questions.

485
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,420
你们俩什么时候谋划这次幽会的
When did you two set up this little rendezvous?

486
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,760
是趁我在节目上秒杀全场的时候吗
While I was killing it on the air?

487
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,700
他今天才给我打的电话
He called me today.

488
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,510
他怎么会有你的电话的
How'd he get your number?

489
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,780
他说是你给的
He said you gave it to him.

490
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,190
他这个大骗...
That lying sack --

491
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,700
我和我的化妆师约会了几次
Anyway, I dated my makeup girl for a while,

492
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,580
但后来她离开这城市了
but, uh, then she had to leave town.

493
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,240
我有个不情之请
Oh. Wow. Well, if -- if it's not crossing a line,

494
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,590
能把我女儿海莉的电话给你吗
can I give you my daughter Haley's number?

495
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,230
-真的吗  -真的  她现在正空窗
-Really? -Yeah, she's available,

496
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,080
而且她表达过兴趣
and she actually expressed some interest.

497
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,290
我也非常有兴趣
Well, I'm definitely interested.

498
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,430
那我们还等什么
Well, then let's make this happen.

499
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,400
菲尔·邓菲  你这人太赞了
Phil Denphy, you are the best!

500
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,210
这没啥
No.

501
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,520
我以为是让你去当化妆师
I thought it was about a makeup job.

502
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,570
我挺喜欢他的
I like him.

503
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
他是个好人
He's a good guy.

504
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,210
不  他不是好人
No, he's not.

505
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,260
他是全世界最赞的人
He's a great guy.

506
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,500
去追回他吧
Dad, run to him.

507
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,880
克莱尔  我去去就回
Claire, I'm going out!

508
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,270
认输吧  你没戏唱了
Admit it, it's over.

509
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,860
我领先你足足50分  而你只剩两个字母  
I'm head by 50 points and you have two tiles left.

510
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,980
肯定还有能拼的高分字
There's got to be something!

511
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,950
我怎么就想不出来呢
I -- ugh -- Why can't I see it?!

512
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,190
半年前我还在加州理工  现在脑子像冻住...
Six months ago, I was at Caltech, and now -- ugh -- work.

513
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,460
放轻松  宝贝
Relax, honey.

514
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,880
这只是个游戏
It's just a game.

515
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,040
如果不只这么简单呢
What if it's more than that?

516
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,390
如果是这场病让我变傻了呢
What if mono permanently changed my brain?

517
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,050
一直以来我都以智商来定位自己
I've always defined myself by my intelligence,

518
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,930
如果连这都没了  那我还算什么
and if that's gone, who am I?

519
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,880
废柴输家
A loser.

520
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,340
卢克  别胡说
Luke! No!

521
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,960
我们作弊了
We cheated.

522
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,340
我们对牌动了手脚
Luke and I messed with the tiles.

523
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,900
-什么  -就是这样  
What?! Yeah, it's just that,

524
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,200
你一直是家里的智商巅峰
you're the smartest one in the family,

525
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,270
却总是用智商羞辱我们
and you always rub it in,

526
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,970
我们也很郁闷啊
and it doesn't make us feel good.

527
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,040
我很抱歉
I am so sorry.

528
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,920
让你们这么郁闷  真不好意思
I feel terrible that I've been making you guys feel this way.

529
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,290
谢谢你坦白告诉我这些
Thank you for opening up to me about it.

530
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,740
不然我不会知道你们作弊了
Otherwise, I never would have known that you cheated,

531
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,250
这就说明
which means that...

532
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,600
我赢了你输了  我是天才你是笨蛋  
I win, you lose! I win! You lose! I win! You lose!

533
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,230
我才是赢家
I win you lose.

534
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,410
累死了
God, I'm so tired.

535
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,450
如果你想剃光她的眉毛  动手吧
If you want to shave off her eyebrows, I'm cool with that.

536
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,760
莉莉  你在做什么
Lily, honey, what're you doing?

537
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,600
好的  第一次冷战
Okay. Her first ice out.

538
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,430
态度强硬一点
Be strong.

539
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,710
莉莉
G-- Lily.

540
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,090
好了好了  听我说
All right, all right, come on.

541
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,330
你对德怀特做的事是错的  知道吗
What you did to Dwight was wrong, okay?

542
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,290
我们对你很失望
We're very disappointed in you.

543
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,340
做错事就得受罚
Yes, and there's gonna be consequences.

544
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,610
一周内不许用电子设备
No electronics for a week.

545
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,600
这点你们比较怕  我没啥所谓
That'll be worse for you than for me.

546
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,320
那就一周没有点心
No dessert.

547
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,480
你戳中我的痛处了
Okay, that hurts.

548
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,740
话虽这么说  但这件事情上
That being said, we could've handled things

549
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,610
我们也有不好
a little bit better.

550
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,670
我们应该在德怀特搬来前
We should've talked to you

551
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,210
先和你商量一下
before having Dwight move in.

552
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,780
如果我不同意他就不会搬进来吗
You mean I could have stopped it?

553
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,100
倒也不是  但如果我们知道你不乐意
Well, no, but at least we would've know how you felt,

554
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,040
我们至少可以想办法让你不这么难受
and we could've made things easier for you.

555
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,230
宝贝  全世界我最理解你的心情
Sweetie, look, I, of all people, know what it feels like

556
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,370
那种失去众人关注的感觉
to go from being the center of attention --

557
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,430
我以前还在我父母家农场时体会过
I went through it with my parents back on the farm,

558
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,680
当时他们带回家一个6斤重的
when they brought home a seven-pound

559
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,190
粉色欢乐小可爱  然后对我说
little pink bundle of joy and said,

560
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,200
"你房间以后要跟他分享..."
"You're gonna share your room --"

561
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,600
我们都知道你说的是只小粉猪
We all know it's gonna be a pig.

562
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,800
总之  他还会打呼...
Anyway, he would snore...

563
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,950
好啦  对不起我说谎了
Okay, I'm sorry I lied.

564
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,880
谢谢  你真乖
Thank you.

565
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,010
你也得跟德怀特道歉
You have to apologize to Dwight, too. 

566
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,000
我们吃饭的时候我会跟他说
I'll try to catch him in between bites.

567
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,170
我有个主意
Hey, I have an idea.

568
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,950
想一件能大家一起做的事
Let's think of something we can all do together, okay?

569
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,140
就我们四个人一起
Just the four of us.

570
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,300
你想做什么都行
Anything you want.

571
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,120
什么都可以
Absolutely anything.

572
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,320
三年前  他们给了我一次"什么都可以"
Three years ago, they gave me an "Absolutely anything,"

573
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,460
这机会我浪费在买冰棍上了
and I wasted it on a Popsicle.

574
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,990
我不会再犯这样的错误
That was not gonna happen again.

575
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,120
这真是个好有爱的派对
Well, now, this is a lovely party.

576
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,070
太美妙的下午了
It's a splendid afternoon.

577
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,990
还要茶吗
More tea?

578
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,890
不了  谢谢  我杯里还满着
No thanks. My cup is still full.

579
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,800
才没有
No, it isn't.

580
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,910
可我都还没喝呢
But I didn't drink it all.

581
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,090
让你加你就加
Just take the tea.

582
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,040
总之  在被雷击过后
Anyway, after the lightening strike,

583
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,890
我头发卷了整整两年呢
I had the perm for, like, two years.

584
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,750
怎么样
How's that?

585
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,660
雷纳
Rainer!

586
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,330
菲尔
Phil.

587
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,270
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

588
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,880
你不会是那种疯子追风者吧
You're not one of those storm chasers, are you?

589
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,340
电影《龙卷风》揭露了这行竞争激烈后就不是了
Not since the movie "Twister" exposed how cutthroat it is.

590
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,810
我是来向你道歉的
I came here to apologize.

591
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,040
你不用这样
Oh, you don't have to do that.

592
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,990
不  我得道歉
Yes, I do.

593
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,820
我自己误会你  还说了一堆
I was confused, and I said a bunch of stuff

594
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,090
冤枉你的坏话
that you didn't deserve.

595
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,780
的确如风暴过境伤到了我中部区域
It did hit me, right around the mid-section.

596
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,200
海莉已经够大  能自己做决定了
Listen, Haley's old enough to make her own decisions.

597
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,930
我很喜欢她  但如果跟她在一起你会不高兴...
I really like her, but if dating her is gonna be a problem...

598
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,480
我的确不喜欢这25岁的年龄差距
I don't love the 25-year age difference.

599
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,210
其实只有二十...
It's actually 20...

600
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,780
二岁
2 --

601
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,730
二十二岁差距
22.

602
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,820
但我真的很不想
Le-- I would just hate to think

603
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,020
因为我跟她在一起
that dating her meant that you and I

604
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,280
就不能跟你当朋友
still couldn't be, you know friends.

605
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,840
你还想跟我当朋友吗
You still want to be friends?

606
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,670
对啊
I do!

607
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,950
菲尔  我认识好多好多人
Phil, I know a million people,

608
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,500
但真心朋友却没几个
but I really don't have a lot of real friends.

609
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,580
体育新闻那个人也不是吗
Not even the sports guy?

610
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,530
每次广告结束后切回来现场
