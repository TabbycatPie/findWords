1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:02,492
孩子们，你们的巴尼叔叔很多年来
<i>Kids, for years, your Uncle Barney</i>

2
00:00:02,493 --> 00:00:05,035
一直嘲笑罗宾阿姨的加拿大人身份
had reveled in mocking
Aunt Robin's Canadian heritage.

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:07,687
旁边就是美国
To have to grow up
in Canada...

4
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:09,704
你非得在加拿大长大
with America right there.

5
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:12,124
你们全国就没一个像样的裁缝
It's like an entire country
without a tailor.

6
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:15,894
为什么 为什么我们居然让你们成为一个国家？
Why? Why do we let you be a country?!

7
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:17,715
但这一切就要改变了
 <i>But all that was about</i>
<i>to change.</i>

8
00:00:18,717 --> 00:00:22,217
伙计们，我有重要事情宣布 我上了Facebook
Guys, I have a very important annoucement to make.I was on Facebook.

9
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,603
Facebook上没什么潮人了
Nobody cool's on Facebook anymore.

10
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:26,522
那么，你知道Facebook上还有谁吗 
Well, you know who is on Facebook now?

11
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:28,073
你们每个人的爸妈
Everybody's parents.

12
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:30,559
我刚跟巴尼失散多年的老爸 
And I just happen to be friends

13
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:32,727
杰若姆・惠特克先生
with Barney's long-lost father,

14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,229
加了好友  -我也是
Mr. Jerome Whitaker. - Me, too.

15
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:35,864
他玩钻石迷情玩得真好
He's gotten really good at Bejeweled Blitz.

16
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:39,918
你们再猜猜是谁觉得我刚更新的关于曼尼托巴省状态
And guess who thought my status update about Manitoba was

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,123
很有意思 因为那个人的母亲正好生于曼尼托巴省？（在加拿大）
so interesting because his mother was born in Manitoba?

18
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,458
啥？
What?

19
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,743
意思就是你的奶奶...
Which means your grandmother...

20
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:49,645
不
No...

21
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:50,762
意思就是你...
Which makes you...

22
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:51,964
别说啦
Don't say it!

23
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,015
是四分之一的加拿大人
...one-quarter Canadian!

24
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:57,636
欢迎加入我们的族群 呆瓜
Welcome to the tribe, hoser!

25
00:00:57,638 --> 00:00:59,721
不...
No...

26
00:00:59,723 --> 00:01:01,857
不可能是真的
it's not true!

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,775
绝对不可能
That's impossible!

28

30
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:24,330
很久之前在万圣节派对上
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>at a Halloween party,</i>

31
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:26,731
我遇见了一个穿着南瓜服装的女孩
<i>I met a girl dressed like a pumpkin...</i>

32
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:27,732
一位浪荡的南瓜妹
<i>a slutty pumpkin.</i>

33
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:29,951
她牛逼呆了
<i>And she was extraordinary.</i>

34
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:32,671
可她在奇巧（一种零食）的包装纸上给了我她的电话
<i>But she gave me her number on a Kit Kat bar,</i>

35
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:35,006
悲剧的是我把那张写着电话的糖果当普通糖果送人了
<i>which was tragically given away as Halloween candy.</i>

36
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:36,958
我每年都去那个派对
<i>So every year I return to that same party</i>

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,510
希望能再一次见到她
<i>hoping I'd see her again.</i>

38
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:42,697
可每个十月匆匆而过 那份希冀变得越来越淡
<i>But with every passing October,that hope grew a little dimmer.</i>

39
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:45,667
追寻了十年后 有一天
<i>Then one day, after ten years of searching...</i>

40
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:47,752

我的天
Oh, my God.

41
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:50,021
浪荡南瓜妹
The slutty pumpkin.

42
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:52,924
这听起来可能有点诡异
This might sound creepy, but do you have a record

43
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:54,593
你有保存2001年租这套服装的记录吗
of who rented it in 2001?

44
00:01:57,613 --> 00:01:58,930
喔 这小菜一碟
Wow, that was easy.

45
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:00,815
你不是踏入我这道门的
You're not the first lovelorn young man

46
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:01,933
第一个相思男
to walk through that door.

47
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:04,236
有三个女孩穿着我老婆的浪荡洋葱装
Three girls got proposals off

48
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:07,155
被人追到求婚
my wife's slutty artichoke costume.

49
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:10,492
还有两个失踪了 但我喜欢持乐观态度
Two others disappeared,but I focus on the positive.

50
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:13,211
我简直不敢相信 我拿到了她的地址
<i>I couldn't believe it. I actually had her address.</i>

51
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:15,430
我知道我不能错过这次机会
<i>I knew I had to play this right.</i>

52
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:19,134
我可不能找过去直接敲她门
<i>It's not like I could just walk up and knock on her door.</i>

53
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:26,124
嗨 你可能不记得我了 但
Hi, you probably don't remember me, but...

54
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:28,626
十年前的万圣节
Halloween, ten years ago.

55
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:31,897
这可真是个一个漫长的剧集啊
Now that's a slow play.

56
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:35,800
第二天 莉莉和马修去
<i>The next day,Lily and Marshall headed out</i>

57
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,319
莉莉的爷爷奶奶家吃晚饭
<i>to Lily's grandparents for dinner.</i>

58
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,304
马修特别喜欢郊区
<i>Marshall loved it out in the 'burbs.</i>

59
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:40,972
看看我捉到多少萤火虫
Look how many fireflies I caught!

60
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:44,142
这次别忘了在罐子上面戳几个洞哟
Don't forget to poke holes in the jar this time.

61
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:47,979
我们给你准备了一个超棒的惊喜
Now we have a nice surprise for you.

62
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,366
不管是什么 说不
Whatever it is, we're saying no.

63
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:53,501
-什么？ 
-你知道的
- What?
- You know what.

64
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:54,753
我们每次来这儿
Every time we're here,

65
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:57,038
我祖父母总塞给咱们
my grandparents stick us with some big old piece of junk

66
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,489
一堆他们不想要的大破烂
they're getting rid of.

67
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,343
这简直是最糟糕的竞猜商品展示（参见巴尼参加the Price is Right那一集）
It's like the world's worst Showcase Showdown.

68
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:05,046
超完美的能用的割草机
It's a perfectly usable lawnmower!

69
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,016
我们住在公寓里
We live in an apartment!

70
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:09,267
可能未来的一天
But maybe someday

71
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,719
我们会搬到郊区
when we move to the suburbs...

72
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:12,554
我们绝不搬到郊区去住
We're never moving to the suburbs!

73
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:13,638
而且你还能得到
And you also get...

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,141
这支鹅颈麦克风
this skinny microphone!

75
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:17,892
喔
Oh!

76
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:21,346
在我们搬去佛罗里达之前
Before we head out to our place in Florida,

77
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:23,865
我们想给我们的宝贝孙女
we wanted to give our favorite granddaughter

78
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,533
一个小东西
a little something.

79
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:29,871
噢 真小 我喜欢
Ooh, it's so small.I love it!

80
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:32,374
-一把钥匙？ -房子归你们啦
- A key? - We're giving you the house.

81
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:36,161
莉莉 我知道你一直都不喜欢郊区
Lily, I know you've always hated the suburbs...

82
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:38,797
我们要啦
We'll take it!

83
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,583
我第一次跟浪荡南瓜妹约会的时候
NARRATOR: <i>For my first date with the slutty pumpkin,</i>

84
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:43,218
我带她去了一个特别的地方
<i>I took her someplace special.</i>

85
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,869
泰德 这真浪漫呀
Ted, this is so romantic.

86
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,805
这是我们十年前
The spot where we first met

87
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:48,506
第一次相遇的地方
ten years ago.

88
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,592
你还记得那天晚上放的那首歌吗
Do you remember the song that was playing that night?

89
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:53,345
我只记得你当时是多么美丽动人
I remember how beautiful you looked.

90
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:56,047
?你都一周没有看我了?
? It's been one week since you looked at me ?

91
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,984
?你把头转向一边说“我很生气”?
? Cocked your head to the side
and said, "I'm angry." ?

92
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:00,935
那是半裸女人乐队唱的吗
Is that, uh,the Barenaked Ladies, huh?

93
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:02,604
?你嘲笑了我五天?
? Five days since you laughedat me ?

94
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:04,823
?说“振作起来，回来见我”?
? Saying, "Get that together.Come back and see me." ?

95
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:09,077
孩子们 我花了十年的时间才吻到她的双唇
<i>Kids, it took me ten years,but I finally kissed her.</i>

96
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,563
感觉 糟糕透了
<i>And it was... terrible.</i>

97
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:21,271
莉莉 你讨厌郊区
Lily, you hate the suburbs.

98
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,854
我知道 可我的爷爷奶奶要给我这座房子
I know, but my grandparents giving us a house

99
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:25,389
正好是在孩子快要降生的时候
right when the baby's on the way?

100
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,506
这个时机太完美了
It's perfect timing.

101
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,525
确实很棒 我终于可以
This is great.I'm finally gonna be able

102
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,844
在空气流通的地方烤东西了
to barbecue with proper ventilation.

103
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,731
马修
Marshall! (coughing)

104
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:36,233
我们要搬到郊区去了 宝贝
We're moving to the suburbs, baby!

105
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,235
噢
Oh...

106
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,738
好吧
Okay.

107
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,623
宝贝 你们不能搬到郊区去
Baby, you're not moving to the suburbs.

108
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,574
为啥
Why not?

109
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:44,958
莉莉之所以同意
Lily is only agreeing

110
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,710
是因为孕妇大脑
to all this because of Pregnancy Brain.

111
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:48,796
孕妇大脑 哪有这种事
Pregnancy Brain? That's not a thing.

112
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:50,030
绝对有
It's totally a thing.

113
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:54,668
她的大脑里面灌满了由荷尔蒙
Her brain is marinating in a cocktail of hormones,

114
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,254
喜怒无常和筑巢天性组成的鸡尾酒
mood swings and jacked-up nesting instincts.

115
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,557
我的意思是 现在莉莉是个
I mean, yes, right now Lily is a goddess

116
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,309
孕育生命奇迹的女神
bestowing the miracle of life,

117
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:04,845
但是 她也是个笨蛋
but damn, she dumb!

118
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:08,182
好吧 我也注意到一些事情了
Well, I have noticed some stuff.

119
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:11,018
我找不到我的钥匙和钱包了
I can't find my keys or wallet anywhere!

120
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,053
我找到了
I found them...

121
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:15,555
在冰箱里
here in the freezer.

122
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:17,524
但是冰块格去哪了
Hey, but where are the ice cube trays?

123
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,643
不知道
No idea.

124
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,065
可怜的小冰块啊
Those poor ice cubes!

125
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:28,085
我觉得她最近有点不在状态
I guess she has been a little off lately.

126
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,920
只是有点吗 她刚刚给我发短信
A little? She just texted me

127
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:32,773
问要从洗手间回来的方向
wanting directions back from the bathroom.

128
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:36,293
噢  我们在这呢
Oh. We're over here!

129
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,179
你做的很好了 亲
You're doing great, sweetie!

130
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:42,249
那个小呆瓜现在不应该做任何重要的决定
That moron should not be making big life decisions right now.

131
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:43,884
要是你让她搬到了郊区
If you let her move to the suburbs,

132
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,936
那就像在占一个喝醉了的妞的便宜
it would be like taking advantage of a helpless drunk chick.

133
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,690
什么 在哪
What? Where?!

134
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:52,359
我已经有女朋友了 
Oh, I got a girlfriend, right.

135
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,447
亲 我们得推迟搬家这事了
Baby, we should put off moving.

136
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:57,448
为什么
Why?

137
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,199
因为我觉得怀孕这事正在
Because I think the pregnancy is

138
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:00,284
影响你的判断力
affecting your judgment.

139
00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:04,772
不是的 马修 这是多么难得的
No, Marshall, this is an amazing opportunity

140
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:07,107
大便宜啊
that we have to take advantage of!

141
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:09,710
我的身体里长了个菌子
Just because my body is growing a fungus...

142
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:11,211
孩子
Fetus.

143
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:12,479
并不意味着我的精神工厂
...doesn't mean that my metal factories...

144
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:14,214
精神功能
Metal faculties.

145
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:16,300
有任何的绳子
...are in any way funicular.

146
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,470
不知道她在说啥了
No idea.

147
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,459
挺好喝的 这是啥
This is nice.What is this?

148
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:26,626
加拿大威士忌
Canadian whiskey.

149
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,131
我要的是苏格兰威士忌
I want scotch!

150
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:35,519
来自苏格兰的美国威士忌
American scotch from Scotland!

151
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,971
把这个猪食拿远点
Get that swill away from me!

152
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,243
你为什么要这样对我
Why are you doing this to me?

153
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:45,112
从贾斯丁比伯才有除雪机的一半高的时候
You have been ripping on Canada

154
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,647
你就一直在挖苦加拿大
since Justin Bieber was knee-high to a snow blower.

155
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,650
所以现在 我这个加拿大人要像
So now this Canuck's gonna beat on you

156
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:53,504
尤康布兰登乐队的鼓手狂踩提姆毕滋牌甜甜圈一样狠狠打击你 （前者为加拿大乐队 后者为加拿大甜甜圈连锁店）
like the drummer from Yukon Blonde hopped up on Timbits.

157
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,756
-嘿 -嘿
- Hey.- Hey!

158
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,509
你和浪浪南瓜妹的约会怎么样
How was your big date with the Snuffy Tuffkin?

159
00:06:58,511 --> 00:06:59,826
荡荡南瓜妹
The Sniffy Napkin?

160
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:03,380
闷闷包皮妹
The Slouchy Foreskin?

161
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,664
莉莉困困鸟
Lily tie-tie.

162
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,268
很 一般
It was good... ish.

163
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,838
看 那是猎户座
Look, there's Orion's Belt.

164
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,106
噢
Oh.

165
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:15,225
为什么握个手感觉这么怪
<i>Why does holding hands feel this weird?</i>

166
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,394
我俩的手指不该绕在一起吗
<i>Should our fingers not intertwine?</i>

167
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:20,647
怎么会这么疼
<i>What's causing that pinching feeling?</i>

168
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,849
我还是握住她的手吧
<i>I'll just cup her hand.</i>

169
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:25,185
对 这样还
<i>There. That's...</i>

170
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:27,204
不是很好
<i>not great.</i>

171
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,027
她的头发堵住我鼻子了
<i>Her hair's up my nose.</i>

172
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:37,548
她的肩膀压到我的气管了
<i>Her shoulder's jabbing into my windpipe.</i>

173
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,299
也许我们应该换下位置
<i>Maybe if we reposition.</i>

174
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:45,872
我得说点什么
I have to say something.

175
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,391
她一定也觉得这样不舒服
She must be feeling it, too.

176
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:49,209
这种感觉太好了
This feels so right.

177
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:52,012
我们像两块拼图一样契合
We fit like two puzzle pieces.

178
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,230
对呀
Yeah.

179
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:56,600
泰德 我知道你等这个女孩等了十年
Ted, I know you've waited ten years for this girl,

180
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,718
但是有些人就是不适合
but some things just aren't meant to be.

181
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,854
别急着下定论哟 今晚结束的时候
Not so fast. At the end of the night,

182
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,657
当我靠着她 不小心亲到她的眼睛的时候
when I leaned in and somehow accidentally kissed

183
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,660
有一种微妙的感觉
her open eyeball, there was a slight flicker of something

184
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:09,746
我可以把它叫做
I might even call chemistry...

185
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:11,248
类似化学效应
adjacent.

186
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,400
谢谢
Thank you.

187
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:14,918
等等
Wait.

188
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,005
我的现金去哪里了
Where is my cash?

189
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,590
哦也
Oh, yeah,

190
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:22,292
我给你换了点小零钱 科纳克头儿 （一支加拿大冰球队）
I did a little exchange for ya, Canucklehead.

191
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:25,712
这个一元硬币在加拿大 叫做“鲁尼”
This Canadian dollar here is called a "loonie."

192
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:30,100
两元硬币呢 叫做“图尼” 真的哟
And this two-dollar coin? A "toonie." True story.

193
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:33,270
这是联邦货币 你们这些人居然把它叫得像
It's federal currency and you people talk about it

194
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:35,305
猫和老鼠里面的角色名称一样（Hannah- Barbera编导了猫和老鼠）
like it's a Hannah- Barbera character.

195
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,225
不是你们 巴尼
Not you people, Barney.

196
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,726
是我们
Our people.

197
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,195
虽然我和娜奥米的第一次约会
NARRATOR: <i>Even though my first date</i> <i>with Naomi was</i>

198
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:43,363
有一点点怪异
<i>a little awkward,</i>

199
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:45,432
但我们的第二次约会 更怪异了
<i>our second date was a lot awkward.</i>

200
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:46,867
嗯
Mmm...!

201
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:49,903
这真是我有史以来最糟糕的吻了
<i>This is the worst</i> <i>kissing of all time!</i>

202
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:50,937
嗯
Mmm...

203
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:52,739
她怎么还能这样投入
<i>How could she possibly</i> <i>be into this?</i>

204
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:55,075
她的声音听起来就像是
<i>She sounds like</i> <i>those cows in</i>

205
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,443
电影《自闭历程》中在那些压缩机里备受煎熬的牛一样
<i>Temple Grandin's hug machines.</i>

206
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:58,712
想听点音乐么
Do you want to listen to some music?

207
00:08:58,714 --> 00:08:59,563
嗯
Uh-huh!

208
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,754
泰德 这就是我们的歌
Ted, this is our song.

209
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,890
让我们在这歌声中爱爱吧
Let's make love to this song.

210
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:13,677
国界像公鸡的中国 中国小妞
? Chickety China,the Chinese chicken ?

211
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,295
拿起鼓槌 让我们嗨翻天
? Have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin' ?

212
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:16,763
额 我要先去下洗手间
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.

213
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,765
关上灯光 看着电视 因为我们在家
? <i>X-Files</i> with no lights on,we're <i>dans la maison.</i> ?

214
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,437
嘿 白痴
Hey, doofus!

215
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,439
是我 15岁的你
It's me:you at age 15.

216
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:26,657
我们许下过诺言
And we made a deal

217
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:29,993
我们会和任何自愿的女人滚床单的
we would always boink any chick that wants to boink us!

218
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:31,244
是的 她很漂亮
Yes, she's beautiful,

219
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:33,580
只是我们没有任何感觉
it's just there's no connection there.

220
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:35,148
我对她没有任何欲望
I don't feel intimate with her.

221
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,950
欲望  让我来帮你回想一些
"Intimate"? Let me remind you of some things

222
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,286
你在15岁的时候感到过有欲望的东西
you did feel "intimate" with when you were 15:

223
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,420
棒球手套
a catcher's mitt,

224
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:42,989
烤炉手套 一杯热水
an oven mitt,a glass of warm water,

225
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:46,627
一个打开一半的沙发床 一台置顶录像机
a half-open hide-a-bed sofa,a top-loading VCR!

226
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,878
这不会再发生了
It's not gonna happen!

227
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,514
别这样啊
Come on!

228
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:53,684
就花30秒就好了啊
It'll take, like, 30 seconds!

229
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,520
娜奥米 听我说
Naomi, listen...

230
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:59,523
嘘
Shh...

231
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,694
你喜欢这样么 泰德
You like that, Ted?

232
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:04,861
嗯
Hmm.

233
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:08,398
你喜欢我摩挲你的秀发么
Do you like it when I caress your hair?

234
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,851
你的头发摩挲起来真舒服
Your hair is so nice to caress.

235
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:13,954
为什么她一定要说这个词
<i>Why is she saying that word?</i>

236
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:16,406
我喜欢摩挲你的头发
I like to caress your hair.

237
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:20,243
又来了 摩挲 为什么要说这个
<i>There it is again! "Caress!"</i> <i>Who says that?</i>

238
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,246
摩 挲
Caress.

239
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,866
事实是 我喜欢她 懂么
The thing is,I like her, okay?

240
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:28,969
我真的真的很喜欢她
I really, really like her.

241
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:32,139
我只是不喜欢她说的或做的一切
I just don't seem to like anything she says or does.

242
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:34,891
我得去和她分手不是么
I have to break up with her, don't I?

243
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:35,942
是的
All: Yes!

244
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:37,978
在你睡了她之后再分手
After you sleep with her, yes!

245
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:40,714
马修 我一直在想你说的话
Marshall, I've been thinking about what you said.

246
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:43,567
你是对的 我们不该搬去郊区
You're right, we shouldn't move to the suburbs.

247
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,603
我们现在不该做出任何重要的人生决定
Let's not make any huge life decisions right now.

248
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,522
是因为你今早想用笔记本电脑
Is this because you tried to make waffles

249
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:49,723
来做华夫饼么
with the laptop this morning?

250
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:53,160
不管怎么说 我马上准备去找个房屋中介
Anyway, I'm gonna call a real estate broker

251
00:10:53,162 --> 00:10:54,945
明早来看看那房子
to come look at the house tomorrow.

252
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,546
哦 顺便说一句
Oh, by the way,

253
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:58,699
我预定了一些明尼苏达维京窗帘
I ordered those Minnesota Vikings drapes.

254
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,918
你是对的 他们绝对能装点我们的公寓
You're right, they're totally gonna class up our apartment.

255
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:07,641
你是对的 去搞一个醉酒的妹子是不道德的
Okay, yes. It's wrong to bang a drunk chick.

256
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:10,744
但如果你对她什么都不做的话 你就是个白痴
But you're an idiot if you don't get, like, a little something.

257
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:14,264
哟 加拿大人
Yo, Canada.

258
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:16,383
什么 擦嘞
What? Dammit!

259
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,251
哈哈 现在叫你加拿大人你都会有反应了
Ha, you answer to "Canada" now.

260
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:21,354
我跟你打个赌
I'll make you a deal.

261
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:22,723
如果你穿了这身打扮
You wear this costume

262
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,641
去了明晚的万圣节派对
to the Halloween party tomorrow night,

263
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,810
我从此以后都不耍你了
I'll drop it forever.

264
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:31,732
你开玩笑呢吧
You can't be serious.

265
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:34,651
哦 我很严肃 就像是在一场
在加拿大希库蒂米举办
Oh, I am as serious as a poutine shortage

266
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,237
的加拿大式冰球比赛中少了
加拿大式的肉汁乳酪薯条一样严肃
in Chicoutimi during a curling bonspiel.

267
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:40,940
你说的我一个字都听不懂
I don't know what any of those words mean.

268
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,126
不 你懂的
Yes. You do.

269
00:11:47,783 --> 00:11:50,133
哦 一定是房屋中介 马修 你能去开个门么
Oh, that must be the broker. Marshall, will you get it?

270
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:52,302
当然 没问题
Sure. Of course.

271
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:55,222
不给糖就捣蛋
Trick or treat!

272
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:57,624
哦 我勒个去 好可爱的小盆友
Oh, my gosh. How cute!

273
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:59,392
对不起 我们没有糖果
I'm sorry, we don't have any candy.

274
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:01,178
额 我们忘了有不给糖就捣蛋这茬儿了
Um, we forgot about trick-or-treaters.

275
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,395
在我们住的地方不需要给糖果
We don't get any where we live.

276
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:05,315
是哎 只有在这种郊区
Yup. Only get this kind of cuteness

277
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:06,650
才会遇到你们这些小可爱
in the suburbs.

278
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:13,490
哦 看这些小孩子 多可爱多快乐而且无公害
Oh. Look at how sweet and happy and unarmed they all are!

279
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:16,660
你是想通过用这些可爱的小盆友
Are you using adorable little children in costumes

280
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:17,828
来操纵我么   -拜拜
to manipulate me?   - Bye!

281
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,979
我想说 你到底有没有打电话给中介
I mean, did you even call a real estate broker?

282
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:21,865
没
No.

283
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,950
我现在有个狡诈的孕期大脑
I've got Pregnancy Brain like a fiddle

284
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,420
而且我像一只狐狸一样在耍你
and I've been playing you like a fox.

285
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:35,145
哦 加拿大
? Oh, Canada... ?

286
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:40,550
我们的家乡和领土
? Our home and native land... ?

287
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:45,522
我知道和娜奥米分手会很难
NARRATOR: <i>I knew it would be tough</i> <i>to break up with Naomi.</i>

288
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:48,225
但没有感觉的时候 你不能强求
<i>But when it's just not there,</i> <i>you can't force it.</i>

289
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:53,480
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween.

290
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,983

就这样 我想起了十年前
<i>And just like that, I was taken back ten years...</i>

291
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,153
那个挂着选举牌的满怀希望的孩子
<i>to the hopeful kid in the hanging chad costume,</i>

292
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,022
完全拜倒在了淫荡南瓜妹的石榴裙下
<i>falling head over heels for the Slutty Pumpkin.</i>

293
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:05,909
我给你做了点东西
I made you something.

294
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:11,381
-噢  -我们初次见面的时候你的服装
- Oh.  - Your costume from that first night.

295
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:14,084
虽然你知道即便是在十年前 
Although you do realize that even ten years ago,

296
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,920
挂着这个选举牌也让你像个一岁大的小屁孩
the hanging chad reference was like almost a year old.

297
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,372
哇哦
(laughs) Wow...

298
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:21,258
难以置信你这么做了
I can't believe you made this.

299
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,543
难以置信你找到我了
I can't believe you found me.

300
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:26,847
hold住 泰迪熊 你可以的
TED: <i>Stay strong, Teddy. We can do this.</i>

301
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,648
我
I...

302
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,101
要和你分手 说就是了
<i>"Have to break up with you," just say it.</i>

303
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,353
爱 等等 神马
Love... <i>Wait, what?</i>

304
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,721
不不不

305
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:36,823
说落日 薄煎饼 神马都行
<i>Say sunsets! Pancakes! Anything!</i>

306
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:38,057
就是不要说
<i>Just don't say...</i>

307
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,359
你
You.

308
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:42,445
不
<i>No!</i>

309
00:13:46,444 --> 00:13:47,994
巴尼 你在哪呢
Barney? Where are you?

310
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,906
你比迪芬贝克在节礼日
You're moving slower than John Diefenbaker

311
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:52,575
爬汉戈比山还要慢
climbing Mount Hungabee on Boxing Day.

312
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:54,877
这些在我们共同的祖国确实经常被提到
Those are all real references to our shared homeland.

313

我马上来
BARNEY: I'll be right there.

314

（Dudley Do-Right是美国动画片里的加拿大骑警）
Can't wait to see you in your costume, Dudley Do-Right.

00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:02,468
生活在美国

322
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:20,586
生活在美国

323
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:24,490

如果我们搬来这里 你生了孩子
If we move here, you're just going to have that baby,

327
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,200
然后你就会开始恨我
and then you're going to hate me

328
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:36,536
因为我让你这么做了 我会喜欢这的
for letting you do this. I'm going to love it here.

329
00:14:36,538 --> 00:14:40,123
噢 在郊区我们会有很多的空间
Oh, we'd have so much room in the suburbs.

330
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:44,326
你可以得到你一直想要的弹球机
You can get that pinball machine you've always wanted.

331
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:47,380
你把它放在哪儿都行
You can put it anywhere you want.

332
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:50,099
行了 你根本不知道你在说什么
Stop it. You don't know what you're saying.

333
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:51,551
放哪儿都行
Anywhere.

334
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:55,054
楼上 楼下
Upstairs, downstairs...

335
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:57,356
你可以把它固定在后面
you can stick it in the back.

336
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,894
莉莉 我特别想住在这个房子里
Lily, I want to be inside this house so bad.

337
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:04,831
美利坚 美利坚

340
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:09,869
好吧 那么比起穿上加拿大骑警的服装
Okay, so rather than wearing a Mountie costume

341
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:11,320
让我永远不提这事
and end this forever,

342
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:13,189
你宁愿光膀子参加一个露天派对
you show up shirtless to an outdoor party?

343
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:14,540
这可是十一月
It's practically November.

344
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,959
没什么大不了的 我不冷
No biggie. I ain't cold.

345
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:18,961
额 有意思
Huh. Interesting.

346
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:20,463
挺好玩的
It's fascinating.

347
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:23,499
就好像经过无数代的进化之后
Almost as if your body was accustomed to low temperatures

348
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:26,385
你的身体还是适应于低温
after generations of adapting.

349
00:15:26,387 --> 00:15:27,970
加拿大
(whispering): Canada.

350

很高兴认识你们
Nice to meet you guys.

354
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,265
我要去做一些甜心酒   我发明的
I'm gonna go make some Tootsie Rolls. It's a drink I invented.

355
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:40,233
我还给它配了歌舞
There's a song and dance

356
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:41,768
但在表演之前
that goes along with it, but I have to

357
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,102
我必须喝上三杯
drink three of them before I can do it.

358
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:46,873
噢 好 你去吧
Oh. Okay. You go.

359
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,691
这边
This way.

360
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,229
理论上听起来不错
Sounds delicious. In theory.

361
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:55,564
但是你不尝尝是不会知道的
But you never know until you taste it.

362
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:59,902
泰德 你尝了她的甜心酒吗
Ted... have you tasted her Tootsie Roll?

363
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:00,920
当然没有
Of course not.

364
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:03,172
-噢  -等会 你尝了没
- Ow.  - Wait. Have you?

365
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:07,760
你跟一个毫无感觉的人上床了
You had sex with someone you have zero feelings for!

366
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:09,078
美利坚
U-S-A!

367
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,129
美利
U-S...

368
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:12,265
够了
Stop it.

369
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,100
哪儿都感觉不对
Just no part of it felt right.

370
00:16:14,102 --> 00:16:16,385
一开始眼神交流太多了 后来又不够了
At first there was too much eye contact, then not enough.

371
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:18,420
你俩做爱的时候你在看哪
Where do you look during sex?

372
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:21,057
额 在看一个藏起来的摄像机以后我可以看录像
Um, into the hidden camera at future me watching it.

373
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,310
好吧 等等 
Okay. Wait. How does

374
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:26,562
“我想和你分手”这句话  是如何导致你俩上床的
saying "I want to break up with you" lead into sex?

375
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:29,866
其实我没有说 我想和你分手
I didn't say "I want to break up with you," exactly.

376
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:31,484
实际上你说什么了
What did you say, exactly?

377
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,737
我爱你
"I love you."

378
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:37,273
经典莫湿比
Classic Schmosby.

379
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:42,829
马修 这房子想你想疯了
Marshall, this house wants you so bad.

380
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:45,248
修剪我的草坪
"Mow my lawn.

381
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,883
打扫我的落叶
"Rake my leaves.

382
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,751
过冬之前检查我的管道
Winterize my pipes""

383
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:49,919
好
Yes!

384
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,587
好 我
Yes! I'm coming...

385
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:53,289
同意这个决定
to terms with this decision!

386
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,224
噢
(doorbell rings)Oh!

387
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:57,093
不给糖就捣蛋
Trick or treat!

388
00:16:57,095 --> 00:16:57,810
耶
Yay!

389
00:16:57,812 --> 00:17:00,012
好吧
Okay.

390
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:03,099
噢
Oh.

万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween.

392
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:09,355
-莉莉 -肿么了
- Lily. - Yeah?

393
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:10,823
你刚刚给了那些孩子
You just gave those children

394
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:13,976
一个订书机 一把锋利的剪刀
a stapler,a pair of sharp scissors,

395
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:16,279
以及一瓶超好的黑比诺葡萄酒
and a pretty decent Pinot Noir.

396
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:17,663
不是吧
I did?

397
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:20,533
噢 额滴神
Oh, my God.

398
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:24,370
我会非常想念那个订书机的
 I'm going to miss that stapler so much.

399
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,926
我是不是不在状态
I'm not doing so great, am I?

400
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:31,961
有点
Maybe not.

401
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:36,799
我们是不是不应该在现在
We shouldn't make any huge life decisions

402
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:38,434
做任何重要的人生决定 对吧
right now, should we?

403
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:43,272
嘿 听着 我爱你 我也很想在有草坪和白色栅栏的地方
Hey, look, I love you and I-I love the idea of raising

404
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,358
抚养我们的孩子
our kids with a lawn and a white picket fence,

405
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,509
但是我们有一生的时间来决定
but we have our whole lives to decide when

406
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:49,812
什么时候以及我们是否要这样做
and if we want to do that.

407
00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:52,014
做啥
Do what?

408
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:54,567
我们回家吧
Let's get you home.

409
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:01,624
噢
Ooh.

410
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:04,193
这是你给我们订书机的代价
That's for the stapler!

411
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:06,362
我讨厌郊区
I hate the suburbs.

412
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:10,917
娜奥米
Naomi...

413
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,534
我们得分手了
We have to end this.

414
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:13,535
啥
W-- huh?

415
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:15,171
抱歉 甜心酒让我
I'm sorry, Tootsie Rolls make me

416
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:17,556
想说实话
really honest.

417
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:22,395
泰德 我知道你超级喜欢我
Ted... I know you're super into me.

418
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:24,847
但是我们非常的不适合
But we are terrible together.

419
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,515
等等 什么
Wait, what?

420
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:30,853
我一直在试着说些让人感觉好的事情 但是并没有
I've been trying, saying things felt good that didn't just to...

421
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:35,324
我以为说感觉对了就会使我们真的感觉对了 但是
I thought saying it was good would make it feel good, but...

422
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,829
感觉还是不对
...it always felt off.

423
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,334
为什么他总是在嗅我得头发
NAOMI: <i>Why won't he stop sniffing my hair?</i>

424
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:46,836
这个手怎么牵成这样了
<i>And what's up with the hand holding?</i>

425
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:50,506
就像他在比扳拇指大赛一样
<i>It's like he's trying to win a thumb war.</i>

426
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:53,742
泰德 这是我们的歌
Ted, this is our song.

427
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:56,429
噢 不 他该不会真以为我喜欢这首歌吧
<i>Oh, no, he thinks I'm actually into this song.</i>

428
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:58,547
他没能体会到反讽的意味吗
<i>Does he not get sarcasm?</i>

429
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:01,517
让我们来跟着这首歌爱爱吧
Let's make love to this song.

430
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,852
我要做得再过一点
<i>I'll just be even more ridiculous</i>

431
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:04,854
让他明白这是个玩笑
<i>to make it clear it's a joke.</i>

432
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,772
国界像公鸡的中国 中国小妞
? Chickety-China, the Chinese chicken... ?

433
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:08,024
我
I...

434
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:10,192
啊噢 你打算干啥呢 哥们
<i>Uh-oh, where you going with this, buddy?</i>

435
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:11,310
爱
...love...

436
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:12,594
不是吧 太快了点吧
<i>Nope, too soon.</i>

437
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:14,981
接着说 巴吉度猎犬 椒盐脆饼 只要不是
<i>Say basset hounds,Pretzel Crisps, anything but...</i>

438
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:16,281
你
...you.

439
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:18,148
额滴神 赶紧用亲亲来阻止他求婚吧
<i>Oh, God, just kiss him before he proposes.</i>

440
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:23,205
泰德 我在过去的九个万圣节里
Ted, I've been looking for the Hot Hanging Chad

441
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:25,825
一直在找那个性感的选举牌
for the last nine Halloweens.

442
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:27,660
我费力的穿过
I've waded through a sweaty parade

443
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:30,046
由巨大的勒巴斯基、哈利波特
of Big Lebowskis, Harry Potters,

444
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:32,048
安东尼 都德森和那个总是打扮得
Antoine Dodsons, and that jackass

445
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,883
像个洗衣袋的呆瓜组成的游行队伍
who always dresses as laundry.

446
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:35,251
我讨厌那个人
Oh, I hate that guy.

447
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:37,970
那就是为什么一旦我找到了你
That's why,once I finally found you...

448
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,141
和你分手这件事就变得很困难了
...it was hard to let you go.

449
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:44,977
再见了 泰德
Good-bye, Ted.

450
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:51,734
我们还是不要再有任何的肢体接触吧
Let's just not touch ever again.

451
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:52,685
可能是个好主意
Probably a good idea, yeah.

452
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:54,737
好的
Okay.

453

真抱歉 我的头太硬了点
