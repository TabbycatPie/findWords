00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,370
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

21
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,550
You work together and you are sleeping together.

22
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,060
You don't see any way that can go wrong?

23
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,430
You went out on a limb for me.

24
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,760
You fire me now, you look like a fool in front of the board.

25
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,450
Dr. Andrews, I don't think you have the votes to carry it.

26
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,720
But I don't need the votes.

27
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,560
Just as you have the power to fire someone

28
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,240
under your supervision, so do I.

29
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
Did you hear about Han?

30
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,330
Can't imagine Andrews will survive the fallout.

31
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,970
They're gonna need a new Chief of Surgery.

32
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,370
Aoki should be calling you with the offer any minute.

33
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,630
Here are flowers and chocolates.

34
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,950
Are you asking me out?

35
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:30,830
Yes.

36
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,120
I would love to.

37
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,230
Why are you smiling?

38
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,930
I don't know.

39
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,490
I just... I wanted you to know that...

40
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,530
things are okay.

Pardon me?

59
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,390
- It's okay. They can just take that off. - I said no pickles.

60
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,480
Oh. I am so sorry.

61
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,190
I said no pickles.

62
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,800
It was a disaster.

63
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,540
What happened?

00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,540

Sorry. We were just...

66
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,800
Shaun was on a date.

67
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,540
Congratulations on your promotion.

68
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,920
I believe you're our first female Chief of Surgery.

69
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,200
That's nice. Uh, thank you. Yes.

70
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,780
And you're still not working.

71
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,430
Not you.

72
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,300
We need to go to H.R. and break up.

73
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,020
We need a head CT and a trauma panel.

74
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,430
Please! Someone! Help my wife!

75
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,640
We've been married for 45 years.

76
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,660
Two children.

77
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,770
Eh, so far.

78
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,140
Oh, stop it.

79
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,450
Ricky and Tammy.

80
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,530
Ricky's got two kids of his own.

81
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,470
When did you first notice the pain?

82
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,530
- This morning. - No, on Saturday.

83
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,030
He has a history of kidney stones.

84
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,620
I try to get him to drink more water...

85
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,860
You "try"?

86
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,000
When did I ever say no to you?

87
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,490
It's probably another stone, but we'll do some imaging

88
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,230
to rule out anything more serious.

89
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,530
Thank you.

90
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,330
Did you tell them about the kids?

91
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,010
We have two, you know.

92
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,970
So far.

93
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,780
That's nice.

94
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,530
- Not it. - What?

95
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,510
He's got dementia, and even worse, it's boring.

96
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,350
Probably stones.

97
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,910
Best case scenario, it's a kidney tumor.

98
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,010
We've assisted on eight nephrectomies.

99
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,560
It's your case, your chart, you're primary.

100
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,420
Kellan's coming to town.

101
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,110
I need to be out of here at a decent hour,

102
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,230
and we are not children.

103
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,340
We do not decide things by who called it.

104
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,750
You touched the chart first. It's yours.

105
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,040
- Did not. - Did so.

106
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,430
We walked up together, Petringa handed the chart to you.

107
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,720
- Did not. - Did so.

108
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,010
- Did not. - Did so.

109
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,730
Why?

110
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,060
It just wasn't working out.

111
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,500
Well, I certainly hope it's not because in light of

112
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,770
Dr. Lim's recent promotion to Chief of Surgery

113
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,330
that she's now your supervisor?

114
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,980
We knew that arrangement

115
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,150
would be unacceptable,

116
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,300
and since we only recently started seeing each other...

117
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,210
You were seeing each other secretly for some time

118
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,160
before you reported it, correct?

119
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,310
So, maybe you've just gone back

120
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,060
to seeing each other in secret.

121
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,260
No. Uh, we made the decision that this opportunity

122
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,090
for Dr. Lim is just...

123
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,020
You're -- what -- what are you writing?

124
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,560
I have accepted your explanation and report.

125
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,490
Thank you.

126
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,920
But I don't believe it.

127
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,770
You're going to keep seeing each other,

128
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,390
and I can't do anything to stop that, nor do I even want to.

129
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,730
But know this -- love doesn't conquer all,

130
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,180
lust doesn't either, and like doesn't even come close.

131
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,210
This is gonna be a lot more complicated

132
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,540
than either of you think.

133
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,960
Looks like you have a large uterine fibroid

134
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,750
that's bled.

135
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,400
It has to be removed surgically.

136
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,470
Yes, routine surgery. You should be fine.

137
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,830
Uterine? Am I gonna be able to have --

138
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,480
The surgery won't affect your ability to have children.

139
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,070
I didn't let her finish her question

140
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,390
because I anticipated what she was going to ask

141
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,590
because the uterus has very few functions.

142
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,400
- Nicely done. - Yes.

143
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,680
To improve O.R. access, we're going to automatic block release

144
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,420
and implement staggered starts for anesthesia.

145
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
Any questions?

146
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,680
Dr. Andrews and Dr. Han wouldn't authorize staff overtime.

147
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,650
Now, our nurses --

148
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,210
Good point. Thank you.

149
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,940
Yes. Authorized.

150
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,790
One other thing, and this is really for our third years,

151
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,540
but it will affect all of you.

152
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,660
Traditionally, you don't get to lead surgeries

153
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,880
until fourth year.

154
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,040
That will be changing.

155
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,220
The earlier you get in there and take responsibility,

156
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,860
the more chance you have to learn.

157
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,910
When the right surgery comes along -- something simple,

158
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,450
basic, it'll be yours.

159
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,320
Start prepping.

160
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,590
Maybe I did touch the chart first.

161
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,190
Relax. It's okay.

162
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,840
I can stay late now and again. This is my job.

163
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,850
Stop it.

164
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,320
You don't want the case. It's boring. I get it.

165
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,860
I know you get it. Boring is now exciting.

166
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,770
Boring means it's a routine surgery,

167
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,050
which means it's a surgery

168
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,010
that Lim just said one of us may well lead.

169
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,730
This one's probably no surgery at all.

170
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,580
It's probably just kidney stones and late nights

171
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,040
with a man with dementia.

172
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,460
I'll take that chance.

173
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,650
You hate people.

174
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,900
People don't know that.

175
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,510
People like me.

176
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,630
You need to be with your family.

177
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,190
Kellan's 16. He barely talks to me.

178
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,430
It's who touched the chart first, which, as you said, was me.

179
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,210
- And as you said - Excuse me.

180
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,840
Y-yes, Harvey? Is everything okay?

181
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,600
Why am I in here?

182
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,320
Nothing to worry about. It's likely just a kidney stone.

183
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,120
You just have to --

184
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,160
Yes! It's cancer.

185
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,390
Nicely isolated, simple surgery.

186
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,170
Perfect for a resident.

187
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,350
Put some traction on the uterus to expose the broad ligament.

188
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,650
I'll slide the pelvic retractor under the fundus.

189
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,940
Did the wine spill all over you?

190
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,140
Did it spill all over Carly?

191
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,120
S-stop.

192
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,870
Look above the posterior cul De sac.

193
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,090
- Cancer. - Yes.

194
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,580
Very extensive, I think.

195
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,590
It appears to have metastasized everywhere.

196
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,810
Liver, kidney, abdominal wall.

197
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,400
Close her up.

198
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,070
I rang the doorbell.

199
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,920
Yes, you did.

200
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,550
Are you gonna spend the rest of your life

201
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,260
lying around in this backyard?

202
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,540
That, and lying next to my future wife.

203
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,360
Congratulations. I heard.

204
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,050
But what are you going to do professionally?

205
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,030
When people think they're going to die, like you did,

206
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,950
they assess their life,

207
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,170
reevaluate what's important.

208
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,130
You're going to need to make a difference.

209
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,620
Do you have a puppy for me to adopt?

210
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,590
I have a vacancy at President.

211
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,610
Again?

212
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,860
You're interested,

213
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,330
but you think things have to change.

214
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,360
They don't.

215
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,120
You led a meaningful life before cancer,

216
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,870
and you will lead a meaningful life after.

217
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,180
Well, thank you. I'm very inspired.

218
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,980
Think about it.

219
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,120
Also, sunscreen.

220
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,110
What's going on behind the pancreas

221
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,110
at the root of the superior mesenteric artery?

222
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,860
We need a better angle.

223
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,360
We're not gonna get a better angle.

224
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,670
Definitely not when we're actually operating.

225
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,010
So what's the solution?

226
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,810
There isn't one.

227
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,240
Not surgically.

228
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,550
We should refer them to an oncologist.

229
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,050
Chemo might help, but I'm not hopeful.

230
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,050
What are you gonna tell them?

231
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,040
You guys are third year.

232
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,020
You want stuff to learn by doing?

233
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,980
How about sympathetic communication?

234
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,310
Shaun, let the bride know she's probably dying.

235
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,070
This morning, who did you give the Calderon chart to?

236
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,450
I gave it to you guys.

237
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,680
Uh, but you handed it to one of us.

238
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,390
One of us actually took it from you.

239
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,770
It was me, right?

240
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,090
I don't know. What does it matter?

241
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,700
You just came up and --

242
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,850
From the right. I came up on Morgan's left.

243
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,910
You're left-handed?

244
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,610
It only makes sense that I would be closer to --

245
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,730
Excuse me.

246
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,140
Is there any news about my husband?

247
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,370
Harvey, you remember Drs. Park and Reznick.

248
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,510
They did your scan.

249
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,900
R-right. For my, uh...

250
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,470
They were looking for kidney stones.

251
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,270
Unfortunately, we found some cancer.

252
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,690
- It's on your left kidney. - Cancer?

253
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,450
The good news is it's isolated

254
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,320
and in a very operable location.

255
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:21,740
Cancer.

256
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,770
I have cancer?

257
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,660
We have to tell the children.

258
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,380
We'll do a biopsy to confirm,

259
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,810
but I'm confident that we caught it early.

260
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,960
This is terrible. I...I can't die.

261
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,280
I...You need me.

262
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,570
I know.

263
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,860
But with surgery, radiation, and immunotherapy,

264
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,590
the prognosis is excellent.

265
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,440
You're supposed to be talking to our patient.

266
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,960
They can wait until we're sure.

267
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,210
We are sure. Dr. Melendez is sure.

268
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,650
Dr. Lim told us

269
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,820
we're ready for more responsibility,

270
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,330
so I decided I can make a decision on my own,

271
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,370
and I decided to do some more research.

272
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,620
Shaun, you need to learn how to do this,

273
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,530
and stalling just makes it worse.

274
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,950
I think maybe you're feeling bad about your date,

275
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,170
and you're in here - burying yourself in things

276
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,340
you subconsciously think you can control.

277
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,310
How do people know what's going on in their subconscious?

278
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,040
What happened, Shaun...

279
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,520
when you jumped up?

280
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,690
{\an9}{\an9}♪ Fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love ♪

281
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,620
{\an9}{\an9}♪ In love with someone, ever fallen in love ♪

282
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,600
{\an9}{\an9}♪ In love with someone ♪

283
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,530
{\an9}{\an9}♪ You shouldn't have fallen in love with ♪

284
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,890
Your phone is ringing.

285
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,250
It can wait.

286
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,130
It's your mother.

287
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,100
It can wait.

288
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,210
What went wrong? What was the disaster?

289
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,860
She called earlier, too.

290
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,260
If stalling is bad,

291
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,990
then why are you avoiding your mother's calls?

292
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,040
Did you ever forgive your mother for not protecting you?

293
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,130
Is that what - your mother wants to know?

294
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,820
My mother was a terrible mother.

295
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,130
It wasn't all her fault. She was bipolar.

296
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,660
That doesn't change the fact that she was terrible.

297
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,190
I -- I don't think it's good for her to be in my life.

298
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,440
Are you looking for guidance...

299
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,590
from me?

300
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,370
Am I a role model to you?

301
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,160
On some issues, absolutely.

302
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,850
I don't usually think about the past.

303
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,040
It doesn't help.

304
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,020
But the date.

305
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,240
Yesterday is part of the past, and the past matters.

306
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,040
What happened?

307
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,690
I...told a joke.

308
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,240
- No. - Yes.

309
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,960
Lea said I should.

310
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,550
No. That is not what I said.

311
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,170
Does this tie look good?

312
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,980
Yes. But not with those pants.

313
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,970
And what I was saying was that jokes are the types of things

314
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,390
people do on dates.

315
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,550
They talk about the weather, hobbies,

316
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,510
where they went to college.

317
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,010
I'm a person.

318
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,290
Should I change my pants with you in the room?

319
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:52,990
I said no.

320
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,130
And, yes, I know you're a person, Shaun,

321
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,800
but we all have strengths and weaknesses.

322
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,950
Telling jokes is easy. There are books full of them.

323
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,470
I said no.

324
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,360
Yes, there are a lot of jokes,

325
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,400
but you have to know how to tell them.

326
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,110
You have to know when to tell them.

327
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,610
So, I took a gap year before college, which,

328
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,020
in hindsight, I think might have been a mistake.

329
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,910
Staying at home.

330
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,960
My relationship with my dad --

331
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,860
Caesar walked into a bar

332
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,300
and asked the bartender for a martinus.

333
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,400
The bartender said, "Do you mean a martini?"

334
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,160
And Caesar says, "If I wanted two,

335
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,670
I would have ordered two."

336
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,290
Did she laugh?

337
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,840
I'm not sure.

338
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,950
Well, what did she say?

339
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,480
She made a sound.

340
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,530
"Heh.

341
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,520
Heh heh heh."

342
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,630
You got a chuckle, I think.

343
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,170
-That's --that's good. - No, it's not.

344
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,270
I read six joke books, and all I got

345
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,080
was a... "Heh. Heh, heh, heh."

346
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,400
It was a disaster.

347
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,870
Because of a joke?

348
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,970
Something bigger must have gone wrong.

349
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,280
What happened?

350
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,040
A young woman may be dying.

351
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,100
I have a lot of research to do.

352
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,900
Boom. My chart, my case, my patient, my surgery.

353
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,860
You took it from me.

354
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,140
It touched my fingers -- I know it did --

355
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,960
and then you took it from me.

356
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,620
All I know is I'm the one holding the chart.

357
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,930
That's the evidence we got to deal with.

358
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,060
- If you could prove -- - Angles.

359
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,860
We need more angles.

360
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,860
How many cameras do we have in that section?

361
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,060
Dr. Lim, I'm glad you made that decision on the overtime.

362
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,920
You're welcome.

363
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,700
But I thought you'd want to know the real issue

364
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,790
isn't the overtime. It's being understaffed.

365
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,960
We need two more nurses on this floor alone, one in ICU --

366
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,710
I'm sorry. I'm sure you're right,

367
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,730
but we just don't have the budget.

368
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,300
Excuse me?

369
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,020
Nothing, ma'am.

370
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,530
I gave you the OT. You're not being fair.

371
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,320
Aren't I?

372
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,360
You told me I was right,

373
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,990
then you told me you're not gonna do it.

374
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,650
Who's being unfair?

375
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,250
Nobody said this job...

376
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,500
Shaun.

377
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,640
Come with me.

378
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,420
Is everything okay?

379
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,700
The nurse told us you didn't finish the surgery.

380
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,160
Suzanne...

381
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,240
you have very extensive cancer

382
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,790
throughout your abdomen.

383
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,580
It appears to be malignant.

384
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,240
And it appears to have metastasized around every organ.

385
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,810
But there's hope with surgery.

386
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,950
We can't see the retrohepatic part of the cancer

387
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,840
because of the liver.

388
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,370
We can't see the retroperitoneal part

389
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,000
- because of the right kidney. - Yes, I know.

390
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,090
That's why we should take out the organs.

391
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,530
You want to remove her liver and right kidney?

392
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,540
Yes.

393
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,280
And also her left kidney and her pancreas

394
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
and her intestinal tract and the stomach.

395
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,080
You do know that several of those organs

396
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,040
are quite essential.

397
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,270
We'll put them back.

398
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,180
We remove them, clean up the cancer,

399
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,470
then put them back.

400
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,500
Ex vivo surgery.

401
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,400
It's been done for pancreatic cancer.

402
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,730
Without much success.

403
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,670
No.

404
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,280
You think it'd work better here?

405
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,970
Not really.

406
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,180
But the alternative is death.

407
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:58,900
How are you?

408
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,760
Good.

409
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,920
N-not working?

410
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,400
Yeah.

411
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,380
It's been 72 hours, and I still haven't found a job.

412
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,730
Relax. I'll be fine.

413
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,090
I got some irons in the fire. What do you need?

414
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,540
How do you say no to a person?

415
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,110
I don't think I'm doing it right.

416
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,170
Okay. Watch closely.

417
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,510
Really?

418
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,730
If you're gonna give up that easily,

419
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,070
you might as well just quit now.

420
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,900
The biopsy confirmed that the kidney cancer is

421
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,360
a renal cell carcinoma.

422
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,440
Cancer? I have cancer?

423
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,780
Yes.

424
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,450
Why didn't you tell me?

425
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,990
We did.

426
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,890
The good news is that it's treatable with surgery

427
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,010
and immunotherapy and radiation.

428
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,850
We have to tell the children.

429
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,140
The children know.

430
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,380
How do they know?

431
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,870
What's going on?

432
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,680
Am I dying?

433
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,470
The cancer is serious, but --

434
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,810
Ruby, we'd like to talk to you outside.

435
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,520
I'll be right back.

436
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,220
The problem isn't how you said no.

437
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,780
The problem is how you said yes.

438
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,220
She seemed quite happy with the yes.

439
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,310
It came too quickly.

440
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,850
You made her think she was helping you

441
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,240
instead of the other way around, so she came asking for more,

442
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,010
feeling she was entitled to more.

443
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,760
So I should have said no when I wanted to say yes?

444
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,530
You shouldn't tell her what you want to tell her.

445
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,650
You should tell her what she needs to hear.

446
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,660
See, it's your job to figure out what you can give them,

447
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,400
convince them that's what they need,

448
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,450
and then make them feel like they owe you.

449
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,500
N-none of that sounds like me.

450
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,470
And you want to do the job your way,

451
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,940
without changing who you are?

452
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,970
- Is that amusing to you? - Yes, I do.

453
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,630
Yesterday, you were an attending.

454
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,530
Today, you're Chief.

455
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,580
You are a different person.

456
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,830
Want an espresso?

457
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,230
Without surgery,

458
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,950
your husband would probably live another two to five years.

459
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,410
He would have very little discomfort

460
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,160
until very close to the end, and that can be managed.

461
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,970
- You said it was treatable. - It is.

462
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,950
But fighting cancer's never easy.

463
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,380
We have to weigh the benefits against the suffering,

464
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,730
and the surgery itself is usually the easiest part.

465
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,150
He's strong. He's healthy.

466
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,860
He's not healthy. Not mentally.

467
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,020
And the burden on you --

468
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,050
I am not letting my husband die

469
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,340
because caring for him is inconvenient,

470
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,100
because I'm gonna have to repeat a conversation.

471
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,800
Just go to hell.

472
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,230
This type of surgery's never been done for this condition.

473
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,220
We'd be dealing with every one of your abdominal organs,

474
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,330
and something could go wrong with any of them.

475
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,860
You could be on dialysis for the rest of your life.

476
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,370
You could have a very compromised digestive tract,

477
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,220
lifelong diabetes.

478
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,220
You could have liver failure.

479
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,630
That's not a complete list.

480
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,120
You could die.

481
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,440
And, um...

482
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,990
if we don't do the surgery?

483
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,890
Chemotherapy and radiation.

484
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:42,360
Although the likelihood of success is slim, about 25%.

485
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,350
You may prefer hospice care.

486
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,170
You'd probably live maybe a year,

487
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,120
but it'd be a good year.

488
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,940
Could you give us some time to think about it?

489
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,500
Of course.

491
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,130
We're supposed to be at lunch.

492
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,270
We're gonna be late.

493
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,880
Why?

494
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,510
Why? Because I need meaning in my life.

495
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,810
Your heart seems fine.

496
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,450
Your liver...seems to be in the right place.

497
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,980
You're a brain surgeon.

498
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,090
You don't think you can get meaning being a brain surgeon?

499
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,870
This is a boring patient with boring symptoms.

500
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,140
Shaun, meet Marco Higgins,

501
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,310
diesel mechanic, currently in between jobs.

502
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,340
Three sons, two of whom he hasn't spoken to in quite some time,

503
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,530
but he's working on that.

504
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,510
Open.

505
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,630
Wide.

506
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,670
It's good to get to know people, Shaun.

507
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,020
It makes you a better doctor.

508
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,110
Say, "Ah."

509
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,220
You have boring symptoms. That's a good thing.

510
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,680
You do not want exciting symptoms.

511
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,040
You had a date last night, didn't you?

512
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,940
I want to hear about this.

513
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,750
Marco, you want to hear about this?

514
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,070
Yes, please.

515
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,630
- Yes, please. - Open.

516
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,730
It was a disaster.

517
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,880
Oh, thank you, Shaun, but it's really not --

518
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,470
No, it's polite and chivalrous...

519
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,320
...and even though chivalry is a problematic notion,

520
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,540
politeness is a good thing, no matter which --

521
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,240
Shaun!

522
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,560
Are you okay? Oh, my.

523
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,180
I'm okay. She might not be okay.

524
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,020
- No, I am okay. - Okay. Don't get up.

525
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,600
I'm pretty sure she's okay.

526
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,920
Take off his boots.

527
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,970
What?

528
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,160
Do you think Marco's diabetic?

529
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,730
Based on the color of his skin in the crease of his neck, I do.

530
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,060
Based on what it says on his chart, I do, too.

531
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,320
He could have an infection in his feet,

532
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,550
and the pain is being masked by diabetic neuropathy.

533
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,470
That infection could be causing the abdominal symptoms.

534
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,900
Marco, would you mind taking off your boots?

535
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,840
I was wrong. It's not boring.

536
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,370
I can do it myself.

537
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,770
I'm sure, but our job here is to help each other,

538
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,940
and today I didn't do that.

539
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,510
I'm trying to make up for that with a jar of pickles.

540
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,430
I overstepped and...

541
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,370
undercut you in front of the patient's wife.

542
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,550
I accept your apology.

543
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,240
What I should have done

544
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,880
was privately tell you that you're wrong.

545
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,380
- Give me the jar back. - And let you, as lead doctor,

546
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,650
tell them that this surgery's a bad idea.

547
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,000
Because we should let a 70-year-old man die

548
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,100
of a treatable condition?

549
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,080
Because we shouldn't condemn a 70-year-old man

550
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,970
to years of confusion and fear.

551
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,290
His life still has value.

552
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Seriously?

553
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,330
He has memory issues. He's not a vegetable.

554
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,850
He's funny, he's charming.

555
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,500
They've lived a life together.

556
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,510
He brings happiness to his wife, to his children.

557
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,090
He's happy.

558
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,190
Exactly.

559
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,440
Let him stay happy for whatever time he has left.

560
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,050
Nurse Petringa.

561
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,140
I'm sorry if I overstepped.

562
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,000
I didn't track you down for an apology.

563
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,880
You gonna get us the additional staff?

564
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,280
No.

565
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,490
If I get you the additional staff,

566
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,300
you lose hours, you lose overtime.

567
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,030
So you're doing us a favor

568
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,070
by making sure we never see our families?

569
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,760
Your problem isn't the staff.

570
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,510
Your problem is the actual work,

571
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,390
the crap part of the work that takes too long

572
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,740
and too many of you.

573
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,600
I authorized the purchase of two Hoya patient lifts

574
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,520
and a mechatronic ICU bed.

575
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,070
A smart bed?

576
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,460
Those are actually supposed to be kind of fun.

577
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,580
You got to promise to let me try it.

578
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,540
You got it.

579
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,180
Dr. Lim?

580
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,270
Thank you.

581
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,220
You owe me.

582
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,330
I'm well aware of what he'll be going through.

583
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,660
My sister had cancer.

584
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,800
The chemo, the radiation...

585
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,520
They beat the crap out of her, didn't they?

586
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:26,890
Yeah.

587
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,330
Now imagine going through that

588
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,690
and not understanding, every day.

589
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,370
Throwing up and not knowing why,

590
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,160
losing your hair and not knowing why,

591
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,600
learning he has cancer and being devastated by it

592
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,410
day after day.

593
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,610
But at the end...

594
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,490
There are no guarantees.

595
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,120
He's old, and his body's breaking down.

596
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,420
His mind is breaking down,

597
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,410
and it's gonna end, no matter what we do.

598
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,090
In 45 years, I have never once lied to him.

599
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,430
When memory goes, all that's left is emotion.

600
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,670
What we've learned doesn't matter.

601
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,410
What we had for lunch, where we went for vacation,

602
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,360
none of it matters.

603
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,270
But how we feel...

604
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,080
who we're close to...

605
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,670
He's the same man I've always loved.

606
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,600
Same sense of humor.

607
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,950
Same everything.

608
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,850
He hasn't changed.

609
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,440
And what I owe him hasn't changed.

610
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,820
Have you decided?

611
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,710
Not yet.

612
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,020
Take your time. There is no urgency to --

613
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,760
What are you waiting for?

614
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,070
Dr. Murphy, they are kind of facing

615
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,120
an impossible choice.

616
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,480
But they have to make it.

617
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,770
What additional information are you waiting for?

618
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,540
- Shaun... - I'll be a better doctor

619
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,160
if I understand the patient.

620
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,080
True, but right now,

621
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,810
your skills are secondary to their --

622
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,030
Are you debating whether you should find somebody else

623
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,380
to fall in love with, someone healthy?

624
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,670
No. No, of course not.

625
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:53,720
You should be.

626
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,030
We're kids.

627
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,910
You shouldn't have to spend the rest of your life

628
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,770
taking care of an invalid.

629
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,850
You think that's the issue?

630
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,880
Me? A-a burden on me?

631
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,090
This is so much easier on me than you.

632
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,240
No, it's not.

633
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,270
Whatever happens to me is gonna happen,

634
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,120
and I have to live with it.

635
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,060
You...

636
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,360
you have a choice.

637
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,530
"In sickness and in health."

638
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,260
That was the commitment I made...

639
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,670
this morning.

640
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,510
Now, if this had happened yesterday...

641
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,840
So...it's not

642
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,300
that difficult a decision then, right?

643
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,050
I guess not.

644
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,680
I can feel her humeral head outside the glenoid fossa.

645
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,400
It's an anterior dislocation.

646
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,230
I can reduce that.

647
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:46,930
Here?

648
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,360
Yes, with traction and external rotation.

649
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,130
Oh, my, that -- that -- that feels better.

650
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,330
I bumped you.

651
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,740
Oh, d-d-don't worry.

652
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,320
It happens. I-I wasn't watching, either.

653
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,470
Come on.

654
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,470
That's it?

655
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,900
You bumped into a very understanding woman,

656
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,430
you amazingly caught a bottle of wine.

657
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,570
Where was the disaster?

658
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,240
Unclamp the superior mesenteric to perfuse the organs.

659
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,590
The small intestines look dusky and cyanotic.

660
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,690
We'll need to resect all the necrotic segments.

661
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,690
Claire, find the first viable part of the ilium

662
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,200
and clamp proximal to it.

663
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,070
I don't think your irons in the fire are very hot.

664
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,440
Any job interviews you get, 

665
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,070
you're gonna spend a large chunk of time trying to explain

666
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,430
why you lasted less than a year as President at St. Bonaventure.

667
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,510
I mean, how do you put a positive spin on

668
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,630
why you spent a fortune on a Chief of Surgery

669
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,750
you fired weeks later to protect a second-year resident?

670
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,850
You think I made a mistake?

671
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,580
No, I think you did the right thing.

672
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,720
I admire you, which is why I want to do you a favor.

673
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,740
What you need to do is prove that you haven't burned any bridges,

674
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,760
which means you have to come back to work at St. Bonaventure.

675
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,100
As what? As a surgeon working for you?

676
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,110
And the fact that you're undoubtedly in need 

677
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,910
of a surgical attending to replace yourself

678
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,700
is just a coincidence?

679
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,070
It's what you need.

680
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,580
I admire the effort.

681
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,660
But don't con a con man.

682
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,540
Your greatest strength and your greatest weakness

683
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,420
as a leader was your stubbornness.

684
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,540
Don't let it be a weakness today.

685
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,990
My back hurts on the left side.

686
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,310
That's where you had your biopsy.

687
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,880
It's gonna hurt for a little while.

688
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,080
What biopsy?

689
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,560
Harvey, you came in here because you thought you had kidney stones.

690
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,740
We did some imaging, and you don't.

691
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,310
What is it? What... what's wrong?

692
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:38,470
What? What's going on, Ruby?

693
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,380
I...

694
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,190
Why isn't anybody saying anything?

695
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,110
Am I dying?

696
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,250
Ruby?

697
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,900
I...I can't die.

698
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,780
I need to take care of you.

699
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,850
I...I can't...

700
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,130
They didn't find stones.

701
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,190
Everything is okay.

702
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,190
The pain will go away.

703
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,500
We're gonna go home tonight.

704
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,980
Okay? Okay?

705
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,910
I had a nice time.

706
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,060
That's it?

707
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,110
It's over?

708
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,860
Where's the disaster?

709
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,850
I've listened to an hour of this.

710
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,210
I was promised a disaster.

711
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,890
Where's the disaster?

712
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,870
It...was exhausting.

713
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,470
Everything was always out of control.

714
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,990
Anything could happen at any time.

715
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,300
Anything did.

716
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,790
There was too much to remember to do,

717
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,440
too much to remember not to do, and none of it made sense.

718
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,310
It was hard, uncomfortable, unpleasant.

719
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,350
I spent the whole evening doing unnatural things

720
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,290
to make her happy, and I have no idea if she was happy,

721
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,360
and I know I wasn't happy.

722
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,460
It was all a disaster.

723
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,930
I want you to meet our new attending, Dr. Marcus Andrews.

724
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,360
Pleasure to meet you.

725
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,900
How long have you been working here?

726
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,300
Ms. McDougal?

727
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,770
She didn't ask for ID.

728
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,590
It's policy.

729
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,170
We take a lot of immigrants here.

730
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,610
She also didn't look at me.

731
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,470
Check the symptom I told her I had...

732
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,720
A cut over the left eye.

733
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,190
You heal very nicely, Ms. McDougal.

734
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,510
You hate it here.

735
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,600
"Hate" is a strong word.

736
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,880
What would you do differently?

737
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,250
Give me five things.

738
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,700
Diabetes clinical educator, onsite lab and X-ray,

739
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,170
mental health advisor, multidisciplinary care team,

740
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,800
electronic medical records.

741
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,630
We had the clinic at the hospital

742
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,280
and had to shut it down because it was a money pit.

743
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,700
Come back as President, and we'll re-open it.

744
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,790
Your office can be in the clinic.

745
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,360
Do I have to wear a tie?

746
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,420
Welcome back.

747
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,080
Am I okay?

748
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,820
The surgery went very well.

749
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,060
We're confident that we got all of the cancer.

750
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,690
There's a bag by her side.

751
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,900
Is that just to drain stuff post-surgery?

752
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,180
There were complications.

753
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,790
We had to remove a large portion of your bowel

754
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,280
and divert the waste through a stoma in your skin.

755
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,070
That's an ileostomy bag.

756
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,200
How long will I have that?

757
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,620
Forever.

758
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,920
So I have to go to the bathroom

759
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,790
in this thing for the rest of my life?

760
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,900
Yes.

761
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,890
We'll teach you how to change it,

762
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,320
how to dispose of it.

763
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,550
They'll teach both of us.

764
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,730
Now, this is why we do it, Shaun.

765
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,750
Every date is a disaster.

766
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,790
Every relationship is out of control.

767
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:38,920
But if you stick with it, you wind up with someone in your life 

768
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,710
who will help you when you need to be helped,

769
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,280
love you when you do not feel lovable,

770
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,640
be with you no matter what.

771
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,710
It's not worth it.

772
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,550
Hi, Mom.

773
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,170
My son's coming to town.

774
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,750
Think I'll pick him up at the airport.

775
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:17,000
