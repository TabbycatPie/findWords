18
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,750
Your primary care doctor was right.

19
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,690
The mass is on the smaller side.

20
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,200
We'll confirm with the new images,

21
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,410
but it should be manageable with medication.

22
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,640
No surgery needed.

23
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,280
Well, my fiance will be so relieved.

24
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,370
He's been worried i'll look like Frankenstein in all our photos.

25
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,640
Also that I might die.

26
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,290
When's the big day?

27
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,520
June.

28
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,980
You've been dealing with wedding planning

29
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,950
on top of a pituitary tumor?

30
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,260
You deserve a medal.

31
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,680
Our medical record system, on the other hand,

32
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,380
it has you listed as female.

33
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,000
Probably because of the Pap smears.

34
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,720
Software clearly needs a trans update. Deep breath.

35
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,180
I'll fix it so everything is correct going forward.

36
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,240
Please confirm your gender and pronouns.

37
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,200
Male, he/him/his. Thanks for asking.

38
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,080
We're the ones with the messed-up software.

39
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,610
Your scans from this morning were just uploaded.

40
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,180
In less than two weeks, the tumor's doubled in size.

41
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,700
{\an7}BGM: Can't Take My Eyes Off You by Bob Crew, Bob Guadio

42
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,180
You're just too good to be true

43
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,700
I can't take my eyes off of you

44
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,880
You'd be like heaven to touch...

45
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,680
34-year-old female, Zara Norton.

46
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,310
Tachycardic and delirious.

47
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,840
Dr. Guerin, update vitals.

48
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,680
Dr. Wolke, draw blood for CBC and electrolytes.

49
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,010
Now that I've found you, stay

50
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,790
Pupils are dilated, but reactive.

51
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,810
Ms. Norton, smells like you've had some marijuana?

52
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,730
Mmm-mmm. I just unloaded a shipment at the dispensary.

53
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,310
Test for THC

54
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,150
and a full tox screen.

55
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,330
I am a peddler.

56
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,960
Not a user.

57
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,640
Run it.

58
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,010
BP's elevated, 180 over 115.

59
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,070
That could explain the delirium.

60
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,670
Ooh, that sound high. Better take my meds.

61
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,160
See, I never miss a... Oh, no.

62
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,120
Oh, no, that's not it.

63
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,730
BP's climbing, 210 over 120.

64
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,860
Enalaprilat, 1.25 milligrams, IV.

65
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,450
Ms. Norton, do you remember the name of your medication?

66
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,460
You can call me Zara.

67
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,320
See? It say right here on the...

68
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,880
Okay, forget about the meds. She is not taking any.

69
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,690
This is untreated chronic hypertension.

70
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,260
What if you're wrong? 

71
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,050
What if she's on a loop diuretic for her pressure?

72
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,480
This could cause renal failure.

73
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,010
She's heading into hypertensive crisis.

74
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,340
What if we try an angiotensin receptor blocker?

75
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,250
No drug interaction.

76
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,440
Angiotensin receptor blockers work too slowly.

79
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,430
BP's going down.

80
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,020
Nice call.

83
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,180
Latest budget report.

84
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,130
Yeah, the PDF's sitting in my inbox.

85
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,110
I'm trying to ignore it.

86
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,580
And thus...

87
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,390
A sit-down visit?

88
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,110
Just checking in, see how you're doing.

89
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,750
Okay. You?

90
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,850
Me? I'm... recovering from the year,

91
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,580
like everybody else.

92
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,210
Pandemic, the surge.

93
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,560
You were here for every minute of every day.

94
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,980
It must have taken a toll.

95
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,410
It... comes with the territory.

96
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,430
You're not, uh, stressed or distracted?

97
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,840
I'm... tired.

98
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,340
Okay. Well, maybe you should take some time off.

99
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,210
No.

100
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,500
But thank you. I'm fine.

101
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,240
You don't seem fine.

102
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,800
Are there issues with my work performance?

103
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,900
No, you do great work.

104
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,740
Then I'm not sure why we're having this conversation.

105
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,130
Because I'm worried about you.

106
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,850
Because other people are worried about you.

107
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,290
There's no shame in struggling a little bit.

108
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,230
You know, what would be weird is

109
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,470
if you didn't struggle at all.

110
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,610
If you need to see someone, the hospital will cover the cost.

111
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,180
Great. You'll pay my bills.

112
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,800
And the damage to my reputation, who takes care of that?

113
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,520
I don't think that seeing a therapist

114
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,140
will affect your career.

115
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,040
Says the white guy.

116
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,330
Okay.

117
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,680
Privacy protections are there for a reason.

118
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,970
No one needs to know.

119
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,170
Thank you for checking in.

120
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,100
- How you feeling? - Good.

121
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,910
Be better when I understand what landed me up in here.

122
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,140
You had an acute hypertensive crisis.

123
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,750
Oh, I know my blood pressure's high.

124
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,930
I'm already on medication for it.

125
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,400
You probably wanna know what it is.

126
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,300
There's no medication.

127
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,070
We need to do an echocardiogram

128
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,290
to make sure your heart wasn't damaged in the crisis.

129
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,440
Fine by me.

130
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,830
Here's 10% discount

131
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,940
on any purchase over $50 or more at Z & B Naturals.

132
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,700
I'm Z. B is my partner Bill.

133
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,620
You're surrounded by pot all day, every day,

134
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,030
but you never touch the stuff?

135
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,310
How? Why?

136
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,710
It's just never been my thing.

137
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,460
The name always trips me up.

138
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,700
Chlorthalidone.

139
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,550
That's for hypertension.

140
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,040
Yeah, bottle seems pretty full.

141
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,130
How long have you been on this?

142
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,940
About six months. Just refilled it.

143
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,140
Take it every day.

144
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,440
Smile.

145
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,670
Head tilt.

146
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,190
Now he smiles.

147
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,010
Burst of laughter.

148
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,140
Yeah.

149
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,990
Rio Gutierrez, 29,

150
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,180
pituitary mass went from manageable with meds

151
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,430
to likely surgery.

152
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,210
So, talking to the new radiology resident, huh?

153
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,150
I wanted Dr. D'Souza's opinion on an intriguing set of scans.

154
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,650
She is very talented.

155
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,660
You're crushing on her.

156
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,080
N... no.

157
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,030
I am not. I love Lea.

158
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,270
Well, those two things aren't mutually exclusive.

159
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,490
Mr. Gutierrez's blood has high levels of prolactin.

160
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,470
Prolactin is produced in the pituitary gland.

161
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,720
The tumor could be secreting it.

162
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,780
Or the tumor could be reacting to the high levels of hormones

163
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,700
being produced elsewhere in the body.

164
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,090
The patient is a transgender man.

165
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,600
Do an ultrasound.

166
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,260
Advance the probe until you see the cardiac chamber.

167
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,260
Maybe Zara has secondary hypertension

168
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,620
due to renal vascular disease.

169
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,800
She doesn't. Her creatinine is 1.2.

170
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,560
Her GFR is in normal range.

171
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,770
Well, that would make it unlikely, but not impossible.

172
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,410
It'd also explain

173
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,420
why her prescribed hypertension meds weren't working

174
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,660
and why she got better when you gave her that ACE inhibitor.

175
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,950
Mmm. Simpler explanation, she's not taking her meds.

176
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,130
Valve looks normal.

177
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,250
Should I move on to the two-chamber view?

178
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,190
Yeah.

179
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,270
We have no reason to think that she's lying.

180
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,860
She seems to be telling the truth about her pot usage.

181
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,640
No THC in her blood or urine.

182
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,960
She couldn't possibly be lying about something else.

183
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,320
The left ventricle is thickened,

184
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,980
which is consistent with untreated hypertension.

185
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,670
Heart rate's climbing.

186
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,690
Cardiac output is dropping.

187
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,060
Stroke volume as well.

188
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,550
She's in cardiogenic shock.

189
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,720
Would you mind if I did an ultrasound on your abdomen?

190
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,290
For a brain tumor?

191
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,900
This is my fiance, Eli Simpson.

192
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,500
When I heard about the new scans,

193
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,140
I kind of stormed the castle.

194
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,790
My hero.

195
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,590
Your prolactin levels are very high,

196
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,970
which might be caused by the tumor,

197
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,710
unless another condition raised your prolactin,

198
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,050
encouraging more growth.

199
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,040
What condition boosts prolactin?

200
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,820
Do you think I'm pregnant?

201
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,050
He can't be. He's on testosterone.

202
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,240
Except for a few weeks last month.

203
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,470
I forgot to take my shot before our trip.

204
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,850
But there's no way that...

205
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,780
You're pregnant.

206
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,070
You went into cardiogenic shock

207
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,300
because your heart wasn't pumping adequately.

208
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,700
We did a minor procedure and installed an Impella pump,

209
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,380
but it's a short-term solution.

210
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,390
I do feel a little out of breath.

211
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,940
But that might be just 'cause of you, Dr. Andrews.

212
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,160
Ms. Norton, I'm a married man and your doctor.

213
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,430
You have a rare condition.

214
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,190
Certain parts of your heart muscle

215
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,820
have become abnormally thick.

216
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,680
So, this wall in between the chambers, that's the septum.

217
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,900
That's a normal one.

218
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,210
This is what yours looks like.

219
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,170
It's gonna require surgery.

220
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,140
We're gonna run a few more tests to determine the best approach.

221
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,570
Wait. You gonna be my surgeon, Dr. Andrews?

222
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,760
I sure will.

223
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,210
And y'all two gonna be with him?

224
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,460
Yeah.

225
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,280
My lucky day.

226
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,950
Three doctors of color taking care of me.

227
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,330
Doctors who won't talk down to me.

228
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,530
Not exactly what I'm used to.

229
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,900
You guys know what I mean.

230
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,650
My mother made me wear a suit and tie

231
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,420
whenever we went to the pediatrician.

232
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,230
Put on your Sunday best

233
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,360
just to get on the scale and touch your toes.

234
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,200
Yeah. Made me so mad, I wound up becoming a doctor.

235
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,650
The testing confirmed

236
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,580
your tumor is a hormone-producing prolactinoma.

237
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,340
And the pregnancy is about six weeks along.

238
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,720
Do you consider yourself gay?

239
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,080
- I don't think that's... - Yes.

240
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,660
Because I am gay.

241
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,990
But you have vaginal intercourse with your fiance.

242
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,280
- That is how he got pregnant... - Dr. Murphy, that's enough.

243
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,750
- I... I just want... - I think you should leave.

244
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,160
I'm sorry.

245
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,200
That was completely inappropriate.

246
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,000
Our treatment plan for your tumor

247
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,300
depends on your plan for your pregnancy.

248
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,970
So...

249
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,700
We've talked about kids,

250
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,290
but I always figured that was way down the road.

251
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,230
And not this way.

252
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,620
I always assumed we'd adopt.

253
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,140
I'd have go off T, and stay off.

254
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,740
If Rio doesn't continue the pregnancy,

255
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
then what happens?

256
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,510
Your hormone levels would drop quickly,

257
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,410
which would cause the tumor to shrink.

258
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,120
After that, we'd use medication, possibly a minor surgery.

259
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,500
I'd like to terminate the pregnancy.

260
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,380
I looked over all of Zara's labs.

261
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,340
All signs point to her

262
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,750
taking her hypertension medicine regularly.

263
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,610
Her MRIs show significant ventricular septal thickness,

264
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,360
bad turbulence jet flow.

265
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,090
There's myocardial edema, too.

266
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,090
The ACE inhibitors were a bad call.

267
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,730
Which eventually sent our patient into cardiogenic shock.

268
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,270
Why'd you ignore what she was telling us?

269
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,950
I made a medical diagnosis

270
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,330
based on pattern processing

271
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,490
that we're taught in med school,

272
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,490
which involves considering, you know, race, education,

273
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,590
occupation, BMI.

274
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,330
Always sounded like profiling to me.

275
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,220
Yes, we have the rain,

276
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,130
but more impressively, the wind.

277
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,940
That rain's going to be coming in sideways.

278
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,540
Just take a look at how the wind increases

279
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,830
as we progress throughout the day.

280
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,290
So, this afternoon, we're talking about

281
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,100
50-mile-per-hour gusts possible.

282
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,480
Sorry for crashing.

283
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,720
Radiology doesn't have a TV.

284
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,850
You like The Weather Channel?

285
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,550
I find it soothing.

286
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,790
Would you like to join me?

287
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,490
And we have more intense rainfall coming through,

288
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,810
and that's going to also lead to some flood potential.

289
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,860
All of us are going to get into the action.

290
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,960
You got the mountains.

291
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,250
Would you mind if I lowered the volume by four output levels?

292
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,850
That would be perfect.

293
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,640
All the areas around here in Northern California,

294
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,570
Modesto, Stockton, Sacramento.

295
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,300
The northern part of San Francisco...

296
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,160
I find the reflection on the screen so distracting.

297
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,210
So do I.

298
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,660
Could I

299
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,170
do this?

300
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,130
Nurse paged me.

301
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,630
Is something wrong?

302
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,250
I've changed my mind.

303
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,570
I want to keep the baby.

304
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,090
Since you're continuing the pregnancy,

305
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,500
we'll need to surgically remove the prolactinoma.

306
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,020
So, you'll cut into his brain?

307
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,440
Our safest option is to go in through the nasal cavity

308
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,910
in what's known as a transsphenoidal surgery, TSS for short.

309
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,180
It's less invasive than our other option.

310
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,270
That still sounds dangerous.

311
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,120
I've made up my mind.

312
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,950
Do I get any say in this?

313
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,340
I'm all for us having a family, but I'm not ready to...

314
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,210
No one's ever ready for kids.

315
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,940
Yesterday, you said that you never considered getting pregnant,

316
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,230
and now you're willing to risk your life for it.

317
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,730
When I was about seven,

318
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,960
I had this one refuge.

319
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,300
I'd hang a quilt over a couple chairs

320
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,120
and hide out with my two buds,

321
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,570
Foxie the Fox and Fuzz the Lion,

322
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,800
and I'd imagine,

323
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:53,850
I was the dad.

324
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,670
And they were my twin little guys,

325
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,190
fraternal, obviously.

326
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,080
We were a family.

327
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,030
When I transitioned, I put that dream aside.

328
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,130
At least, as far as them coming from me.

329
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,050
But now...

330
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,940
whether we planned it or not,

331
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,380
this is our baby.

332
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,150
How soon can you do the surgery?

333
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,350
I'll order an image-guidance MRI to get things started.

334
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,520
Based on the cardiac MRI and catheterization,

335
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,330
there are two treatment options.

336
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,800
Myectomy, basically open heart surgery,

337
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,060
and alcohol septal ablation,

338
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,430
where we use the alcohol

339
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,030
to kill targeted sections of the heart muscle.

340
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,310
Well, what would you recommend?

341
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,120
The surgery is more invasive, tougher recovery,

342
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,930
but better efficacy long-term.

343
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,220
The ablation is less dangerous,

344
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,250
but you're more likely to need further medical interventions.

345
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,150
Now, you call that a recommendation?

346
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,270
There are pros and cons to both.

347
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,300
Uh, you'll need to weigh them.

348
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,210
I'll give you some time.

349
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,030
You always want to take care of people, Dr. Browne?

350
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,950
Pretty much.

351
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,040
Me, too.

352
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,700
Oh. Well, you run a marijuana dispensary.

353
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,690
It's not all about getting people high.

354
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,410
No, maybe not, but I'm guessing most of your clientele...

355
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,700
My Great-Aunt Lucy had pancreatic cancer.

356
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,690
A year, she hung on.

357
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,690
In agony.

358
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,800
Marijuana was the only thing that helped her eat or sleep.

359
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,850
Doctors didn't give her anything for the pain?

360
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,290
They suggested ibuprofen.

361
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,700
Now, you know doctors are 22% less likely

362
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,840
to give pain meds to Black patients

363
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,420
than to white patients with the same symptoms.

364
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,040
My point is, you and I, we're a lot alike.

365
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,460
We're both strong, Black women

366
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,290
finding our way in the world,

367
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,300
but one of us knows more about medicine than the other.

368
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,700
So, I'd like to know, what would you do in my situation?

369
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,080
The open myectomy is a bigger risk

370
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,140
but offers more long-term benefits.

371
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,840
I've made my decision.

372
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,130
I'm with you, Dr. Browne.

373
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,420
Book the myectomy.

374
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,080
Here's the Rio Gutierrez imaging for your upcoming TSS.

375
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,970
Set that on the table, please.

376
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,900
I, um...

377
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,630
I noted the tumor's suprasellar expansion

378
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,330
and surrounding edema and splaying of circle of Willis.

379
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,070
That is very helpful.

380
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,480
Bye, Dr. Murphy.

381
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,450
You're safe, Shaun. She's gone.

382
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,870
Not really.

383
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,970
Dr. D'Souza is still in my brain.

384
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,200
I don't like it.

385
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,890
We kissed.

386
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,880
- When? - What?

387
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,250
I have so many thoughts about her,

388
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,750
and I have so many questions I want to ask Rio.

389
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,340
Wouldn't he get more pleasure for...

390
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,700
Questions you're not supposed to ask him.

391
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,360
The kiss, Shaun. When did you kiss?

392
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,400
Last night. In my dream.

393
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,690
If I can't ask questions, how do I understand?

394
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,620
My... My brain...

395
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,010
My... My brain isn't behaving the way I want it to.

396
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,470
How do I make it stop?

397
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,520
You're attracted to Dr. D'Souza.

398
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,210
Why does that bother you?

399
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,390
When I was with Carly and had feelings for Lea,

400
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,030
it meant I was supposed to be with Lea.

401
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,960
What if this means I'm supposed to be with Dr. D'Souza?

402
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,310
No. You've loved Lea for years.

403
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,370
This is just... attraction.

404
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,560
But shouldn't loving Lea make it go away?

405
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,120
Relationships would be a lot easier if it worked that way.

406
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,060
You're feeling guilty.

407
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,970
I say take Lea out for a nice dinner, something special.

408
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,560
And tell her about my crush.

409
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,290
I need to let Lea know.

410
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,940
- No, definitely not. - No, you do not.

411
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:32,950
I want to get your thoughts

412
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,010
on the suprasellar extension of the tumor for this TSS.

413
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,240
You remember Sarah Pepper?

414
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Runs nephrology at S.F. Regional?

415
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,010
Always wears a shawl?

416
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,460
So, during the staff meeting last week, she fell apart.

417
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,710
Screaming, crying in front of the whole department. Totally nuts.

418
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,210
Rough day at the office.

419
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,150
Wonder how you'd approach and resect without getting a CSF leak.

420
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,880
Place a lumbar drain,

421
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,230
then infuse saline and do Valsalva maneuver.

422
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,280
Okay.

423
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,470
Apparently, Pepper's meltdown was so over the top,

424
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,620
the hospital forced her to take a leave.

425
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,490
- How long? - Unspecified.

426
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,980
She's always been a little crazy.

427
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,960
Last I checked, eccentric and emotional didn't qualify as crazy.

428
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,520
Thanks for taking a look.

429
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,350
I read that cisgender people

430
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,470
often reduce transgender people to their genitalia,

431
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,980
and that that is offensive.

432
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,450
Did I do that to you and Rio?

433
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,970
Yes.

434
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,670
I'm sorry.

435
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,230
Rio will be going into surgery soon.

436
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,020
He's been asking for you.

437
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,860
You haven't been answering your phone.

438
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,880
Thanks for letting me know.

439
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,240
He is very confusing to me, too.

440
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,130
Rio has worked so hard,

441
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,810
he had a bilateral subcutaneous mastectomy

442
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,790
and takes hormone replacement therapy,

443
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,910
but now he is choosing 

444
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,230
the most female act.

445
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,400
It's not female if Rio's doing it.

446
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,330
Y-Yes.

447
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,670
And he must have dealt with a lot of prejudice

448
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,480
during his transition.

449
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,200
I dealt with prejudice.

450
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,290
My brother helped me. Does he have a brother?

451
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,890
His family doesn't talk to him.

452
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,470
And now Rio is having brain surgery.

453
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,970
He is very brave.

454
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,510
You can stay here.

455
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,370
I have a patient, Zara Norton.

456
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,690
We, uh -- We diagnosed her with HOCM.

457
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,220
I saw the file.

458
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,130
Dr. Guerin expressed some concerns about 

459
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,390
my initial handling of the case in the ER.

460
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,970
He thinks I stereotyped her based on her race.

461
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,120
Do you think you did?

462
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,240
She was crashing.

463
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,820
I had to make a call. I didn't have a lot to go on.

464
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,970
Glassman came to see me this morning.

465
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,600
Someone told him I'm unstable and need help.

466
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,850
Any idea where he heard that?

467
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,100
I asked for help. You can, too.

468
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,590
You're a resident. No one cares if you need help.

469
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,790
I got this job in part

470
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,430
because my main competition, 

471
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,840
a man, backed me.

472
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,270
The second anyone thinks I can't handle this --

473
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,400
No one is gonna think that --

474
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,550
They will if you keep telling them I'm a mess.

475
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,700
You have PTSD.

476
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,340
You shouldn't be ashamed.

477
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,460
Says the women who just profiled a Black female patient.

478
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,340
You judged her,

479
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,830
just like people will judge me

480
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,500
and whisper that I've always been a little intense,

481
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,170
so no wonder I was asked to step down.

482
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,450
Nobody needs to know.

483
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,340
Exactly.

484
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,690
You tell me that it doesn't matter.

485
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,570
You tell me everyone will understand,

486
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,030
and then you tell me to keep it to myself.

487
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,110
Should I be ashamed, or shouldn't I be?

488
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,500
Alright, Ms. Norton, time to head to pre-op.

489
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,850
What's in the bag, handsome?

490
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,960
I like to know what goes into my body.

491
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,460
Uh, cefazolin. It's a prophylactic antibiotic

492
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,680
we give before surgeries.

493
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,740
Makes sense.

494
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,430
Hey, what was the med y'all gave me

495
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,780
when I first got here to the ER?

496
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,590
Enalaprilat. It's an ACE inhibitor.

497
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,820
Isn't that for hypertension?

498
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,330
But I thought I already told y'all

499
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,160
I was on meds for my blood pressure.

500
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,310
You did.

501
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,430
So, you figured I needed more?

502
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,150
Or did you not believe me?

503
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,600
I'm sorry.

504
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,860
You must be scared.

505
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,670
You shouldn't have to be scared alone.

506
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,550
I love you.

507
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,700
I love you, too.

508
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,390
Eli.

509
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,630
I can't see you.

510
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,730
I'm right here, babe.

511
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,660
Can you follow this with your eyes?

512
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,040
It keeps disappearing.

513
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,540
You've lost peripheral vision.

514
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,520
The tumor is impinging on the optic fibers.

515
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,190
We can't perform the TSS surgery.

516
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,970
With the tumor's continued growth,

517
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,930
the best remaining option is the open pterional craniotomy.

518
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,360
But it is higher risk with a lengthier recovery.

519
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,440
All of which is on top of the potential for 

520
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,740
gender dysphoria during pregnancy.

521
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,770
Is that still a concern?

522
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,840
I think back to before I started taking T,

523
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,090
how terrible that felt.

524
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,960
The thought of feeling that all over again...

525
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,270
We could go back to the original plan.

526
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,990
You mean terminate the pregnancy?

527
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,190
The tumor should shrink on its own.

528
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,000
After everything you've done to get where you are in your life,

529
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,590
it's scary to think about

530
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,610
doing something that would put that at risk.

531
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,120
This is my next step.

532
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,420
I'm ready to take it, even if I'm scared.

533
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,470
You have to take risks sometimes, Dr. Lim.

534
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,040
Thank you.

535
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,550
Shouldn't you be prepping Zara for surgery?

536
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,830
It's canceled.

537
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,420
She wants to be transferred to a different hospital.

538
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,200
One where she won't be "Racially profiled into heart failure."

539
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,950
Shaun, you okay?

540
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,230
I am having thoughts I don't want to have.

541
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,070
Both Park and Jordan say I shouldn't tell you.

542
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,880
But you're going to, aren't you?

543
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,550
Yes, I am.

544
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,420
I have a work crush.

545
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,860
Also, my patient is a pregnant trans man --

546
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,680
Okay, one at a time, Shaun.

547
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,560
About this...crush?

548
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,170
Her name is Dr. Cintia D'Souza.

549
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,860
She is a second year radiology resident.

550
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,270
Last night, I dreamed we were in the Residents' Lounge,

551
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,620
watching The Weather Channel, and then we started kissing --

552
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,310
Okay, I got it.

553
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,400
Are you mad?

554
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,330
Park and Jordan were right. I shouldn't have told you.

555
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,000
No. I'm not mad.

556
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,940
A little surprised, but that's okay.

557
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm still attracted...

558
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,300
to other guys sometimes.

559
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,100
N-No.

560
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,480
No. What? Who?

561
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,680
- It doesn't matter. - ‭Who?

562
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,140
There -- Okay, there is this one physical therapist --

563
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,010
N-No.

564
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,960
No.

565
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,170
No.

566
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,440
What if we're attracted to other people

567
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,080
because there is something wrong with our relationship?

568
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,140
You're not planning on kissing Dr. D'Souza in real life?

569
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,100
No.

570
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,260
Or working late with her,

571
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,600
doing some X-rays alone,

572
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,610
where you might end up leaning over the same light box --

573
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,960
We don't use light boxes anymore.

574
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,850
And I don't plan to work late with her.

575
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,590
Then I don't think either of us

576
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,300
has anything to be worried about.

577
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,010
I have to go prep for a pterional craniotomy.

578
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,350
I'm Dr. Glassman, president of the hospital.

579
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,570
Unless you're here to drive me to S.F.Regional,

580
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,730
you can head right back on out.

581
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,110
I apologize for your experience in the emergency room.

582
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,430
That's mighty white of you.

583
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,980
I don't recommend that you transfer to S.F.Regional,

584
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,610
or any other hospital, for that matter.

585
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,750
I'm sure they got the same fancy equipment,

586
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,160
same shiny sets of diplomas y'all got here,

587
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,540
and maybe a few less racist doctors.

588
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,150
Well, apparently, that doesn't seem to be the case.

589
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,600
I pulled data on comparable hospitals

590
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,640
within 100 miles,

591
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,690
did numbers on surgical outcomes

592
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,460
and patient satisfaction aggregated by race.

593
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,380
Apparently, we're doing well, comparatively.

594
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,280
Your argument is that your hospital may be racially biased,

595
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,870
but it's less racially biased than these other hospitals?

596
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah. Pretty much.

597
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,830
Stay at St. Bonaventure,

598
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,720
the president of the hospital will monitor your care

599
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,780
every step of the way.

600
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,310
For whatever it's worth,

601
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,280
I don't think you can do better than that.

602
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,940
She's gonna stay, on one condition.

603
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,090
That you're off the team.

604
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,120
Dr. Park, please open Sylvian fissure.

605
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,270
Arachnoid knife and Rhoton dissector.

606
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,070
Tumor is visible.

607
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,850
What makes someone a man?

608
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,700
I thought it was just the chromosomes,

609
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,960
but that must not be it,

610
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,600
which makes things confusing and difficult,

611
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,020
and I know Rio was uncomfortable when he --

612
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,640
Life is uncomfortable.

613
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,200
It hits you with tough situations

614
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,190
and you muscle through them.

615
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,290
I see a tiny bleed in the circular sinus.

616
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,160
Pack it with Floseal.

617
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,160
Someone give me an update.

618
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,080
We got a drop in end tidal CO2 and oxygen sat.

619
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,880
See any evidence of exposed air cells?

620
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,860
No. But waxing bone edges just to be safe.

621
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,670
But the tumor thinned the sellar floor and sphenoid wall.

622
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,240
Making it permeable to oxygen.

623
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,150
It's an air embolism.

624
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,860
BP's dropping.

625
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,620
Dr. Lim, what should we do?

626
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,230
Saline gauze,

627
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,670
tilt the table to eliminate the negative air pressure gradient,

628
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,630
and place a central line.

629
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,740
This will stop the air leak

630
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,390
and allow us to access the air bubble.

631
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,490
Inserting Bunegin air-aspirating cath.

632
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,670
You are 2 centimeters from the superior vena cava.

633
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,600
Aspirate the right atrium

634
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,780
until you don't see any more air bubbles.

635
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,400
Nice save, Dr. Lim.

636
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,410
Let's get this tumor out.

637
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,680
Make your transverse aortotomy

638
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,170
with Potts scissors, Dr. Wolke.

639
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,740
Extending the muscular incision

640
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,000
down to the mid-ventricle.

641
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,920
There's the myectomy site.

642
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,630
There's the aberrant muscle bundle.

643
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,230
Get her off bypass,

644
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,410
see how she does.

645
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,260
How's the cardiac output?

646
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,300
Reduced and insufficient.

647
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,460
Low output could mean we need to further reduce the septum.

648
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,270
Unless it means that we reduced it too much.

649
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,110
Damaged the cardiac electrical conductors

650
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,240
that control the heart rate.

651
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,260
She's having third-degree heart block.

652
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,920
Enrique's right.

653
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,040
We took too much muscle.

654
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,630
Put her back on bypass.

655
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,910
We could augment the wall with a bovine patch.

656
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,540
Still wouldn't insulate the electrical system.

657
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,420
She'd still be at risk of complete heart block

658
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,500
and cardiac arrest.

659
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,760
We could insert a dual chamber pacer.

660
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,500
She won't need the conduction system in the wall of her heart

661
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,590
to control her heart rate.

662
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,450
Let's go!

663
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,560
How was the craniotomy?

664
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,160
It went well.

665
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,380
The patient is in recovery.

666
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,290
Your text said you have good news.

667
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,840
And by good news, I mean bad news for Dr. D'Souza.

668
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,400
Plenty of great stuff to crush a crush.

669
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,340
First observation --

670
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,270
She smells like cinnamon.

671
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,980
Which is more puzzling than irritating.

672
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,320
Actually kind of nice. Which is obviously not helpful.

673
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:43,330
Oh, okay. She does this weird self-grooming gesture

674
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,130
where she tucks her hair behind her ear.

675
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,850
And then sorta massages her ear.

676
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,830
A-Also n-not helpful.

677
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,470
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

678
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,140
Okay. At the salad bar,

679
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,200
she used the cucumber tongs to reach for the cucumbers...

680
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,010
and then the tomatoes.

681
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,880
And the olives.

682
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,560
And the pickles.

684
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,040
I can see all of you.

685
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,670
How'd -- How'd we do?

686
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,040
Great.

687
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,840
We got all of the mass, vision is restored.

688
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,990
You have every reason to expect a full recovery

689
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,170
and a healthy pregnancy.

690
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,850
We're gonna be dads.

691
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,820
Are you ready?

692
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,550
I've never been a pregnant man before.

693
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,700
You'll always be the best man that I've ever known.

694
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,060
Came to see how you were doing.

695
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,860
Dr. Andrews told me

696
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,960
you was the one who figured out how to save me.

697
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,800
Still don't change what went down earlier, though.

698
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,960
When I got to med school...

699
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,610
people took one look at me

700
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,830
and they thought they knew exactly who I was.

701
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,000
Black girl on financial aid.

702
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,370
She must not be that smart.

703
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,130
She must have gotten a lot of breaks.

704
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,720
She'll probably need a lot more.

705
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,160
And I worked...

706
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,430
I worked so hard

707
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,860
to prove them wrong,

708
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,900
that I wasn't who they thought I was,

709
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,510
that I deserved to be there,

710
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,260
that I ...That I fit in.

711
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,070
When you came into the ER...

712
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,180
loud and messy...

713
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,600
I saw...

714
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:04,730
I saw everything I have tried hard not to be.

715
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,650
And I think it made me angry.

716
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,140
And I'm ashamed of that.

717
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,510
And I'm really sorry.

718
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,090
I used to be that way.

719
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,760
But I got tired of working that hard

720
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,380
to make white people comfortable.

721
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,330
You two heading out for the night?

722
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,670
We sure are.

723
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,520
How did the craniotomy go, Shaun?

724
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,000
Did you guys get all the prolactinoma?

725
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,250
Yes.

726
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,350
Is that cafeteria salad?

727
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,620
Are there pickles in there?

728
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,840
Did you want some?

729
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,070
You know, I'm good. Thank you.

730
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,720
Shaun, did you...

731
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,550
No, thank you.

732
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,940
It does help to focus

733
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,000
on her irresponsible salad bar practices

734
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,540
and dietary preferences.

735
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,880
I've got a ton of strategies to manage discomfort.

736
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,170
So do I.

737
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,140
To replenish your supply, and a peace offering.

738
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,890
I wasn't aware we were at war.

739
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,630
Well, seemed like my gossip about Pepper

740
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,950
kind of landed wrong.

741
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,500
Bad day.

742
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,260
Sorry to crash the party.

743
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,550
Dr. Glassman wanted me to show this to you two.

744
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,730
I asked Lea to run some numbers on various metrics by race,

745
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,020
and the results are not great,

746
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,880
especially when it comes to pain management.

747
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,390
We are under-treating

748
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,790
African-American and Latinx patients

749
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,880
by a considerable margin.

750
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,150
I think I need a little of that peace offering.

751
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,310
Help yourself.

752
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,720
Anyone else?

753
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,060
No. Thank you.

754
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,790
Uh...me, neither.

755
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,700
I...

756
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,810
started taking sertraline.

757
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,700
For PTSD.

758
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,590
Sorry to hear that.

759
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,570
You doing okay?

760
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,930
Not really.

761
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,370
But I'm...working on it.

762
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,530
Okay.

763
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,990
Dr. Browne, good work.

764
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,060
Thank you.

765
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,970
I apologized to Zara.

766
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,980
She pointed out I spent med school...

767
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,600
trying to make white people comfortable.

768
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,850
I mean, she's right.

769
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,290
It wasn't just med school.

770
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,670
Exhausting, isn't it?

771
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,080
But we had to do it, right?

772
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,520
To be here?
