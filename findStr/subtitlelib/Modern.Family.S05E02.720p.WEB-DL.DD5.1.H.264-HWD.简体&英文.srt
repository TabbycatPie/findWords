1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,620
传统的"开学日"薄烤饼
Traditional "First day of school" Pancakes.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,720
-画个奶油笑脸不  -老爸  我都上高中了
- Whipped-cream smile? - Dad, I'm in high school now.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,250
直接挤进我嘴里就行
Just put it in my mouth.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,100
好了  太恶心了  快住手
Okay, that's disgusting. Stop it.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,610
快省省这发号施令的架势
Hey, save some of that bossing people around

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,040
留着去办公室使  女士
for the office, lady.

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,490
休假20年后
After a 20-year vacation,

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,290
克莱尔终于要重回职场了
Claire is rejoining the work force.

9
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:17,970
那可不是休假
Not a vacation.

10
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,050
但我要去我爸的橱柜公司开始新工作了
But I am starting a job at my dad's closet company.

11
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,850
他打算栽培我日后接手公司
He's kind of grooming me to take over.

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,260
我有市场营销方面的专业背景
I have a background in marketing.

13
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,650
我非常为她骄傲
I'm so proud of her.

14
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,240
说到市场  我们家的牛奶喝完了
Oh, uh, speaking of marketing -- we're out of milk.

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,610
我其实挺紧张的
I'm actually kind of nervous.

16
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,150
你一定会表现得很好的
You're gonna be great.

17
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,390
记住  一旦碰到麻烦
And remember, if you get into a jam,

18
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,350
就来一段我教你的模仿秀
just do the impression I taught you.

19
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,680
嘿  你可以把你的衣服挂在我身体里
Hey. You can hang your clothes in me.

20
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,410
克里斯托弗-步入式衣柜
Christopher walk-in closet.

21
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,100
我死也不会那么做
I'm not doing that.

22
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,710
放松点  老妈  你是给外公干活
Okay, relax, mom. You're working for grandpa.

23
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,710
都算不上真正意义上的工作
It's not even a real job.

24
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,400
就跟夏天时  我给老爸打工一样
It's like that summer when I worked for dad.

25
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,360
他只是试图在帮我树立信心
He was just trying to make me feel good about myself.

26
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,540
不是真的需要我帮忙
He didn't really need my help.

27
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,120
不是这样的
That's not true.

28
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,130
我确实需要你帮我分发宣传单
I needed your help distributing all those fliers.

29
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,850
我确实也分了  看我眼色
And I did. Wink, wink.

30
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,270
你怎么现在就在做作业了
How are you already doing homework?

31
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,760
我都高三了  得考好点才行
It's junior year. I have to get good grades.

32
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,110
你不知道现在外面竞争多激烈吗
Don't you know how competitive it is out there?

33
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,400
别再给我施加压力了
Stop pressuring me!

34
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,500
好端端的小孩变成这副鬼样子
You know, this is what happens to kids

35
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,990
完全是因为缺乏性活动
when they're not sexually active.

36
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,620
你不用去学习吗
Don't you have some studying to do?

37
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,970
拜托  我上的是社区大学
Please, it's community college.

38
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,950
他们只会让你带根固体胶去上学
They tell you to bring a glue stick.

39
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,930
你好
Hello.

40
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,300
没错  就是他  那位  我
Yes, this is he -- him -- me.

41
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,460
第一次就说对了
Right the first time.

42
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,510
我马上过去
I'll be right there.

43
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,550
米奇尔  就是这个
Mitchell, that was it.

44
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,990
等的就是这电话  我要过去了
That was the call. I'm going in.

45
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,870
由于预算削减  我的初中音乐教师岗位
Due to budget cuts, my position as middle-school music teacher

46
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,920
被撤销了
has been eliminated,

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,830
所以我一直在当高中替补教师
So I've been working as a high-school sub.

48
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,790
好耶
Ka-ching!

49
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,560
我从没想到还会收到"使命召唤"呢
I never know when I'll be summoned to swoop into action.

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,100
我有点像蝙蝠侠
I'm kind of like batman.

51
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,560
但我接到的不是蝙蝠求救图案  而是一通电话
But except for a bat-signal, I get a phone call.

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,500
是啊  你还是发现了点差异
Yeah, you found the one difference.

53
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,190
我也不想错过她的开学日
I hate to miss her first day,

54
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,020
但你能送莉莉去学校吗
but do you mind taking Lily to school?

55
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,850
小卡  今天吗
Oh, Cam, today?

56
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,430
我得准备跟查理的会面
I got to prep for my meeting with Charlie.

57
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,380
我跟他只有一小时会谈时间
I only get him for an hour

58
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,630
那还是趁着他在阿斯彭和卡波间的度假间隙
between his vacations in Aspen and Cabo.

59
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,940
你得去当面跟他对质
Okay, you need to confront him

60
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,890
告诉他  他那点无聊的中年危机
and tell him his pathetic little midlife crisis

61
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,600
会让你无法完成你的工作
is making it impossible for you to do your job.

62
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,690
因为他是个谦逊接受批评的人吗
Because he responds so well to criticism.

63
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,680
不  他会炒了我  然后我们就不得不在
No, he'll fire me, and then we'll end up

64
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,430
你家的谷仓里举行婚礼
having to get married in your family's barn.

65
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,750
我们得抓紧时间预定了
Oh, well, we need to book that soon

66
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,010
因为春天是方形舞季
because spring is hoedown season,

67
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,530
接着又是夏季的剧团下乡演出  所以...
And then you get right into summer stock, so...

68
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,140
我才不相信你说的
I don't believe any of that.

69
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,840
好了  如果要由我送莉莉  我得快点
All right, if I'm gonna take Lily, I need to hurry.

70
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,330
莉莉  甜心  快穿上衣服
Lily, sweetheart, let's get you dressed.

71
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,940
我衣服都穿好一小时了
Hey, I've been dressed for an hour.

72
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,780
快点  我可不能迟到  我会掉队的
Come on, I can't be late. I'll fall behind.

73
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,980
我有时总会忘记考虑她的亚洲人特性
Sometimes I forget to factor in the Asian.

伙计  我知道新学校会有点令人恐惧
Buddy, I know a new school can be scary,

88
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,020
所以给你点小建议
so a little advice --

89
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,370
你每碰到一个新朋友  就赞美对方几句
Every time you meet someone new, pay them a compliment.

90
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,130
比如  我喜欢你的头发
Like, um, "I love your hair."

91
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,240
腿法不错啊  你笑起来真美
"Awesome kicks." "You have a beautiful smile."

92
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,170
好了  老爸  我去跟那边那个大块头说
Okay, dad, I'll tell that big guy over there

93
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,610
他笑起来很美
that he's got a beautiful smile.

94
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,250
很好  皮肤啊  颧骨啊  随你怎么编
Fine. Skin, cheekbones, make it your own.

95
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,880
你能不能别一路跟着我进去
Um, could you maybe not walk me all the way in?

96
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,430
什么
What?

97
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,380
从这里开始我自己走就行
I've got it from here.

98

当然  好吧  跟你老爸抱
Sure. Yeah. Okay. Give your dad a --

99
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,790
去吧  艾丽克斯
Off you go. Alex!

100
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,830
曼尼  你为什么这么安静
Ay, Manny, why are you so quiet?

101
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,520
因为高中开学第一天而紧张吗
Are you nervous because of your first day in high school?

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,320
我已经脱胎换骨了
I'm a changed man.

104
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,890
天呐  你看到了什么
Oh, my God, what did you see?!

105
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,390
没什么  
Nothing,

106
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,440
但我现在是个乘过喷气飞机跨国旅行的阔少了
but I am an international jet-setter now.

107
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,370
我很高端大气上档次
I'm sophisticated.

108
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,930
你觉得姑娘们会因为这个而注意你吗
And you think that the girls are gonna pick up on this?

109
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,170
如果不行  我还有个"无人照顾的儿童"的标志
If not, I still have my "Unaccompanied minor" Sign.

110
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,600
我真不敢相信
Ay, I cannot believe

111
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,230
我的小宝贝都要上高中了
that my little baby's going to the high school.

112
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,210
老妈  快住手  你这是让我出丑呢
Mom, stop. You're embarrassing me.

113
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,770
今天也是我开学第一天  我可以跟你抱抱
It's my first day, too. I could use a hug.

114
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,870
滚出
Go!

115
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,940
-你好啊  歌洛莉亚  -好啊  菲尔
- Hey, Gloria. - Hi, Phil.

116
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,530
高中开学第一天啊
First day of high school, huh?

117
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,730
曼尼兴奋吗
Is Manny excited?

118
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,650
他今天早上5点就起床熨衣服了
Ay, he was up at 5:00 in the morning, ironing.

119
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,170
不过他郁闷的时候也这么做
Ay, but he does that, too, when he's depressed,

120
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,620
我也不知道是什么情况
so now I don't know.

121
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,960
卢克怎么样
How was Luke?

122
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,470
很好啊  他挺舍不得跟我告别的
Great. Yeah, he had a hard time saying goodbye.

123
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,980
但是不管怎样  我要买杯咖啡去
But, um, anyway, I think I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.

124
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,560
-我能跟你一起去吗  -行啊
- Can I go with you? - Yeah.

125
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,600
老兄  我正在对美女发动攻势呢
Dude, I'm kind of working something here.

126
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,790
要几辆卡车
How many trucks would that take?

127
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,240
等我一会儿  弗雷德
Give me a minute, Fred.

128
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,720
新来的姑娘来了
New girl just walked in.

129
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,060
你这话真恶心  那是我女儿
That's disgusting. She's my daughter.

130
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,410
亲爱的  你看起来美极了
Sweetheart, you look terrific.

131
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,110
真的吗
Are you sure?

132
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,360
因为我还带了领一件衬衫在...在这里
'cause I have another blouse in -- in here.

133
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,410
里面只有这一样东西  衬衫和一副眼镜
It's the only thing in here, that and a pair of glasses

134
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,510
以防我需要读点什么  看起来聪明一点
In case I need to read something or look smarter.

135
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,530
放松
Relax.

136
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,610
今天是你第一天工作
It's your first day.

137
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,500
不会搞砸的  那是什么
Impossible to blow it. What are those?

138
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,960
饼干  我给工作人员做的
Oh, cookies -- I made them for the office.

139
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,910
大错误  弗雷德  再给我点时间
Huge mistake. Fred, two more seconds.

140
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,690
我这里出了点状况  把饼干放下
I got a situation here. Put the cookies down.

141
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,410
-为什么  -你是管理层
- Why? - You're management.

142
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,780
那让你显得费尽心机
Makes you look desperate.

143
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,470
显得你很渴望让大家都喜欢你
Makes you look like you want everyone to like you.

144
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,590
我确实很想让大家都喜欢我
I do want everyone to like me.

145
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,970
你想让大家都尊重你
You want everyone to respect you.

146
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,680
你就得冷酷  树立距离感
You got to be tough. Keep your distance.

147
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,180
也许我们是不同类型的管理人
Well, maybe we are different kinds of managers.

148
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,690
是啊  但你归我管  把饼干留下吧
Yeah, I'm yours. Just leave the cookies.

149
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,170
瞧瞧你  我的一年级宝贝

151
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,960

152
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,740
我得走了  迫不及待要去学习了
Got to go! I can't wait to learn!

153
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,560
-小心点  -什么

154
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,060
没什么

156
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,100

157
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,310
-什么事  -你好  我是卡梅隆・塔克

我接到了电话  要我今天代课

好好干吧
So do a good job

162
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,000
这可能是个长期职位
'cause this could be a permanent position.

163
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,750
你就当自己是件结实的老牛仔背心吧
Well, prepare to feel like an old denim vest

164
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,940
因为我会亮瞎你的眼
because I'm about to "Be-dazzling" You.

165
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,530
我不知道那是什么意思  但好吧
I don't know what that means, but okay.

166
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,870
我教哪门课
So, what am I teaching?

167
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,280
高阶历史
A.P. History.

168
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,810
我十分想要那份工作
I desperately wanted that job.

169
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,890
但只有一个问题
There was just one problem --

170
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,260
我对历史知之甚少
I don't know much about history.

171
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,540
那你很了解生物吗
Do you know much biology?

172
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,120

世界将会多么美好*
*What a wonderful world this would be

177
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,270
我真的摊上麻烦了
I really was in a jam, though.

178
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,040
我爸觉得树立冷酷疏远的权威形象
My dad thinks that he can motivate his workers

179
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,020
能激发员工的积极性
by being a cold, distant authority figure.

180
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,910
如果他的方法那么有效  回答我这个问题
Well, if his style is so effective, riddle me this --

181
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,890
为什么我从来不听他的
why didn't I listen to him?

182

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,060
你们居然真在冷水器旁边谈天说地
You guys are actually hanging out by the water cooler.

187
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,860
我得了口干症  长期口腔干燥

我  很抱歉

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,770
是的  但我不希望你们拘泥于我这个身份
Um, yeah, but I don't want you to think of me like that.

194
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,090
我是你们的朋友  是同事
I'm -- I'm a friend. I'm a colleague.

195
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,050
我就和你们一样

二位  对不起  这里停业了  我们在拍广告
Oh, sorry, folks. It's closed. We're shooting a commercial.

205
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,010

我们只想喝杯咖啡

我看见了两位老人

211
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,340
这不是导尿管的广告吧
This isn't one of those catheter commercials, is it?

212
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,510
如果广告描述的太详细

我会浑身难受的
I'm gonna squirm.

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,300
好了  普里契特  我来了  你有半小时时间
Okay, Pritchett, I'm here. You got a half-hour.

251
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,610
我的直升飞机在楼顶上等着
I have my helicopter standing by on the roof.

252
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,730
楼顶上能停直升飞机吗
Is it even built for that?

253
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,560
不能  所以你只有半小时
No. That's why you only have a half-hour.

254
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,880
我不确定时间够不够
Well, I'm not sure that's gonna be enough time.

255
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,720
我们要说好多事呢
We have a ton to cover.

256
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,860
我们得谈谈新的租赁合同
We need to talk about new lease agreements

257
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,170
以及工人的薪资福利问题
and the workers' comp package.

258
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,860
只剩29分钟了  我好像听到了嘎吱声
29 minutes. I think I hear creaking.

259
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,810
爹地  我好无聊
Daddy, I'm bored.

260
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:08,920
我也是
Me, too.

261
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,020
所以我不该在假期之间来工作
This is why I shouldn't come into work between vacations.

262
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,180
你去坐在娜塔莉的桌子旁
Why don't you sit at Natalie's desk

263
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,170
假装是我的助理好吗  亲爱的
and pretend to be my assistant, sweetie?

264
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,220
抱歉  我侄女马上就来接走她
Sorry about that. My niece is coming to pick her up.

265
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,480
莉莉今天在学校出了场事故  她...
Lily had an incident at school today where she --

266
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,100
普里契特  
Hey, Pritchett,

267
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,500
你又不是我想勾引的单身辣妈
you're not some hot single mom i'm trying to seduce,

268
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,900
我没必要听你唠叨你家小孩
so I don't need to hear about your kid.

269
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,880
有道理  好吧  租赁合同
Fair enough. So, lease agreements.

270
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,140
迈阿密那处房产有些推迟
Okay, I'm getting some push-back on the Miami location.

271
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,280
普里契特先生  有位海莉小姐找你
Mr. Pritchett, I have a Haley here to see you.

272
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,180
好吧
Oh. Okay.

273
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,080
你好  亲爱的
Hi, sweetheart.

274
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,840
我在和我老板开会呢
I'm in the middle of a meeting with my boss,

275
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,660
万分感谢你来帮我
but thank you so much for helping me out.

276
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,410
没关系
No problem.

277
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,830
我上节课只给及格或不及格
My last class is a pass/fail.

278
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,250
那是社区大学  所以肯定会及格
And it's community college, so it's pass.

279
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,480
你好  我是查理・宾汉姆
Hi. Charlie Bingham.

280
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,040
瞧瞧你美丽的双眸
Look at your eyes.

281
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,610
我看不到
Oh. I-I can't.

282
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,520
我喜欢你
I like you.

283
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,980
你觉得我的裤子怎么样
What do you think of these pants?

284
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,300
是我们的新款之一
It's part of our new collection.

285
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,290
有好多拉链啊
It's, uh, a lot of zippers.

286
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,070
太多了  是吧
It's too many, right?

287
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,520
当我坐直升机时  拉链都戳进了我的大腿
And they poke into my thigh when I'm in my helicopter.

288
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,160
因为我有直升飞机  没什么大不了的
'Cause I have a helicopter. It's not a big deal.

289
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,470
总之  谢谢你
Okay, so, anyway, thank you.

290
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,180
你好像很了解时尚
You seem to know a lot about fashion.

291
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,040
关于几件衣服的款式  我想问问你的意见
I'd like to get your opinion on a few things.

292
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,080
-当然啦  -可以吗
- Sure. - Yeah?

293
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,800
-可以  -其实不行  她得留下来照看莉莉
- Yeah. - Actually, no, she -- she needs to stay and watch Lily.

294
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,090
你去照看吧
Yeah, you can do that.

295
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,470
你好啊  小公主
Hey, princess. Hey.

296
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,790
我超爱小孩子
I love kids.

297
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,800
爹地的办公室
Daddy's office.

298
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,350
你讲话才像小女孩呢
You sound like a little girl.

299
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,680
你想见我吗
Hey, you wanted to see me?

300
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,460
谢谢你"凑空"过来
Thanks for "Bzzzing" By.

301
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,170
我希望你"木有"在忙呢
I hope you weren't in the middle of a "Thang."

302
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,200
好吧  刚刚我确实有点失控
Okay, that did get a little away from me.

303
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,570
但说实话  我打破了坚冰
But to be fair, I broke the ice.

304
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,090
每个人都觉得你是个傻瓜
Everybody thinks you're a dummy.

305
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,800
不是每个人  不是的  实际上
Not everybody. No, as a matter of fact,

306
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,760
休息室有个人约我共进午餐呢
One of the guys in the break room asked me to lunch.

307
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,980
-他名叫陶德  -别说是陶德啊
- His name is Todd. - Don't say Todd.

308
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,570
不是吧
Oh, no.

309
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,410
你不能和陶德一起共进午餐
You cannot go to lunch with Todd.

310
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:43,960
为什么不行
Why not?

311
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,100
你不能和他有什么往来
You can't be associated with him.

312
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,260
直到一小时前  
Up until an hour ago,

313
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,520
他的"办公室怪胎"身份都无人动摇
he was the office weirdo.

314
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,650
但他对我很好啊
But he was nice to me,

315
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,850
他还帮我装电脑呢
And he helped me set up my computer.

316
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,290
是啊  那就是他的工作  暂时是的
Yeah, that's his job. For now.

317
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,120
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

318
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,190
我一找到新的IT人才就会炒了他
I'm firing him as soon as I can find an I.T. Guy

319
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,330
只要那个人能准时上班  
who shows up on time

320
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,270
而且不会让办公室其他人觉得讨厌
and doesn't creep out the office.

321
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,590
我不能取消跟他的约定  他是唯一对我好的人
I can't cancel on the one person who was nice to me.

322
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,390
你可以取消   但你不会取消的  
You can, but you won't,

323
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,260
因为你是那种会带饼干到办公室来的人
'cause you're the type of person who brings cookies to the office.

324
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,870
饼干哪儿去了
Where are they?

325
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,270
好了  没什么好说的了
Okay, we're done here.

326
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,040
好了  大伙儿  你们就装作随意交谈
Okay, folks, you're just having a normal conversation,

327
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,780
就像平常在咖啡店里那样  明白吗
a typical day in a coffee shop, all right?

328
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,940
明白
Roger that.

329
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,270
开始了哦  大家
Here we go, guys.

330
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,990
准备  开拍
And...action!

331
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,370
你最近怎么样  罗伊
How have you been, Roy?

332
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,270
心情有点低落
Ah, a little down.

333
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,200
海伦和我真的很想念孩子们
Helen and I really miss the kids,

334
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,790
但我们现在没钱去探望他们
But we just can't afford to visit them right now.

335
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,540
-你们考虑过反向抵押贷款吗  -那是什么
- Have you considered a reverse mortgage? - What's that?

336
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,840
-你的房子是有产权的对吧  -咖啡真好喝啊
- You have equity in your home, right? - This coffee is delicious!

337
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,460
后面的二位  我们听到你们的声音了
All right, you two in the back, we can hear you,

338
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,710
你们能像演哑剧一样用手势对话吗
So just mime your conversation.

339
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,990
哑剧  哑剧  我懂的
Mime -- mime -- I knew that.

340
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,600
我刚刚就是那样做的  跟着我做就行了
I was already doing that, so just follow my lead.

341
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,030
好的  抱歉  我们再来一次
Okay, sorry, sorry. We'll do it again.

342
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,320
但我们的其他表现都可以吗
But everything else is okay?

343
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,290
你们还没做其他什么事
You haven't done anything else.

344
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,990
-所以是说可以吗  -重新开始
- So, yeah? - Back to one, guys.

345
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,730
开拍
Action.

346
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,470
你最近怎么样  罗伊
How have you been, Roy?

347
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,150
心情有点低落
Ah, a little down.

348
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,710
海伦和我真的很想念孩子们
Helen and I really miss the kids,

349
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,040
但我们现在没钱去探望他们
But we just can't afford to visit them right now.

350
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,010
-你们考虑过反向抵押贷款吗  -那是什么
- Have you considered a reverse mortgage? - What's that?

351
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,890
你的房子是有产权的对吧
You have equity in your home, right?

352
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,110
-当然了  -他们在搞什么呢
- Sure, we do. - What are they doing?

353
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,780
她是在假装接电话吗
Is she answering an imaginary phone?

354
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,230
那简直好得令人难以置信啊
Oh, that sounds too good to be true.

355
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,510
你可以不用听我的
Don't take my word for it.

356
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,420
接下来亨利・维克纳会给你做更详细的介绍
Here's Henry Winkler to tell you more.

357
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,410
好了  停
Okay, cut.

358
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,150
后面的那一对
Couple in the back.

359
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,520
在  不  我懂了  再大点声吗
Yep. No, I know. I know. Bigger?

360
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,030
美国原著民和殖民者
The native Americans and the settlers

361
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,650
对土地所有权的观念完全不同
had two completely different ideas of land ownership.

362
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,080
最终  这些不同将引发战争
Eventually, these differences would lead to war.

363
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,310
快看  我都起鸡皮疙瘩了
Oh. Look, goose bumps.

364
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,210
好了  就到这儿吧  下课
Okay, yes. Uh, class dismissed.

365
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,620
我们做到了
We did it!

366
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,570
谢谢你半路拔刀相助  我保证
Thank you so much for stepping in. Oh, and I promise,

367
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,930
明天我一定课前做好充分准备
Tomorrow, I will do my best to be more prepared.

368
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,710
明天吗  哈利老师不是回来了吗
Tomorrow? Why won't Mrs. Hurley be back?

369
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,350
我也不想说出这么无礼的话
Well, I don't want to be indelicate,

370
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,180
但好消息是  我可能会成为你的专职老师
But the good news is, is I might be your permanent teacher.

371
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,600
-我不希望你成为我的专职老师  -怎么
- I don't want you to be my permanent teacher. - Oh, what?

372
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,070
你更希望一个大酒鬼来当你的老师吗
You'd rather have a raging alcoholic?

373
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:52,830
听好了
Listen to me.

374
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,270
我孜孜不倦地学习  才取得这么好的成绩
I've worked nonstop to build the perfect academic record,

375
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,070
我可不会让你给毁了
And I'm not going to let you screw it up now.

376
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,310
我160天后就要进行高阶考试了  
I have an A.P. Test in 160 days,

377
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,220
我必须名列前茅
and I need to ace it.

378
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,320
你能助我登上顶峰吗
Can you get me there or not?

379
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,870
我可以像阿拉摩的勇士一般重振旗鼓
I can rally like the brave men of the Alamo.

380
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,870
你知道阿拉摩的勇士全死光了吧
You do realize that all the men of the alamo died?

381
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,670
他们全死了
They all died!

382
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,250
露希年长一些  所以她觉得自己就是老大
Ruthie's older, so she thinks she's the boss.

383
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,960
但对于一个小家伙来说  斯顿自有一套
But for a little guy, Stu holds his own.

384
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,410
他们有时候挺难伺候的
They can be a handful.

385
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,760
但是  他们总让我笑得肚子疼
But, god, they make me laugh so hard, you know?

386
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,900
我不知道你连乌龟的性别都可以区分开呢
I did not know you could even tell the gender of a turtle.

387
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,530
那当然了
Oh, yeah.

388
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,810
那叫"乌龟辨雌雄"大法  总共有8步
It's called "Sexing the turtle," And it's an eight-step process.

389
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,790
现在我们假装你的手就是一只乌龟
Now, let's pretend your hand is a turtle.

390
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,070
-好的  -你要把它翻过身来
- Okay. - What you do is you flip it over.

391
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,900
然后你要仔细瞧瞧它的...
And then you have to look right into --

392
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,160
好吧  我懂了  我懂了  我想明白了
Oh, okay. I get it. I get it. I think I get it.

393
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,080
我懂的  我的说教太无聊了  对吧
Oh. I know. I'm droning on, aren't I?

394
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,420
停下  求你快停下
Please, stop. Please stop!

395
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,320
你没有啦  你没有啦
You're not. You're not.

396
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,440
我就是的  不过我的家庭情况介绍得够多了
I am. But enough about my family.

397
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,400
跟我说说你的家庭吧
Tell me about yours.

398
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,600
好啊  我丈夫菲尔是个房地产中介
All right, well, my husband Phil's a realtor.

399
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,440
真巧啊  我刚好想买房呢
That's funny. I'm buying a house.

400
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,820
为什么  什么时候
Why? When?

401
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,810
实际上  我们今天就要进行最后的看房
Actually, we have the final walk-through today,

402
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,080
明天就签合同了
Sign the papers tomorrow.

403
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,800
那  那可是件大事  陶德
Th-that's a really big deal, Todd.

404
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,010
是啊  而且对我们也挺艰难的
Yeah, and it's a bit of a stretch for us, too,

405
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,290
但是  不行  现在时机正好
But, uh, no, the time is right.

406
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,420
我们  我们一定要买
We're just -- we're gonna do it.

407
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,950
"我们"指的是你和乌龟们吗
"We" is you and the turtles?

408
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,090
不  是我和我妻子
No, me and my wife.

409
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,130
妻...我很抱歉
A w-- I'm sorry.

410
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,390
你没说你有妻子啊  那太棒了
You didn't mention your wife. That's great.

411
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,730
我猜她的工作一定高端又高薪吧
I bet she's got a big, fancy, high-paying job, right?

412
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,330
她正在攻读硕士学位
Uh, she's getting her master's.

413
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,940
-哪方面的  -拉丁文
- In? - Latin.

414
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,330
陶德呀
Oh, Todd.

415
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,500
现在或许不是买房的最佳时机
This may not be the best time to buy a house.

416
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,590
我也不想做坏人  来跟你说这些
I hate to be the one to break this to you --

417
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,910
不不不   我来买单
Oh. No, no, no, no, I got this.

418
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,830
不  不用了
No, you don't.

419
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,390
大家预备
Stand by, everyone.

420
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,800
我真觉得我上一条拍得特别好
I really felt like I nailed that last one.

421
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,550
我还是觉得很不入戏
I still feel so stiff.

422
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,680
我都不知道该假装说什么才好
I don't know what to pretend saying.

423
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,320
你想得太多了  就从你的现实生活出发就好
You're thinking too much. Just draw from your own life.

424
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,000
比如  你今天过得怎么样
Like, how was your day today?

425
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,260
糟透了  我的亲儿子不想跟我拥抱
Lousy. My own son didn't want to hug me.

426
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,880
好吧  就用上这种情绪
Okay, so use that.

427
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,790
我的角色  叫斯蒂芬・威尔逊医生
My character, Dr. Stephen Wilson,

428
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,870
也很伤心  因为他儿子不肯听他的建议
Is also sad because his son wouldn't take his advice

429
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,710
而且他想在距学校一个街区远的地方就下车
And he wanted to be dropped off a block away from school.

430
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,750
他能理解他的女儿们这么做
He expected that from his daughters

431
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,580
他以为他的儿子会不一样呢
But thought his son would be different.

432
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,210
那太可悲了
That's so sad.

433
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,030
但斯蒂芬医生是不会让这件事
But Dr. Stephen wilson is not going to let that

434
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,930
毁了他和情人的早餐时光
ruin breakfast with his mistress.

435
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,500
其实  或许我们现在是时候
You know, maybe it's just time for us to --

436
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,280
放开他们的手了
to accept that we have to let them go.

437
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,320
或许是吧
Maybe it is.

438
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,490
好了  大家  开始了  摄像机要开拍了
Okay, everyone, here we go. We're rolling.

439
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,230
开始
And action!

440
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,690
你最近怎么样  罗伊
How have you been, Roy?

441
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,050
心情有点低落
Ah, a little down.

442
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,600
海伦和我真的很想念孩子们
Helen and I really miss the kids,

443
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,170
但我们现在没钱去探望他们
But we just can't afford to visit them right now.

444
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,330
-你们考虑过反向抵押贷款吗  -那是什么
- Have you considered a reverse mortgage? - What's that?

445
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,340
你的房子是有产权的对吧
Uh, you have equity in your home, right?

446
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,310
-当然  -请你别哭
- Sure, we do. - Please, no crying.

447
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,970
你哭我也想哭了
You're gonna make me cry, too.

448
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,480
本质上来说就是银行买下了你的房子
Well, essentially the bank buys your house.

449
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,220
但你依然可以住在里面
But you still get to live in it.

450
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,220
那简直好得令人难以置信啊
That sounds too good to be true.

451
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,670
你可以不用听我的
Don't take my word for it.

452
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,130
接下来亨利・维克纳会给你做更详细的介绍
Here's Henry Winkler to tell us more.

453
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:58,320
[《欢乐时光》中方奇的扮演者]

454
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,090
我可不想让方奇看到我这个样子
I don't want the Fonz to see me like this.

455
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,400
这件是样品  可以抵挡住
It's a prototype. It can withstand

456
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,180
地球上最极端的温度
the most extreme temperatures on the planet.

457
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,910
防水面料  可以去除汗水  
It's waterproof, and it wicks sweat.

458
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,250
那也会令女人却步
It also repels women.

459
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,120
我知道  我讨厌这件  今晚我就烧掉
I know. I hate it. I'll burn it tonight!

460
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,080
事实上  这个烧不掉
Aah! Actually, it doesn't burn.

461
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,050
好啦  我们继续说租赁合同
Anyway, if we could get back to the lease agreements here.

462
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,050
你太厉害了  你觉得该怎么改
You're amazing. How would you fix it?

463
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,230
太宽松了
It's too boxy.

464
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,100
也许可以改成这样
Probably have to take it in here...

465
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,260
-没错  -还有这里
- Right. - ...and here.

466
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,310
我健身健得有些过了
Yeah, I probably overdo it in the gym.

467
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,590
该死的7%的身体脂肪
Stupid 7% body fat.

468
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,010
好吧  继续工作
Okay, so getting back to work.

469
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,760
我们在工作  为什么要工作
We are working. Why are we working?!

470
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,430
我得去卡波了  你想和我一起去吗
I got to go to Cabo. Hey, you want to come with me?

471
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,230
我从未去过卡波
Oh, I've, uh, never been to Cabo.

472
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,470
她不会去卡波  因为你老得能当她爹了
Yeah, she's not going to cabo 'cause she's half your age.

473
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,870
-你多大了  -谁在乎这个
- How old are you? - Who cares?

474
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,340
很快  我就会面如二十少年郎
Pretty soon, I'm gonna look 20.

475
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,780
我一直在密封蛋内冥想[类似太空舱]
I've been meditating in one of those pressurized eggs.

476
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,690
如果我去卡波
Well, if I went to cabo,

477
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,940
睡眠情况会是怎样的
what would the sleeping situation be?

478
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,660
没什么时间睡
Not much.

479
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,870
好了  够了  调戏到此为止  
Okay, no, that is enough! No! No!

480
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,190
她是我的外甥女
She is my niece!

481
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,130
明白吗
Okay?

482
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,920
你这种可悲的中年危机
This pathetic midlife crisis of yours

483
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,190
危害到了公司
is -- is hurting the company,

484
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,840
我已经厌倦了给你擦屁股
and I'm getting so sick of cleaning up your messes.

485
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,740
你需要集中精神  你的行为要与年龄相符
Y-you need to focus and you need to start acting your age --

486
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,300
你真正的年龄  而不是"蛋内"年龄
Your -- your real age, not your egg age.

487
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,570
通常来说  有人跟我这样说话   我会炒掉他
Normally, if someone talked to me that way, I'd fire him.

488
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,220
但我尊重你的诚实  尊重你的激情
But I respect your honesty. I respect your passion.

489
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,160
和我一样  我也是一个很有激情的男人
It's like me. I'm a very passionate man.

490
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,730
集中精神做正事
Just focus.

491
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,770
你说得对  你说得对
You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right.

492
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,750
那个嘎吱声是怎么回事
What's that creaking?

493
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,490
预备  开球
Hut! Hike!

494
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,240
你跑错方向了
Oh, hey, you're going the wrong way!

495
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,750
方向错了  不是
That's the wrong way! No!

496
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,470
等等  对不起  你是对的
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right.

497
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,330
打扰下  布朗校长
Uh, excuse me, principal Brown.

498
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,460
妈呀  大多数代课老师就在课上放部电影算了
Yikes. You know, most subs just play a movie.

499
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,290
好啦  来点不同的  同学们
All right, do something different, guys.

500
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,920
听我说  我不能做历史老师
Uh, listen, I-I can't be your history teacher.

501
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,270
那些孩子学习非常努力  他们值得拥有
Those kids work so hard, and they deserve someone

502
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,120
真才实学  并且可以激励他们的老师  所以
who knows the material and can inspire them, so...

503
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,500
随你吧
If you say so.

504
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,630
我想问下
Hey, I was wondering,

505
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,920
你这是在训练什么战术
what kind of play was that you were running?

506
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,120
是侧攻吗
Was that supposed to be a slant?

507
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,520
高一的教练辞职了
Our freshman coach quit.

508
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,320
我这是变相在做保姆
I'm just a glorified babysitter.

509
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,390
接球手需要学习跑位
Well, your receiver needs to learn to run his routes,

510
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,870
否则四分卫不可能把球传给他
or the quarterback's never gonna be able to hit him.

511
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,000
-我在大学时打过校队  -好的
- I-I played in college. - Oh. Okay.

512
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,130
泰勒  你需要学习跑位
Hey, Tyler, you need to learn to run your routes.

513
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,420
什么位
What routes?

514
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,000
对  什么位
Yeah, what routes?

515
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,510
在这里就位
Well, you're gonna line up here.

516
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,890
跑三步
Take three steps.

517
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,710
一二三  到这里
One, two, three -- plant right,

518
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,680
左45度跑向球场
Open left 45 degrees up the field.

519
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,110
不如再来一次
Okay, why don't we try it again?

520
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,340
再来一次  
Try it again! Tip!

521
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,070
投球时要用力  18号
Put some zip on the ball, 18!

522
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,850
预备  开球
Hut, hut, hike!

523
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,780
扔给他
Hit him!

524
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,930
有进步  做得好  再来一次  
Better. Better. Good job. Circle back up.

525
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,880
总之  感谢你给我这个机会
All right, anyway, thank you for the opportunity.

526
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,980
你想接管这支球队吗
Hey, hey, how would you like to take over this team?

527
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,400
这个提议真有趣
Well, well, that's an interesting offer.

528
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,770
-工资多少  -没有
- How much does it pay? - Nothing.

529
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,560
你确定吗
Are you firm on that?

530
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,680
确定  但现在有体育老师的空缺
Yeah, but there's a gym-teacher position available.

531
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,640
-你做教练这活儿就归你了  -我可以穿短裤吗
- It's all yours if you coach. - Can I wear shorts?

532
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,910
可以  还有口哨给你
Yeah, and you get a whistle, too.

533
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,880
我穿短裤时总是有人对我吹口哨
Oh, I always get a whistle when I wear shorts.

534
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,960
我谦卑地接受您给的这份工作
I humbly accept your offer.

535
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,570
集合  同学们  来吧  快点
Huddle up, boys! Let's go! Hustle!

536
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,770
你知道快点是什么意思吗  10号

539
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,050

玛格丽特  我为什么不能登录

告诉陶德你打算炒掉他

00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,430
他拥抱了我  谢了我

-校园里不要勾肩搭背  -好的

没人可以保证必然胜利
Success is not guaranteed.

胜利不是唾手可得的
It is not handed to you.

576
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,400
要争取才会有胜利
Success is earned.

今天  我们在开拓一条新的道路  同学们

唯一能让我们恐惧的  就是恐惧本身
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself!

585
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,550
[语出罗斯福总统  小卡扮的是华盛顿]

586
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,550
总统名言对应错位
Wrong president.

587
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,840

- Just keep pushing! - Okay.
