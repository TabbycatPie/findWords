20
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,270
Shaun --

21
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,680
You need to give me your driver's license.

22
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,660
No, I don't.

23
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,230
- Do you remember the memory test I gave you? - Vividly.

24
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,780
Yes. It demonstrated you have a deficit.

25
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,820
A deficit; you shouldn't be driving.

26
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,190
Dr. Blaize agreed.

27
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,330
Shaun, that test was supposed to be between us;

28
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,700
that's why I didn't want to do it at the hospital.

29
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,690
Yes, your doctor needs to be informed

30
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,110
of the results - of all your medical tests.

31
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,060
Even tests that are done at home.

32
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,940
Shaun, I've been driving for like half a century.

33
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,890
I'm an excellent driver, okay?

34
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,010
I don't need to give you my driver's license.

35
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,200
Okay. Then I'll have to notify the DMV.

36
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,960
Dr. Glassman?

37
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,490
You're not gonna notify the DMV, Shaun.

38
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,810
Yes, I will notify the DMV.

39
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,180
Shaun, you will not notify the DMV.

40
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,520
Dr. Glassman,

41
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,680
if you don't give me your driver's license,

42
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,090
I will notify the DMV.

43
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,890
Dr. Glassman?

44
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,510
George Reynolds, 28,

45
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,280
sudden onset of arm and leg weakness,

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,150
right facial droop, and trouble speaking.

47
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,940
CT confirmed a middle cerebral artery embolism.

48
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,930
I booked us into interventional radiology.

49
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,740
When did you first notice your symptoms, George?

50
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,930
About, uh, four and a half hours ago.

51
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,100
Wait, what's wrong with me?

52
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,510
You may be having a stroke.

53
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,740
You're on monthly injections of Lupron?

54
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,870
For three months.

55
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,930
That may have caused this.

56
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,290
Do you have prostate cancer?

57
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,020
No. I-I was diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia.

58
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,780
That shouldn't have any effect on what we're gonna do now.

59
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,890
We're gonna take care of you, George.

60
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,790
Don't worry.

61
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,790
This is local anesthetic;

62
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,060
you'll feel a pinch.

63
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,080
Are you a real doctor?

64
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,830
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

65
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,660
People ever call you Murph?

66
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,590
No.

67
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,100
I'm going to make a small incision

68
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,330
so we can insert the tube and re-inflate your lung.

69
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,000
What do they call you, Billy?

70
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,080
CraterHead, Volcano, ThreeEyes...

71
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,980
those are just the creative ones.

72
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,690
Hold tight.

73
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,910
Here comes the tube...

74
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,360
You guys really know what you're doing.

75
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,280
Yes, we do.

76
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,840
We'll order an MRI for your lungs.

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,770
Then we will fix your fractured eye orbit;

78
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,730
that will require surgery.

79
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,350
What do you say we fix your forehead, too?

80
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,580
You could do that?

81
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,350
- I think so -- - I don't think so.

82
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,740
It's a pre-existing condition,

83
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,030
and it's not medically necessary.

84
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,470
It shouldn't be approved.

85
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,580
The MCA clot is obstructing all distal flow.

86
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,390
Anti-androgens aren't indicated for hyperplasia...

87
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,870
He said atypical.

88
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,090
You think he's lying?

89
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,990
Maybe he's gender transitioning.

90
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,130
Aside from cancer, there aren't many other indications.

91
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,550
Let's focus on what we do know.

92
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,150
Feeding the catheter.

93
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,120
Suctioning the thrombus,

94
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,950
and he's recanalizing. Slowly retract.

95
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,750
Whatever his reasons are for taking anti-androgens,

96
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,030
hopefully there are options.

97
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,620
He either drops them or he's gonna keep having strokes.

98
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,670
The forehead repair would be expensive and cosmetic --

99
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,340
It's not about prettying him up;

100
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,680
it could give him a new life, friends,

101
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,010
maybe a few less beatings.

102
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,730
Stopping the beatings is the guards' job.

103
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,900
You really don't have any empathy for Billy?

104
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,980
Empathy is a bad reason to fight for someone.

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,640
If empathy makes me only want to help patients

106
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,030
who are from Wyoming or have ASD,

107
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,340
then that's very unfair to all my neuro-typical patients from Idaho.

108
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,120
I need to take those drugs.

109
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,860
They caused your stroke.

110
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,200
We don't think you have hyperplasia.

111
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,420
If you tell us the real reason,

112
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,420
I'm sure there are other safer treatments --

113
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,550
No, there aren't!

114
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,660
If you're transitioning, there are alternatives --

115
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,480
I told you why I was taking the meds.

116
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,500
George, we are your doctors;

117
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,510
we need to know the truth.

118
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,250
We're not gonna tell anyone.

119
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,350
I'm not transitioning.

120
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,600
And I don't have hyperplasia.

121
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,100
I have problems...

122
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,250
with my sex drive.

123
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,260
I know it sounds stupid,

124
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,720
like why can't I just control myself

125
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,500
but...

126
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,860
It's all I think about.

127
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,550
It's all I can think about.

128
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,220
I can't work,

129
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,900
I can't socialize,

130
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,810
I can't have a life.

131
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,710
And those meds are the only thing

132
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,440
that makes it even remotely tolerable.

133
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,930
They'll kill you.

134
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,570
The residents have a betting pool

135
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,220
on who you're going to appoint.

136
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,260
As your replacement as Chief of Surgery,

137
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,660
the decision needs to be made with decorum and expediency.

138
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,120
I haven't quite gotten around to analyzing --

139
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,220
You've had little face time with your attendings

140
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,630
since you became president.

141
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,090
You need to correct that.

142
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,640
I've scheduled your announcement.

143
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,570
You've got two days.

144
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,110
- Where is he? - He's gone;

145
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,320
signed out AMA.

146
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,850
- I tried -- - How long ago?

147
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,260
Five minutes...

148
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,130
Why are we in a hurry?

149
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,010
I was researching alternative meds for him.

150
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,730
Realized Lupron didn't make any sense.

151
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,060
Prescribing anti-androgens for sexual urges

152
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,690
is like hitting a mosquito with a mallet.

153
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,490
Unless they're deviant urges.

154
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,050
We might've just released a child molester.

155
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,120
Should we call the police?

156
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,080
We can't.

157
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,130
We have no evidence of a crime.

158
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,430
Lim's at 3 to 2,

159
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,450
Melendez is just behind at 2 to 1,

160
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,520
Cooperberg's 7 to 1,

161
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,590
and if Dartling, or anybody else comes in,

162
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,850
you can retire.

163
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,480
Andrews might bail on Melendez

164
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,280
when he finds out our patient bolted.

165
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,230
Which is why Melendez is now 4 to 1.

166
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,150
Pari-mutuel betting is very exciting.

167
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,630
Do you need empathy to be a good doctor?

168
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,570
No. I think it can interfere

169
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,350
with effective decision-making.

170
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,940
She's just saying that to avoid hurting your feelings,

171
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,160
thus making her fake point for real --

172
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,220
her empathy made her lie to you.

173
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,510
I think you just agreed with me and insulted me at the same time.

174
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,410
I think empathy's very important...

175
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,560
Telling the cold hard truth even when it hurts,

176
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,970
sometimes is the most empathetic thing we can do.

177
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,990
Which is what I'm doing for Shaun right now.

178
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,060
You're welcome.

179
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,390
I have autism

180
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,000
which means I have a deficiency of mirror neurons,

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,810
which inhibits me from emotionally trading places with people, 

182
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,430
which makes empathy very difficult.

183
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,800
Does that mean I can't be a good doctor?

184
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,810
No, it doesn't.

185
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,480
We all have our strengths and weaknesses, Shaun.

186
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,760
One of Claire's is making sure everyone feels validated.

187
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,870
The creep is back.

188
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,130
Is George having another stroke?

189
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,140
No.

190
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,040
Severe lacerations to the scrotum.

191
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,510
Did you give him anything for pain?

192
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,350
Morphine. Four milligrams. And I notified the cops;

193
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,640
I think it was a hate crime.

194
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah, I don't think so.

195
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,230
All right.

196
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,340
On my count.

197
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,960
One, two, three.

198
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,370
We'll take it from here.

199
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,810
I'll pack him and prep him.

200
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,220
You did this to yourself, didn't you?

201
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,540
I think I know what kind of urges you've been having.

202
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm not a monster.

203
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,910
I never touched anyone...

204
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,120
any...child.

205
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,250
My sister and I were always best friends...

206
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,810
but then she had children.

207
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,890
If I can't keep taking the drugs...

208
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,080
I had to do this.

209
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,480
Home surgery tends to not have the results you're hoping for.

210
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,730
You did a lot of damage

211
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,630
but your testicles are unscathed.

212
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,960
Please...finish the job.

213
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,000
I say we do it; he's a pedophile.

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,810
No, he's not.

215
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,100
He just told us he was.

216
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,700
He has never acted on his urges,

217
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,100
and he's asking us to do something

218
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,520
to ensure he never does.

219
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,190
He is a decent person trying --

220
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,350
I'm confused.

221
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,630
What do you want to do with him?

222
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,940
Treat him like a patient with a diagnosis.

223
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,360
Put him on antidepressants,

224
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,770
refer him to a urologist, give him a psych eval.

225
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,480
Let the experts determine if he should have a castration.

226
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,650
Psych eval? Antidepressants?

227
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,270
When we refer people for counseling,

228
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,690
how often do they get cured?

229
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,000
I am looking to help him manage this dis--

230
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
And if they don't get cured, what happens?

231
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,910
They get more depressed, can't cope, quit jobs,

232
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,220
maybe kill themselves?

233
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,800
All bad, but not...rape-a-child bad.

234
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,140
So what are you going to do?

235
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,150
We can't ethically remove healthy organs

236
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,420
for crime prevention.

237
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,510
We don't amputate a kleptomaniac's hands

238
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,110
to prevent them from stealing.

239
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,820
Hands have many purposes;

240
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,080
the balls of a pedophile have but one.

241
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,880
Set up his referrals and patch him up.

242
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,210
How long you been in Foothills?

243
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,490
Nine months...

244
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,670
Time flies in Juvie.

245
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,870
Any visitors?

246
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
I don't have a granny bringing me cookies,

247
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,910
if that's what you mean.

248
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,350
This is why empathy is bad.

249
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,980
You're talking to our patient because you like him,

250
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,370
which is causing him to move,

251
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,200
which is affecting our imagery.

252
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,690
He's scared.

253
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm talking to him to calm him down

254
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,680
which is improving our imagery.

255
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,090
The fact that I like him is beside the point.

256
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,080
You grow up in San Jose?

257
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,650
East Paly...but I got out of there as soon as I could...

258
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,150
I was 15.

259
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,530
Your parents still there?

260
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,200
Mom's gone...

261
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,390
Dear old Dad is...terrible.

262
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,660
Siblings?

263
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,960
Little brother...

264
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,540
He's gone too...

265
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,130
Crappy dad. Lost his brother...

266
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,720
I mean, you really don't ha--

267
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,190
He's not scared.

268
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,810
He's short of breath

269
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,820
because his diaphragm is lacerated.

270
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,190
His stomach has passed through that tear

271
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,420
and is now in his chest.

272
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,120
Billy needs emergency surgery on his diaphragm.

273
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,880
The defect reaches all the way

274
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,430
from the center to the anterior costal margin.

275
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,160
So what do we need to do?

276
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,890
Divide the inferior pulmonary ligament

277
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,270
to bring the lung upwards.

278
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,410
Mesh.

279
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,060
Whoever kicked him was wearing some serious footwear.

280
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,990
And they'll be waiting for him when he goes back.

281
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,220
Unless we help him.

282
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,750
Dr. Park wants to fix his forehead.

283
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,280
The Constitution guarantees prisoners

284
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,910
get the same care as everyone else.

285
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,370
Most non-prisoners can't afford cosmetic surgery.

286
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,640
He would be getting better care than everyone else.

287
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,310
Kid is smart and personable and puts up a great front.

288
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,730
But he's scared to death.

289
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,700
And he got 36 months for selling weed;

290
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,420
a crime that doesn't even exist anymore.

291
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,100
You think his life would be anything like this

292
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,210
if he didn't grow up with a massive dent in his head?

293
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,970
Sorry, I'm not convinced.

294
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,940
Is that because you don't have any empathy for Billy?

295
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,210
No. It's because I agree with you:

296
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,460
it's expensive, risky and unnecessary.

297
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,150
But empathy can be an invaluable motivator, Dr. Murphy, 

298
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,980
that truly connects the physician with their patient.

299
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,970
Is he still up there?

300
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,530
Yes he is.

301
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,650
We can't do the castration, George.

302
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,990
Not without the proper psychiatric clearance.

303
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,610
That'll take forever.

304
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,930
Just a few months.

305
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,730
A few months is forever.

306
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,720
Binge watch your favorite shows, catch up on your reading.

307
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,830
You attracted to men, Dr. Reznick?

308
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,770
Yes. Adult men.

309
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,160
And if that were...reprehensible,

310
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,890
do you think you could stop?

311
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,850
You have no idea what it's like

312
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,210
to live with these thoughts.

313
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,300
I hate them,

314
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,940
and I hate myself for having them.

315
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,330
But I can't stop them...

316
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,530
and I'm afraid of what I could do.

317
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,320
We will start the process immediately.

318
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,300
In the meantime, we'll transfuse you,

319
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,740
get you on antibiotics --

320
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,410
No. I'm refusing treatment.

321
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,490
No transfusion. No antibiotics. No repair.

322
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,080
Let 'em rot.

323
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,840
We have something in common.

324
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,520
Neither of us has a driver's license.

325
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,850
How do you feel about not having a driver's license?

326
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,930
I'm pissed, Shaun.

327
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,110
You feel pissed.

328
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,140
Yes, I feel pissed. I feel very pissed

329
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,740
because something important was taken away from me.

330
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,080
And by a friend.

331
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,320
You feel very pissed

332
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,100
because something important was taken away from you...

333
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
and by a friend.

334
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,440
And parroting everything I say isn't helping.

335
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,860
I'm finding commonality, Dr. Glassman,

336
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,380
and inquiring about your emotional state,

337
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,400
and actively listening by restating your responses.

338
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,550
"External corroboration enhances our sense of self-worth."

339
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,040
Okay.

340
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,850
The day after I got my driver's license,

341
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,230
you want to know what I did?

342
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,580
I went out and bought a 1963 Galaxie, Midnight Blue.

343
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,260
1,255 bucks,

344
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,470
every penny I earned for the past three years

345
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,080
working in a gas station.

346
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,740
How do you think that made me feel?

347
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,860
You liked it?

348
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,110
No, Shaun. I loved it.

349
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,110
You want to know why?

350
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,620
Because a car to a sixteen-year-old kid

351
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,640
means independence,

352
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,510
which means he can go wherever he wants

353
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,020
whenever he wants.

354
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,650
And that doesn't change with age, Shaun,

355
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,560
in fact, it means even more.

356
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,010
When you took my license, that's what you took from me.

357
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,310
I don't expect you to understand.

358
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,610
So you don't have to pretend.

359
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,440
Is Andrews stalking you?

360
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,780
It's annoying.

361
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,900
We need to stand together and tell him to back off.

362
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,820
I'm not telling the president he's annoying.

363
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,660
He's infringing on our autonomy

364
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,470
and inhibiting the free flow of ideas,

365
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,040
both of which affect our ability

366
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,920
to deliver the best patient care.

367
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,590
That sounds slightly better.

368
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,740
Okay. I'm in.

369
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,080
- Are you? - No. Of course not.

370
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,190
The last thing I'm gonna do right now is confront him,

371
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,220
I'm the front-runner.

372
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,380
Not according to Vegas,

373
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,600
I'm three to two.

374
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,020
Guess they don't know that you have double my mortality rate.

375
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,570
I'm a trauma surgeon,

376
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,430
you're comparing apples to asshats.

377
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,660
I resent being called an apple.

378
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,930
The diaphragm repair went very well.

379
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,340
And we've scheduled your orbital fracture repair.

380
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,780
We'll get you some stronger pain meds for the recovery.

381
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,240
When are you gonna fix my forehead,

382
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,860
make me all John Legend?

383
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
I tried, Billy.

384
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,300
I'm sorry.

385
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,670
I wasn't really getting my hopes up anyway.

386
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,000
My dad taught me that.

387
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,250
He'd say, "You know what, Billy?"

388
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,340
And he'd just punch me in the face.

389
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,410
At least, I think that was the lesson he was trying to impart.

390
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,100
That's what happened to your forehead?

391
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,980
He was a big A's fan.

392
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,460
Watched every game with a bat in his hand.

393
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,740
August 14th, 2008,

394
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,510
they lost in the 12th inning...

395
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,110
Infection's setting in but his testicles

396
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,890
still show good flow on the Doppler.

397
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,550
- Pain meds? - He won't take them.

398
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,630
Thinks they'll knock him out

399
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,000
and we'll step in and repair them.

400
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,550
I hate this.

401
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,230
Me too.

402
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,870
I'm going to be a good driver.

403
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,730
I got every answer correct on the written test.

404
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,600
Except one

405
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,050
but that was because it was improperly worded.

406
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,050
I told the DMV they need to rewrite it

407
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,540
and they said they'd take it under advisement.

408
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,730
Great.

409
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,390
Let's go.

410
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,800
Okay... let's close our eyes...

411
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,140
and take some nice, deep breaths...

412
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,260
And how about a little guided imagery,

413
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,300
to evoke positive visualizations?

414
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,480
Okay.

415
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,220
Let's picture the parking lot...

416
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,500
the cars around us...

417
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,910
the yellow steel thingy at the entrance of the parking lot

418
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,190
that could really do a lot of damage...

419
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,320
A bollard.

420
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:31,540
The speed bump that is 15 feet from the corner

421
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,570
with the stop sign that someone put a "Hate" sticker on

422
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,710
so it says "Stop Hate,"

423
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,640
which is right in front of the Jiff-E Mart,

424
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,420
which says it's open "8 til Late, 24/7,"

425
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,600
which can't be true beca--

426
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,820
That's great, Shaun.

427
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,730
Super amount of visualization.

428
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,630
And now that we're feeling comfortable about our surroundings,

429
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,880
we can put the car into drive,

430
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,980
ease our foot off the brake...

431
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,180
Very nice...

432
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,900
We can open our eyes now, Shaun.

433
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,870
What we're doing is cruel.

434
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,150
I'm open to all options, Dr. Browne.

435
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,050
I'm gonna have to ask you to give us some privacy.

436
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:16,910
Really?

437
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,060
You want to throw the president of the hospital

438
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,670
out of a medical discussion?

439
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,730
You're infringing on my autonomy

440
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,770
and inhibiting the free flow of ideas,

441
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,800
both of which affect my ability to deliver the best patient care.

442
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,980
Dr. Melendez.

443
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,910
There are many drivers not following the rules of the road.

444
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,490
They fail to signal, check their blind spots...

445
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,600
display a red flag when the load extends

446
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,270
more than four feet past the tail lamp.

447
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,390
You're right, Shaun, it's a mad world.

448
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,060
But there's nothing you can do about them,

449
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,520
you just got to focus on you.

450
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,440
Yes, let's focus on me.

451
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,340
Yes.

452
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,930
Let's take the next right.

453
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,990
You can drive in the bike lane

454
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,780
when you're this close to the turn, Shaun.

455
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,150
No, I can't.

456
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,620
It's a broken line.

457
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,120
That was the improperly worded question --

458
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,920
whether it's broken or solid,

459
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,670
you can't enter the bike lane

460
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,880
this distance from the intersection.

461
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,320
I told them that it --

462
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,660
Okay, Shaun. You don't have to go so slow.

463
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,680
She's in the lane,

464
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,600
she's not supposed to be in the lane.

465
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,800
It's a violation carrying a fine --

466
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,050
- Okay, Shaun, don't worry about what she's doing -- - No.

467
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,030
Shaun, you have to pull into the bike lane --

468
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,720
Don't worry about what she's doing --

469
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,360
You can't just stop.

470
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,770
Shaun, you can't just stop...

471
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,980
Shaun!

472
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,120
George is screaming in agony and we are doing nothing.

473
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,400
Except hiding behind ethical red tape.

474
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,840
Ethical red tape is there to protect people like him

475
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,160
from making permanent regrettable mistakes.

476
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,800
I'm glad we're not using it to cover our asses

477
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,080
the day before the new Chief of Surgery is announced.

478
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,040
Let me sign off on the documentation.

479
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,060
I'll note his scrotum is already beyond repair

480
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,050
and surgical castration is our only option.

481
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,030
- I vote yes. - No.

482
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,700
I'm not gonna let anyone falsify medical records.

483
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,100
Not for pain. Not for a pedophile.

484
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,850
Once his testes are actually beyond repair,

485
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,230
we will castrate him.

486
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,960
So we're just gonna leave him there screaming;

487
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,770
keeping his entire unit awake?

488
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,730
Move him.

489
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,390
I'd like a clean dissection through the periosteal planes

490
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,250
so I can slip the MEDPOR mesh over the fracture.

491
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,350
Why do I prefer MEDPOR mesh?

492
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,600
It allows fibrovascular ingrowth

493
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,880
and integration - of the patient's tissue.

494
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,300
Prisoner surgeries are approved for psychological reasons all the time.

495
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,570
Tattoo removal,

496
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,950
gender reassignments include breast implants;

497
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,240
hell if he had a crappy smile

498
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,740
we could justify dental work as needed

499
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,230
for proper mastication...

500
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,310
You sent a few kids to Juvie?

501
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,070
More than a few.

502
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,030
You feel guilty.

503
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,150
Think that's maybe clouding your judgment?

504
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,410
Maybe.

505
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,760
You're afraid of ruffling Andrews' feathers

506
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,100
this close to decision day.

507
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,790
Think that's maybe clouding yours?

508
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,540
We could give Billy a breast implant.

509
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,400
We could insert it

510
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,320
over his split thickness frontal bone defect;

511
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,490
it would only require a tiny incision at his eyebrow.

512
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,160
Now you're in favor of this?

513
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,780
I was against it - because it was too expensive

514
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,700
and unnecessary and risky

515
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,330
but if we do it now,

516
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,580
it won't require any additional surgery.

517
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,750
And it'd be very economical.

518
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,570
He did give us verbal consent when he was first admitted.

519
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,740
Keep him under.

520
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,870
Get what we need, Dr. Murphy.

521
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,550
Ready or not...

522
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,350
Tell Melendez to meet us in the O.R.

523
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,980
Showing signs of ischemia;

524
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,520
we have a strong medical case for removing.

525
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,080
Dr. Lim. You a castration fan?

526
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,190
Right now, I am.

527
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,820
- Andrews told me he's backing off. - Great.

528
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,170
Because you presented him with a very good argument.

529
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,380
- My argument. - Which you regurgitated to him

530
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,450
right after you said you wouldn't back me up.

531
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,590
Call that leadership?

532
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,970
Yes I do.

533
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,930
You presented me with a very good argument

534
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,210
but you didn't have the guts to take it to Andrews on your own.

535
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,600
One more reason I don't want to work under you.

536
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,650
You don't want this promotion so that you can improve the hospital,

537
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,940
you want it for the pretty title.

538
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,190
You're an adrenaline junky;

539
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,640
you won't last 2 weeks liaising with board members.

540
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,320
There's a long and dusty trail

541
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,720
littered with people who have underestimated me.

542
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,440
We're ready to go.

543
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,020
Curved tissue scissors, please.

544
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,990
His systolic is 68. And look at this.

545
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,720
He's septic.

546
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,090
He's going into D.I.C.

547
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,200
Rerun his labs,

548
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,510
have platelets, plasma and cryo ready.

549
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,870
If he starts bleeding, he'll die.

550
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,260
I reduced the volume from 80 cc's to 35.

551
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,450
Have the odds changed in the last 24 hours?

552
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,000
- Little. - Where am I at?

553
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,110
Six to one.

554
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,530
I'll put 100 on me.

555
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,550
He's becoming severely bradycardic.

556
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:31,590
The pressure on his orbit caused a retrobulbar hematoma.

557
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,800
If we don't relieve it now, he'll arrest.

558
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,960
Forceps and scissors.

559
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,680
Just lost his pulse; pushing atropine.

560
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,890
Set up a temporary transcutaneous pacemaker.

561
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,640
If we inject the orbital muscle with local anesthetic

562
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,400
we might be able to fatigue the reflex.

563
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,050
Do it.

564
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,680
Starting CPR.

565
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,560
I hope - that's a look of resolve.

566
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,310
Melendez stood up to me in front of his residents.

567
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,630
I did the same thing to

568
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,320
O'Connell when I was his age.

569
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,320
What about Lim?

570
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,450
She has the kind of focus that took me years to develop.

571
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,660
And Cooperberg,

572
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,010
he reminds me of me when I was --

573
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,160
Marcus. You were good.

574
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,250
But no one's gonna be as good as you think you were.

575
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,040
One of your weaknesses was decision-making.

576
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,170
I trust you've gotten past that since I made you president.

577
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,950
Continuing compressions

578
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,060
until I have capture on the pacemaker.

579
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,020
Pacing pads are in position.

580
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,060
Stopping CPR.

581
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,320
Injecting lidocaine.

582
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,570
I have set the rate to 80.

583
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,950
Increase the ventricular by two milliamps.

584
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,750
Increase by two more.

585
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,640
Blood pressure is responding, 102/68.

586
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,200
Keep those pacer settings

587
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,850
and let's get back to the main event.

588
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,670
Both his PT and PTT

589
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,060
are coming back down,

590
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,530
his systolic is stable at 110, and no ectopy on the monitor.

591
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,920
His D.I.C. Score is back under four.

592
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,070
He's stabilized.

593
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,490
Ball's in your court.

594
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,290
Dr. Melendez?

595
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,670
Effects of low testosterone on cardiovascular function and sepsis?

596
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,130
Possible acute vascular response,

597
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,980
circulatory collapse --

598
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,520
And what about on D.I.C.?

599
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,430
Increased risk of clots and stroke.

600
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,560
George's body can't tolerate any loss of testosterone right now.

601
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,280
We want to save his life,

602
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,190
we have to save his testicles.

603
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,480
Sutures.

604
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,660
I know how to get you to drive.

605
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,340
I can't drive.

606
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,790
Driving is just like surgery.

607
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,890
Say you're driving down the street

608
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,520
and suddenly, - somebody steps off the sidewalk,

609
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,790
right in front of you.

610
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,940
Things like that must happen

611
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,480
when you're deep inside someone's belly.

612
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,690
That doesn't make any sense.

613
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,940
It's an analogy, Shaun.

614
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,050
I need you to work with me just a little bit.

615
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,930
Give me.

616
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,520
Okay.

617
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,320
It would be something unexpected,

618
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,490
out of our control,

619
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,110
from an aberrant source, and very bad.

620
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,330
It would be analogous to an arterial bleed.

621
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:02,460
How about if a truck stalls out, crippling traffic?

622
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,430
A thrombus impeding blood flow, so we divert.

623
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,250
A thrombus, exactly.

624
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,190
What if you're just cruising along

625
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,110
and a car comes out of nowhere and goes racing by?

626
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,940
A tachyarrhythmia.

627
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,860
- Yes! Shaun, you got this. - Yes.

628
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,020
So let's get you driving that hooptie.

629
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,900
I've got this, Albert.

630
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,790
We did the surgery;

631
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,600
your circulatory and clotting systems

632
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,870
were shutting down.

633
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,100
But removing your testicles would have put you

634
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,640
at greater risk by reducing your --

635
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,960
You would have died.

636
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,720
I've set you up with a psychiatrist and a urologist.

637
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,950
They'll screen you, get you cleared,

638
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,310
and then we can do this the right way.

639
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,400
George, we can get this done.

640
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,400
You just cannot try this again.

641
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,070
I get it.

642
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,030
I do it your way, - or it just doesn't happen.

643
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,990
It's just another intersection, Shaun,

644
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,490
just like the last one and just like the next one...

645
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,580
The last intersection isn't where everyone honked at me

646
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,810
and made me freeze --

647
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,250
That was a different day, with different drivers

648
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,250
and a different Shaun behind the wheel,

649
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,880
because today, this Shaun has a plan

650
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,700
for this intersection, which is...

651
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,030
...I am going to dissect it.

652
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,490
Damn right you are.

653
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,760
And today, you're gonna turn right

654
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,930
which you will do by...

655
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,640
Determining laterality.

656
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,040
And waiting until I can legally enter the bike lane.

657
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,600
Somebody just made a turn...

658
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,400
Shaun!

659
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,120
Everybody okay?

660
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,450
You were wrong.

661
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,930
You were wrong, Lea.

662
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,540
I can't drive.

663
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,440
- Shaun, I thought I had it figured out. - I can't drive.

664
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,210
I --

665
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,730
Surgery is mechanical.

666
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,310
Mechanics are predictable.

667
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,610
Driving is subject to human foibles

668
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,740
which means there are limitless possibilities.

669
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,950
You're right. My metaphor sucked.

670
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,140
It sucked very much.

671
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,930
Because...

672
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:14,650
becoming a surgeon is about way more than operating.

673
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,710
You had to learn about interacting

674
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:22,670
with teachers, co-workers, patients, bosses.

675
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,050
Cooperating with them, communicating with them --

676
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,290
I am very bad at communicating.

677
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,250
Shaun, you became a surgeon;

678
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:34,290
one of the hardest things that anyone can do.

679
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,060
And you proved that just because something is hard,

680
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,760
doesn't mean you can't do it.

681
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,920
And look what you just did.

682
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,940
I just hit a trash can.

683
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,610
Exactly; a trash can instead of an oncoming car

684
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,930
or a pedestrian.

685
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,270
You did great, Shaun.

686
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:01,280
That soccer ball was a dropped Metzenbaum.

687
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,110
I know, right?

688
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,500
When I accidentally drop an instrument in the O.R.,

689
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,710
I react quickly to minimize damage.

690
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,460
- Yes. - Yes.

691
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,470
I dropped a Metzenbaum.

692
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,430
I can drive this hooptie.

693
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,230
Window's about to close.

694
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:41,360
$10 will get you $1,000 if you want to bet on me.

695
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,610
Hey, everybody.

696
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,760
I can't be prouder of all of you.

697
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,090
We have grown into a preeminent surgical department,

698
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,100
which has been recognized with the official designation

699
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,540
of Surgical Center of Excellence.

700
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,600
It's now more important than ever

701
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,150
that we maintain our high standards.

702
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,590
And so, while there are many worthy candidates,

703
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,430
I've decided...

704
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,350
to retain the title myself.

705
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,180
Thank you.

706
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,270
Thank you!

707
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,940
Yes!

708
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,000
Y--

709
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,670
You...

710
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,460
You did it. You --

711
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,010
You really did it.

712
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,640
It was his idea.

713
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,350
Murph? You --

714
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,660
We inserted a small breast implant

715
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,870
to fill in the depression

716
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,650
and create a more aesthetically pleasing contour.

717
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,110
- Breast implant? - Yes.

718
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,780
You saved my life.

719
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,420
It was a mistake.

720
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,060
It caused an oculocardiac reflex

721
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,420
and you almost died.

722
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,050
It was a mistake.

723
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,680
George?

724
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,730
George?

725
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,880
Why didn't his monitor alarm go off?

726
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,460
He was stable; I disconnected it so he could use the restroom.

727
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,320
- I didn't -- - Morgan! He's gone!

728
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,920
George!

730
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,080
I was never gonna confront Andrews.

731
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,380
I was playing you.

732
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,380
But damn if you didn't actually make it work.

733
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,230
It didn't work for anybody.

734
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,840
He played us both. He set us against each other.

735
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,810
I think you were right.

736
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,480
Even if you were just bluffing,

737
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,940
we need to stand together.

738
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,190
Where was that wisdom two days ago?

739
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,950
Still in the bottle.

740
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,220
How'd you come up with that idea?

741
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,270
You mentioned breast implants and I thought --

742
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,480
That was his forehead.

743
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,090
We were operating on his eye,

744
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,550
his forehead was covered.

745
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,260
Why were you thinking of it?

746
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,850
You care about him;

747
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,760
you were worried about his problem.

748
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,930
You empathized with him.

749
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,350
My idea almost killed him.

750
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,480
No it didn't.

751
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,630
I found these in Billy's drawer.

752
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,280
Three days of pain meds.

753
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,450
He was cheeking them to build up a stash.

754
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,950
He wasn't exaggerating.

755
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,210
You saved his life, Shaun.

756
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,240
This isn't the way this should have ended...

757
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,680
But I'm not so sure the world is a worse place

758
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,460
than it was a couple hours ago.

759
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,280
You almost look comfortable behind the wheel.

760
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,870
This seat has excellent lumbar support.

761
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,850
But I am still very nervous.

762
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,280
I can drive a car.

763
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,840
I can see that.

764
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,700
Lea taught me using a very bad analogy.

765
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,680
Nothing works like a bad analogy.

766
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,680
He's getting pretty good;

767
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,920
won't be long before he gets his operator's.

768
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,750
Your next radiation appointment is in 45 minutes.

769
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,820
Thank you.
