1
00:00:01,013 --> 00:00:03,570
You're under arrest for
the murder of Kevin Bingham.

2
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:07,050
You can't save everyone, Hank.

3
00:00:07,084 --> 00:00:08,919
Just make sure I get bail.

4
00:00:08,953 --> 00:00:11,054
Alvin Olinsky has
dedicated his life

5
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:12,479
to the people of this city.

6
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,391
He dedicated his life to you.

7
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:15,824
It should be you in there.

8
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:16,960
Not him.

9
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:31,074
It has been a tough day.

10
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:32,909
But we still have jobs to do.

11
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:35,202
Chicago PD!

12
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:38,515
Okay, okay, okay...

13
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:41,024
You shot him in cold blood!

14
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:44,264
- I didn't see what happened.
- It doesn't matter!

15
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,128
We're talking about the guy
who killed Al here.

16
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:47,201
- Watch yourself, man.
- I'm right here!

17
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,259
All right, enough!

18
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:51,493
I'm sorry, Al.

19
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:05,424
Hank?

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,115
All right! All right!

21
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:13,640
Hank!

22
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:25,528
- Come on in.
- Come on in.

23
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:28,064
Okay, okay. So.

24
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:29,299
You're alive.

25
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,234
I have been calling and calling.

26
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:33,303
We've got two DOAs in Grant Park.

27
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:36,206
My God, Hank! What the hell happened?

28
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:38,286
Can I take you to the hospital?

29
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,210
No, I'm okay.

30
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:42,419
Must look worse than it is.

31
00:01:43,014 --> 00:01:44,547
I know you're going
through hell.

32
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,082
But if you, if you need help,

33
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:47,484
if you need someone to talk to...

34
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:49,219
- I'm good.
- I'm good.

35
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:50,587
I'm good.

36
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:53,056
Yeah. Right.

37
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,192
I mean, I know I'm overreacting
because you look just great,

38
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:58,728
and I don't even know why the
idea popped into my little head.

39
00:01:58,763 --> 00:02:00,145
Trudy.

40
00:02:04,702 --> 00:02:07,319
Listen, I want you to do me a favor.

41
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:16,413
Just the next time
you... you talk to Meredith,

42
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:18,081
just...

43
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:21,041
you tell her I'm gonna
take care of the funeral, okay?

44
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:25,021
Okay.

45
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:33,596
Hey.

46
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,399
Sergeant Hank Voight. Intelligence.
What's going on?

47
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:37,744
It looks like there's
a hot batch out there.

48
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:39,469
We got five ODs so far this morning,

49
00:02:39,503 --> 00:02:40,978
It's not even 1000.

50
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:43,063
Sergeant!

51
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:46,376
Get the hell off my crime scene.

52
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,235
Excuse me?

53
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,552
I called you three times.

54
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:58,154
- This about the De Leon shooting?
- Yes, it is.

55
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:00,290
Well, like I told
the review board,

56
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:01,324
it was a good shoot.

57
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:03,626
The problem is I have two
credible witnesses both say

58
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:06,162
the victim had his hands
raised up above his head.

59
00:03:06,197 --> 00:03:07,497
You listen.

60
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:09,399
First of all,

61
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,601
that guy is not a victim.
He's an offender.

62
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:13,737
He ordered the hit on Alvin Olinsky.

63
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,637
And second...

64
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,275
that's not what happened.

65
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,844
Well, it's your word
against theirs.

66
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,114
Yours is selling at quite
a discount these days.

67
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,416
State's attorney is
circling this as a homicide.

68
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,852
Best you can do is call your FOP lawyer.

69
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:30,286
There's bad drugs on the street.

70
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:31,737
Kids are dying.

71
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:34,290
It's better I'm out here.

72
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:36,092
Well, I appreciate that
you want to help.

73
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:37,694
But the facts are the facts.

74
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:39,763
This got nothing to
do with facts.

75
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:41,264
Meaning what?

76
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:45,135
Meaning I think it's a good time
for you and your boss, Kelton,

77
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:48,438
to bury an old-school white
cop with a bad reputation.

78
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:49,706
You're wrong.

79
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,441
It's an absolutely fantastic time

80
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:54,444
to bury an old-school white cop
with a bad reputation.

81
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:58,448
But that's not what I'm doing.
I'm following the facts,

82
00:03:58,482 --> 00:03:59,793
doing what's best for the department.

83
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:01,684
You are benched

84
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,186
until further notice, Sergeant.

85
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,919
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

86
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:18,501
What happened to
your face, boss?

87
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:20,203
Listen.

88
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:23,473
There is some bad dope out on the
street and we are gonna find it.

89
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:25,408
Fast.

90
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:28,001
Now, Antonio is gonna take the lead.

91
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:30,480
So get on the horn with CFD right away.

92
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:32,649
Get a list of all the ODs
the past two days,

93
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:35,185
the exact locations
the bodies were found.

94
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:37,320
Track down the 911 tapes, tox reports...

95
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:38,655
- I got it, Hank.
- I'm good.

96
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:39,987
Sarge, you want to
tell us what's going on?

97
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:41,720
Why aren't you involved?

98
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:44,594
The COPA thing. They're still
investigating the shooting.

99
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:46,696
Listen, I'm on the bench
until it's resolved.

100
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,931
Way to step up, bro.

101
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:49,232
Stay out of this, Adam.

102
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:52,526
Hey. Enough.

103
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:56,446
Now listen, everything is gonna be fine.

104
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,843
So stop talking,

105
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:01,778
and track down that bad dope.

106
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:03,829
Okay, let's get to work.

107
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:06,950
That's my son.

108
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:08,618
- That's my baby!
- I'm sorry...

109
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:10,753
- Let me go!
- Let me see my baby.

110
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,856
Ma'am.

111
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,858
It's okay, it's okay.

112
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:19,429
Same tox report for
all five DOAs.

113
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:20,763
Heroin cut with battery acid.

114
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:22,198
- Battery acid?
- Really?

115
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,533
That means it's intentional.

116
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,579
It means somebody's trying
to put bodies on the street.

117
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:27,756
Wait, so, is this business

118
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,584
or is this some sicko serial killer
out here just trying to kill people

119
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:31,808
with dope instead of bullets?

120
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:33,610
Well, all five ODs

121
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:35,814
are on the West Side between
Sacramento and California.

122
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,145
It's confined to one area,

123
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,119
which is a good thing.

124
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:39,246
What about the crime scenes?

125
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:41,649
Detectives found packets
at three out of five locations.

126
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:43,317
They all had the same logo A spider.

127
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:45,152
Yeah, well, maybe we
should call Voight,

128
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:45,902
see if he can at least point us
in the right direction.

129
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:47,375
No. We can't.

130
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,621
Hank's off the books until COPA's
done with the investigation.

131
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:51,756
Right, yeah, I know that, but
there's five people dead

132
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,987
and the clock's ticking, so...

133
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:55,156
Voight's not involved,
you understand?

134
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:56,458
He's been stripped.

135
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:58,758
It's violation to even talk
to him about any of this.

136
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:05,166
All right, talk to Narcotics.

137
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:06,812
See who the shot-callers
are and who's supplying

138
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:08,069
product with a spider logo.

139
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:09,767
All these kids copped somewhere.

140
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,383
Hopefully that somewhere is
connected to the same corner.

141
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:14,309
- I think they are. I ran the phones.
- All five trace back

142
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:15,977
to the same burner. Gotta be the dealer.

143
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,389
Pinged it, looks like he's doing business

144
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:19,154
on the corner of Sacramento and Fillmore.

145
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:21,198
Okay.

146
00:06:22,017 --> 00:06:23,408
Here's what we're gonna do.

147
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:27,628
Dealer's name is Andre
Thompson, AKA Little Dre.

148
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:30,859
5'9", 135 pounds.
19 years old, two priors.

149
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:32,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I think I got him.

150
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:33,995
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

151
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:36,230
He's working near the
southeast corner, you see that?

152
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,965
- Blue jacket.
- Yeah, yeah, I see him.

153
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:45,430
So this Antonio thing.

154
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:47,699
I don't want to talk about that.

155
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,701
- He didn't see the shooting, Ruzek.
- My God.

156
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:51,036
That doesn't matter.

157
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,604
- Yeah, it matters.
- No, it doesn't.

158
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:54,716
It doesn't matter. Not in
this situation, it doesn't.

159
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,709
Not when the dead guy got
exactly what he deserved.

160
00:06:57,743 --> 00:06:59,221
We're talking about the guy
who ordered the hit on Al.

161
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:01,546
- I get it.
- No. Hey.

162
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:02,914
Antonio was right that.

163
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:05,242
Voight's future hinges on his word.

164
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:08,370
He had the opportunity to back
up his brother and he didn't.

165
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:10,789
And I don't know why.

166
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:13,083
But he didn't, and that's
the end of the story.

167
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:15,627
- End of your story, maybe.
- Hailey.

168
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:16,962
Look, what I'm saying is

169
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:19,297
it's not as simple as you make it sound.

170
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:21,841
Just keep that in mind.

171
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:26,671
Found his jab.

172
00:07:26,706 --> 00:07:28,006
Where?

173
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,307
Deflated basketball.

174
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:31,268
It's in the shopping cart.

175
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:35,080
Jay, we're up with solid
eyes, ready to roll.

176
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:36,948
Copy that.

177
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:44,239
Yo, what's up, bro?

178
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,002
Looks like you in the wrong
neighborhood, homey.

179
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,303
No, Dre, I'm here
to see you, man.

180
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:49,694
We just talked on the phone.

181
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,596
I'm friends with Nick, from Evanston.

182
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:52,931
Long black hair?

183
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:54,599
No. No, it's light, like mine.

184
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:55,811
And it's shaved like a Marine.

185
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:57,778
Come on, man. Just help me out, bro.

186
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,204
How much you want?

187
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:01,172
Couple grams.

188
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:03,341
- I could do that.
- All right, cool.

189
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:04,809
Heyo, 5-0!

190
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:06,711
Chicago PD, hands on the hood.

191
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:08,179
Hands on the hood.

192
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:09,948
- Hey! Hands on the hood!
- Get on the hood!

193
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:11,149
Hold on, hold on.

194
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:12,350
I ain't got no dope.

195
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:13,395
I told you, I ain't got no dope!

196
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,720
- You keep your head down.
- You got the wrong man.

197
00:08:15,755 --> 00:08:17,389
Jay Campbell from Winnetka.

198
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:18,990
What you doing on the West Side, Jay?

199
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,669
- I'm lost, man.
- I'm looking for directions.

200
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:21,693
- You good?
- Yeah.

201
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:22,727
Okay. Y'all good to go.

202
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:23,872
Sorry for the inconvenience.

203
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:26,064
That wasn't no inconvenience.

204
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:28,133
That was a violation of
my Constitutional rights.

205
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,235
People are dying because
of this dope you selling.

206
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:33,038
Now's a bad time to give me
lectures on the Constitution.

207
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:36,583
Kevin.

208
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:38,668
Kevin.

209
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,271
Andre's hot.

210
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:07,839
He should be.

211
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:10,617
Just lost thousands of dollars'
worth of someone else's drugs.

212
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:14,846
"Do I call my supplier
and admit I screwed up,

213
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,749
"or keep my mouth shut and pay the G note

214
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:19,250
out of my own pocket?"

215
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:22,854
And the answer is...

216
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:23,888
choice A.

217
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:25,173
Always is.

218
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:31,463
All right.

219
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:33,965
Okay, we got a phone number
and an address,

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,368
8660 West 54th Street.

221
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:38,478
- Let's go get this punk.
- Yeah.

222
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:41,439
We've got five dead
bodies, Jalen.

223
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:43,241
Make that six.

224
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:45,310
Patrol just found her in
an alley off Lexington.

225
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:47,112
Amy Moore, 19.

226
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:49,214
Last number she dialed,
same as the other five...

227
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:50,382
your boy, Andre.

228
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,916
Sorry, I don't know no Andre.

229
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,752
No? He's the skinny black dude

230
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,230
who works the corner of
Sacramento and Fillmore.

231
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:56,955
You know, the one you sell heroin to?

232
00:09:56,989 --> 00:09:58,767
The one who just called
'cause he lost his jab.

233
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,235
Y'all must have me
confused with someone else.

234
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,393
Like, for real.

235
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:02,738
I don't know nothing about no dope.

236
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:03,928
Really? Nothing?

237
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:05,430
Yeah. Nothing.

238
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:06,840
What's that?

239
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,927
We found that in a hidden
compartment in your passenger door.

240
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:11,436
It's not mine.

241
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,804
Look, man.

242
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:15,240
If you give up your supplier,
you'll get out in five.

243
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:18,076
If you don't, we're gonna charge
you with narcotic-induced homicide

244
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,811
and you die in prison.

245
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,457
So why don't you do
yourself a favor, Jalen?

246
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:23,940
Start talking.

247
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:27,285
All right, sure thing.

248
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:28,862
Good.

249
00:10:30,222 --> 00:10:32,090
But only after you
get on your knees

250
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:33,992
and kiss my black ass.

251
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:36,953
Pass.

252
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,108
But I'm sure you're gonna meet
some new friends in prison

253
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:42,709
that are gonna be happy to
take you up on that offer.

254
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:47,872
He's laughing at us.

255
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:50,041
There's people dying
and this kid's laughing.

256
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:53,445
He doesn't want to talk, there's
nothing we can do about it.

257
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,571
All right, I know you're
supposed to be on the bench...

258
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:10,806
I told you, Antonio
is in charge.

259
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,230
We got six dead.

260
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:13,975
They're all under 20.
It's not even lunch yet.

261
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,400
Six?

262
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:17,368
They found another one.

263
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:24,586
All right, I'll see what I can do.

264
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,462
- But this stays between us.
- Of course.

265
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,982
All right, everybody. What
else do we know Anabout Jalen?

266
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:40,696
Um, he's affiliated
with the Black Tiger Posse,

267
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:42,007
has two priors, both drug-related.

268
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:44,347
Okay, so we work
this up and down.

269
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,574
Burgess, Atwater, start
with the kid on the corner.

270
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:48,599
Andre. Wave those homicides

271
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:50,277
under his nose, see if he bites.

272
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:53,214
The rest of you work your sources
and find Jalen's suppliers.

273
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:56,183
Who sold the product to him?
Who's behind the spider logo?

274
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:58,129
And coordinate with Patrol.
I want them to put up fliers

275
00:11:58,153 --> 00:11:59,961
so that everyone in the neighborhood
knows what's going on out there.

276
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,277
All right, put up fliers?

277
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:04,279
We sure that's a good idea?

278
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:06,648
Demand usually goes up
when ODs start happening

279
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,917
because the junkies think that
the dope's super-charged.

280
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:11,875
Put word out, that might
do more harm than good.

281
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,922
I get it, but it's better
to be transparent.

282
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:15,301
This way the people decide
for themselves.

283
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:17,136
Right, even if it's gonna
kill more people?

284
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:21,474
- Okay, let's go.
- We don't have much time.

285
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:24,766
All right, man.

286
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:26,271
Adam, hang back a sec.

287
00:12:33,876 --> 00:12:35,029
Yeah?

288
00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:37,365
Look.

289
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:40,215
I know you're upset

290
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,703
about Al.

291
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:43,496
About Voight.

292
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:45,593
But we got work to do here.

293
00:12:45,822 --> 00:12:47,417
So no more crap.

294
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:51,059
Whatever you say.

295
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:52,714
You're the boss.

296
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:05,741
- All right, I got a name for you.
- Phil Gamble.

297
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:07,052
Supplies the product
to all the black gangs

298
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:08,176
this part of the West Side.

299
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:09,397
Phil Gamble?

300
00:13:10,213 --> 00:13:12,714
- I've never heard of him before.
- He's a pro.

301
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:14,850
He minds his own business,
stays under the radar.

302
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:17,229
Why would someone like that
pump bad dope onto the streets?

303
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:18,654
That doesn't seem to make sense.

304
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:19,855
Well, that I don't know.

305
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:22,224
What I do know, he's the man
behind the spider logo,

306
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:25,160
which means he's involved,
intentionally or unintentionally.

307
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:27,034
So talk to him, see if
you can catch him dirty.

308
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:28,930
He owns a bar called The Trick.

309
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:30,251
- Copy that.
- Hey, boss.

310
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,001
This...

311
00:13:33,036 --> 00:13:35,203
shooting investigation.

312
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:36,838
You gonna be all right?

313
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:38,874
You got an angle to play?

314
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:40,008
Yeah.

315
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:41,679
It's called the truth.

316
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:47,015
I told you.

317
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,717
I ain't got nothing to say.

318
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:50,852
We've got six kids
on a slab at the morgue

319
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:52,197
because of your dope,
and you're gonna pull

320
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:53,399
the "I got nothing to say" card?

321
00:13:53,423 --> 00:13:56,024
- My dope?
- What makes you say that?

322
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:58,860
Phil, it's being sold
in an area you control,

323
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:00,782
and it's got your logo on it.

324
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:03,398
You sure about that?

325
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,078
Very.

326
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:10,872
- Come on, Phil.
- What's going on here?

327
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:12,741
Who's cutting your product
with battery acid?

328
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:14,053
That doesn't happen by accident.

329
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:16,978
Look, bro, it's clear you don't
know what we're talking about.

330
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:18,213
So help us.

331
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:21,450
Help us get this crap off the street
before it kills anybody else.

332
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:24,460
And we can work out
some sort of deal, all right?

333
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:26,224
But you got to help us now.

334
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:34,129
No.

335
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:35,733
Like I said before...

336
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,444
I ain't got nothing to say.

337
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,072
Now it's best you leave...

338
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:44,283
Officers.

339
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:58,253
No luck, man. Talked to a
bunch of low-level dealers.

340
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:01,089
Kids, really, like 16, 17.
They don't know anything.

341
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:02,603
Did confiscate half an ounce, though.

342
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:04,092
Yeah, we struck out too.

343
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:07,195
Tried to squeeze this guy named
Gamble but he wasn't having it.

344
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,307
Gamble? Who the hell is he?

345
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,843
Word is he controls the spot where
the hot loads were being sold.

346
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:13,468
But, like I said,
he shot us down pretty quickly.

347
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:16,371
Yeah, he seemed more
confused than anything.

348
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:19,274
Like he had no idea the ODs
were connected to his dope.

349
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:20,744
How'd you hear about this guy?

350
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:22,778
Adam's CI.

351
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:25,180
- Yeah, I've got a source.
- He knows the area pretty good.

352
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:26,948
- A source.
- Yeah.

353
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:28,494
This source on the books?

354
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:30,786
No, not yet.

355
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,387
He got a name?

356
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:33,647
Excuse me?

357
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,223
Are you talking to Voight?

358
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:36,402
I'm talking to whoever can
give us good info...

359
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:37,893
So you're talking to him?

360
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:39,204
Antonio, we got six people dead.

361
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:40,862
What does it matter who I talk to

362
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,898
or where I get my information from?

363
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:44,510
I'm trying to solve the case!

364
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:46,472
This is insane.

365
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:53,559
Look.

366
00:15:53,593 --> 00:15:55,510
I know you're pissed about
this Voight thing.

367
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:58,313
But that's your issue. Not mine.

368
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:00,215
Don't jam me up in all this.

369
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:01,555
Understand?

370
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:40,132
Yeah, the guys are
loading it up right now...

371
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:42,624
Hey. Sergeant Hank Voight,
Chicago PD.

372
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:43,879
Let me call you back.

373
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,894
Listen, you got a
surveillance camera

374
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:47,863
on the roof. I think it's facing east.

375
00:16:47,897 --> 00:16:49,408
I need to see the footage.

376
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,544
This about the shooting
the other day?

377
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:53,535
Yeah, listen.

378
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:56,238
I just need to see the tape.
It shouldn't take long.

379
00:16:56,272 --> 00:16:57,439
I'd give it to you,

380
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:59,374
but some people already came for it.

381
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:00,375
People?

382
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:02,444
Police. Guys in suits.

383
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:04,045
Said they were with Internal Affairs.

384
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,466
Hold on a sec.

385
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:08,316
- So you gave them the tape, right?
- Yeah.

386
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,384
About an hour ago.

387
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:11,222
You see the video yourself?

388
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:14,633
Were you in the room when the
police were watching it?

389
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:16,091
No.

390
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,437
I just, I let them in the office,
showed them where everything was,

391
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:20,095
then left.

392
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:23,231
Ten minutes later they're walking
out the door with my machine.

393
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,152
They give me the machine back, right?

394
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:27,655
Yeah.

395
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:32,535
I'd be happy to show you
the footage if we had any.

396
00:17:35,611 --> 00:17:37,612
There's no surveillance video?

397
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:39,125
So I've been told.

398
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:45,921
Well, I think you might have
been told wrong.

399
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:47,355
Excuse me?

400
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,902
- There is video of the shooting.
- It exists.

401
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:53,139
And you and I both know it.

402
00:17:55,131 --> 00:17:56,965
What I didn't know until just now,

403
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,061
until you denied its existence...

404
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:02,437
That video confirms it was a good shoot.

405
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:04,483
- That's preposterous.
- Why would I withhold evidence

406
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:06,007
of a good police shooting?

407
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,677
- Yeah, why would you?
- I don't know.

408
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:11,032
Could ruin your next campaign speech.

409
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:13,326
Like that one you give...

410
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:17,118
The one about the...
CPD cleaning up its act,

411
00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:19,988
getting rid of all those white,
middle-aged, cowboy cops.

412
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:21,292
That one?

413
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:24,536
I mean, it's worth a hell of a
lot more on the campaign trail

414
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,297
than a good police shooting.

415
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,053
Like I said. No tape.

416
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:36,932
You're excused, Sergeant.

417
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,625
Guys, that was Meredith.

418
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,987
She asked us to be
the pallbearers tomorrow.

419
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,230
- Platt...
- Yeah?

420
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,400
- We need more officers on the street.
- We gotta be two deep

421
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,944
on every dope corner
in that neighborhood.

422
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,236
I'll try, but I've only got
so many bodies.

423
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,238
Hey, I've been going back
through Jalen's phone,

424
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,340
and the last three days he made 22 calls

425
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,908
to the same burner in Pilsen.

426
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,944
- Pilsen?
- So a black dealer named Jalen

427
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,345
who works the West Side

428
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,957
is chatting with a Mexican cat in Pilsen?

429
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,081
- That's right.
- Yo, Jay.

430
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,116
I ran that name you gave me through HIDTA

431
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,786
and it came back hot.
Guy named Ernesto Varga.

432
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,431
Plugged to some major suppliers
in Mexico.

433
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,456
All right, track him down fast.

434
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,868
- Chicago PD.
- Ernesto Varga?

435
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,112
Anybody home?

436
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,905
Body.

437
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,370
Yeah, he's dead.

438
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,292
Shots fired! Shots fired!

439
00:19:46,438 --> 00:19:48,005
Copy that, 50-21 David.

440
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,310
We've got cars rolling your way.

441
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,628
Everyone else stay off the air.

442
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,198
Agh!

443
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,466
- What?
- It's a kid.

444
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,686
- What?
- It's a kid.

445
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:06,742
Hey, buddy.

446
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:09,144
It's the police. Okay? We're the police.

447
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:10,145
- Put the gun down.
- Son of a bitch.

448
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:13,081
- All right?
- We're here to help you.

449
00:20:13,116 --> 00:20:14,616
Okay?

450
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:16,818
You speak English? Habla ingles?

451
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:18,553
Put the gun down!

452
00:20:18,588 --> 00:20:20,322
All right? No more shooting.

453
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:21,923
All right?

454
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:28,063
- Screw this, man.
- Hey, hey, hey.

455
00:20:28,097 --> 00:20:29,575
Stay right there.
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

456
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,963
Don't shoot.

457
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:33,168
- I got this.
- Hey.

458
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:34,366
What are you doing?

459
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,570
- No mas pistola.
- Kev.

460
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:36,772
- Okay?
- Kevin.

461
00:20:36,806 --> 00:20:38,106
Put your gun down, I got this.

462
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:39,741
Kevin, pick your gun up.

463
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:40,853
It's on the floor, okay, buddy?

464
00:20:40,877 --> 00:20:43,078
- Kevin. Kev.
- You see that? I got this.

465
00:20:43,112 --> 00:20:44,646
Don't. Don't.

466
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:46,270
- Hey.
- Don't.

467
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,251
- It's okay.
- Kev.

468
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:50,763
- No, please don't do this.
- I got this.

469
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:52,097
- No, man.
- Let me do this, okay?

470
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:53,265
You see that? It's just me and you.

471
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,823
Don't.

472
00:20:54,857 --> 00:20:56,989
Me, you.

473
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,294
Okay?

474
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:01,263
My hands up, gun's on the floor.

475
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:02,597
Hey, hey.

476
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:04,966
Stand down. Stand down.

477
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:06,935
Stand down, Ruz, I got it.

478
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:09,148
I got it, just let me do this.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look at me.

479
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:10,628
Look at me.

480
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:14,048
See? Put the gun down.

481
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:16,611
Down.

482
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,013
Slow.

483
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:19,948
It's okay. Put the gun down.

484
00:21:19,982 --> 00:21:21,950
Take your finger off the trigger.

485
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:23,685
Finger off the trigger.

486
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,188
Okay? He's gonna be okay.
He about to put it down.

487
00:21:26,222 --> 00:21:27,956
Finger off the trigger. There you go.

488
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:31,660
Bueno. Down.

489
00:21:31,694 --> 00:21:33,275
There you go.

490
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:36,862
Lo siento!

491
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:40,324
Lo siento...

492
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:44,806
- Lo siento...
- It's okay.

493
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:49,083
Everything's all right.

494
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:52,881
You're good.

495
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:55,427
Varga was dead when we got here. We
missed the shooting by ten minutes.

496
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:56,685
Give or take.

497
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,320
Yeah, blood was still fresh.

498
00:21:58,354 --> 00:22:00,322
But the kid is okay?

499
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:02,324
The Patrol took him down

500
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,326
to Chicago Med to get checked out.

501
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,437
Was he able to ID the shooter?

502
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:08,163
No, he was hiding in his room.

503
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:10,232
Said he heard someone
arguing with his dad

504
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:11,981
and two gunshots.

505
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:16,014
- All right, what's it look like to you?
- A robbery or what?

506
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:18,039
No, we found $20,000 in cash

507
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:20,108
and a Rolex, so...

508
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:21,676
definitely wasn't just a robbery.

509
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:23,409
Yeah, more like
a straight-up hit.

510
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:29,017
All right, you two need
anything, let me know.

511
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:30,082
Yeah.

512
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:42,431
- What the hell was that, man?
- Why'd you go in like that?

513
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:43,804
What was that?

514
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,801
Worried about the kid.

515
00:22:45,835 --> 00:22:46,879
And you thought I was
gonna shoot him?

516
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:48,069
Yeah. And if you did...

517
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:49,435
I wasn't gonna shoot him.

518
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:52,521
Adam, I hear you.

519
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,745
And that is the right call.

520
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:58,323
It's a kid with a gun.
He wasn't listening.

521
00:22:58,347 --> 00:23:00,029
But I couldn't watch that happen.

522
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,198
I said I wasn't gonna shoot him.

523
00:23:10,326 --> 00:23:13,428
All right, look, I know
it's a tough play.

524
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:15,336
I didn't know what to do.

525
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:18,589
But, Kev, you go in like that...

526
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:22,504
the position you put me in, what
choice do I have right there?

527
00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:24,739
I shoot a little kid or I...

528
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:26,263
watch him shoot you?

529
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:28,844
That ain't right, man.

530
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:30,142
It's just...

531
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,316
I can't bear to have

532
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,412
another one of my friends die this week.

533
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:41,945
I can't bear it, man.

534
00:23:55,238 --> 00:23:56,877
Recognize that dude?

535
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:00,756
This dude right here.

536
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:03,050
That dude?

537
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:06,929
- Ernesto Varga ring a bell?
- No.

538
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:09,284
You called him 22 times
this week.

539
00:24:09,318 --> 00:24:10,496
I don't know what you're
talking about.

540
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,120
Jalen, it's over, man.

541
00:24:12,154 --> 00:24:13,355
We all know what's going on.

542
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:14,523
And if we know,

543
00:24:14,557 --> 00:24:15,704
you can be damn sure Gamble knows.

544
00:24:15,728 --> 00:24:17,025
Knows what?

545
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:19,160
The game that you
and Varga are playing.

546
00:24:19,195 --> 00:24:21,443
Putting out poison
under his logo.

547
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:24,176
Trying to convince people
it was him killing folks.

548
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,535
Or maybe you were just trying
to frame his ass.

549
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:29,004
Hoping that we'd blame him for the ODs,

550
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:30,549
get him off the street,
open up the market.

551
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:32,207
- I get it.
- Look, either way,

552
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:35,143
it's clear the two of you were
trying to roll up old Phil Gamble,

553
00:24:35,177 --> 00:24:37,479
take his customers. That's clear.

554
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,551
Did you know about
the battery acid?

555
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:44,319
Or was that Varga's idea?

556
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:45,487
Because if you didn't,

557
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:47,055
we can work with you, man.

558
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:49,132
All right? We can blame it
on the dead guy.

559
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:50,839
Yeah, I keep telling you. I don't
know what you're talking about.

560
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:52,273
Jalen, I'm starting to
lose my patience.

561
00:24:52,297 --> 00:24:53,412
- Give me my lawyer, bitch.
- "Bitch"?

562
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:56,401
"Bitch"? I'll give you your bitch.

563
00:24:56,435 --> 00:24:58,474
You and me, we're gonna take a walk...

564
00:24:58,509 --> 00:24:59,565
You're going to tell where is the dope.

565
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:01,706
Let him go, Adam! Enough! Enough!

566
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:02,974
Kevin, bring him downstairs.

567
00:25:03,008 --> 00:25:05,210
- Get him processed now.
- Yeah.

568
00:25:05,244 --> 00:25:07,679
- Okay.
- Move, move.

569
00:25:07,713 --> 00:25:09,825
- What the hell are you doing?
- What the hell am I doing?

570
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:11,316
He knows where the dope is!

571
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,184
- It doesn't matter!
- He lawyered up!

572
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,053
You hear me?

573
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:20,859
Hold on.

574
00:25:20,893 --> 00:25:22,296
No, no, no.

575
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,897
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?
- Adam, just let it go.

576
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:28,233
- Everyone's doing everything we can.
- No, we are not.

577
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:30,197
No, we are not, not by a long shot.

578
00:25:30,222 --> 00:25:31,789
Antonio, if Voight was here

579
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:32,970
the dope would be off the street by now!

580
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:34,636
- But he isn't here, is he?
- Yeah, why's that?

581
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,027
We're doing it my way!

582
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:37,135
- Hey! Hey!
- And if you don't like it,

583
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:38,896
- then get the hell out!
- Hey!

584
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:43,901
I have an update.

585
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:46,490
- Three more dead.
- My God.

586
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:48,559
- Two female.
- Both white, both 18.

587
00:25:48,593 --> 00:25:50,661
One male, Hispanic, 20.

588
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:52,630
Same spider logo on the empty packets.

589
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:54,098
- Come on, let's go.
- Go.

590
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:55,718
You heard her. Get to the scene.

591
00:26:12,257 --> 00:26:14,292
I'm doing the best
I can, Sarge, but

592
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:16,093
this kid Jalen, he's not talking,

593
00:26:16,127 --> 00:26:18,862
and I can't do anything about
it 'cause Antonio's on my ass.

594
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:20,774
All right, I'll take it
from here.

595
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:22,132
What do you mean?

596
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,992
Been talking to Phil Gamble. He
gave me some useful information.

597
00:26:26,027 --> 00:26:28,105
- Like what?
- Doesn't matter.

598
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:30,590
I'm gonna call you in 30 minutes.

599
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:33,159
Just make sure your phone is
on, you have access to Jalen,

600
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:34,727
and you're alone. You got it?

601
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:36,863
- Yep.
- All right.

602
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,601
- Dawson, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

603
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:43,251
- Close it.
- Yep.

604
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:46,506
- What the hell is going on out there?
- We got nine dead.

605
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,907
I know. It's a bad situation,

606
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,497
but I assure you we're doing
everything we can.

607
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:51,288
These overdoses are
a black eye on this city,

608
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:52,846
on this police department.

609
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,247
Drug arrests are up 34%

610
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:56,683
yet we got bodies dropping all over town.

611
00:26:56,717 --> 00:26:59,552
You need to find these drugs
before another body drops.

612
00:26:59,587 --> 00:27:00,620
I'm trying my hardest.

613
00:27:00,654 --> 00:27:02,956
Nobody cares how hard
you try, detective.

614
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,090
This isn't kindergarten.

615
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,593
We don't give A's for effort.

616
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,235
Get it done.

617
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:06,196
Yeah, they're having
their anniversary sale,

618
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,954
so, like, everything's 50% off.

619
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:09,622
Yeah, girl, no.

620
00:28:09,657 --> 00:28:12,792
You're telling me.
No, she's doing great.

621
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:14,217
You know.

622
00:28:15,296 --> 00:28:17,630
You know, with poor people,
it's, like, a lifesaver.

623
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:19,042
No, I'm making dinner right
now, and then...

624
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:20,600
um, yeah...

625
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:22,835
- Shh, shh.
- Stay calm.

626
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,561
Stay calm.

627
00:28:25,072 --> 00:28:26,773
Tell her you'll call her back

628
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:29,776
and hang up the phone, you understand?

629
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,778
Okay, good.

630
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:34,213
I-I'll call you back, all right?

631
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:35,614
Give me the phone.

632
00:28:36,573 --> 00:28:39,159
Listen. Just relax.

633
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:42,387
- Please don't hurt me. I...
- Shh.

634
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,623
Where's the money?

635
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,795
Where does Jalen keep the cash?

636
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:51,130
- He'll kill me.
- Jalen is in jail.

637
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:53,866
He's gonna be there
for 15 years, maybe more.

638
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:58,204
Look, you help me,

639
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,013
I'll help you.

640
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:09,048
Come on.

641
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,108
Yeah, boss, I'm almost there.

642
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:13,853
Jalen.

643
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:15,254
Nah, I told you I ain't talking.

644
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,666
Yeah, we're gonna give you
one more opportunity

645
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,157
to tell us where the product is.

646
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:19,359
Jalen, look at the phone.

647
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:21,060
Yo, look at the phone.

648
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:23,162
Hey, Jalen, guess who I'm with?

649
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:25,032
Vanessa.

650
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:26,531
The mother of your beautiful son.

651
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:27,711
Yo, what the hell are you doing?

652
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:29,869
- Easy, easy.
- Just shut up and listen.

653
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:32,739
Now you tell me where
that hot dope is

654
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,798
and you can keep all the money.

655
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:39,010
All $170,000 of it.

656
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:42,222
You don't...

657
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,183
and I'll burn every dollar.

658
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:45,885
- Yo, that's hers.
- You can't touch it.

659
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,936
Yeah, you think I'm bluffing?

660
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:50,890
Jalen, come on, please.

661
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:53,483
Jalen, tell him where it is, come on.

662
00:29:54,061 --> 00:29:55,895
Start talking, Jalen.

663
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:58,264
Or I'll burn every dollar.

664
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,073
That's a lot of money.

665
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,139
Okay.

666
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:08,241
Man, I'll tell you what you need to know.

667
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:12,211
But I-I promise I didn't know
Varga cut it with battery acid.

668
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:14,911
He was supposed to use
some sort of laxative...

669
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:16,803
- Yo, yo.
- Make people sick.

670
00:30:16,837 --> 00:30:18,242
- The time for feeling bad...
- He didn't say nothing about.

671
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:20,131
Listen to me. We need to
know where the product is.

672
00:30:20,155 --> 00:30:22,220
All right? Tell us now.

673
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:30,257
Jalen just confessed.
He gave up the stash house.

674
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:31,792
- What?
- He lawyered up.

675
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:33,104
You weren't even supposed to
be talking to him.

676
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:35,029
The address is
3220 Edgemont Road.

677
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:36,464
There's 1/2 kilo sitting there

678
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:38,338
just waiting to kill
another 10, 20, 50 people.

679
00:30:38,366 --> 00:30:40,134
And he just volunteered this.

680
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:41,936
- Yes.
- You're lying.

681
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,105
You wanna be right
or you wanna save lives?

682
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:47,913
It's your call.

683
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,752
Let's gear up and hit
this place now.

684
00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:11,585
Hands up!

685
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,321
Now, get your hands up and turn around!

686
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:15,491
- On the wall, on the wall!
- Don't look at me... turn around.

687
00:31:15,515 --> 00:31:16,782
Hands on the counter.

688
00:31:16,816 --> 00:31:17,783
- Let's go, let's go.
- Get down.

689
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:18,897
Nobody move.

690
00:31:18,932 --> 00:31:21,286
Everybody keep their hands
where they are.

691
00:31:21,321 --> 00:31:23,622
We're just gonna make the rounds.

692
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,760
Go.

693
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:37,217
Come on, come on...

694
00:31:37,252 --> 00:31:39,151
- You hear that?
- Yeah, I hear 'em.

695
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:40,636
You guys good? You're good?

696
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,157
- Yeah.
- Police!

697
00:31:43,182 --> 00:31:44,716
- Hey! Hey!
- Nobody move!

698
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,717
Put your hands against the wall!

699
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:47,218
Hey, put your hands up.

700
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:48,330
Hey, why don't you three come
to me, okay?

701
00:31:48,354 --> 00:31:49,320
- Move against the wall!
- Now!

702
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:50,588
Come to me, yeah.

703
00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:51,923
Now go up against the wall.

704
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:53,235
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

705
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:54,726
Why don't you put
your hands down?

706
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,770
Everything's okay, I'm Officer Burgess.

707
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:56,961
Are you okay?

708
00:31:56,996 --> 00:31:58,006
Are you okay and are you okay?

709
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,063
Has anyone hurt you?

710
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:00,131
Real slow.

711
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:01,799
No? You're all right?

712
00:32:12,678 --> 00:32:14,746
Hey, hey.

713
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,258
Okay. So you found the dope, congrats.

714
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:17,464
Now we talk about what just happened.

715
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:18,617
We just solved the problem.

716
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:19,730
- That's what just happened.
- No.

717
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:21,647
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And
that's all you need to know.

718
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:23,254
So back up.

719
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:24,822
What did you say?

720
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:26,858
I said back up!

721
00:32:35,748 --> 00:32:39,253
- Hey!
- Come on!

722
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:40,838
Get off me!

723
00:32:40,873 --> 00:32:42,140
This ain't over, you hear me?

724
00:32:42,174 --> 00:32:43,141
Let's finish it now!

725
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:44,676
Get outside!

726
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,644
- Let's finish it now!
- Turn around!

727
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,279
Turn around and shut up!

728
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:51,282
Come on, man! The hell is wrong with you?

729
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,651
Give it a look,
email should be sent by now.

730
00:32:53,686 --> 00:32:56,054
I appreciate you doing
this, Franny.

731
00:32:56,088 --> 00:32:58,460
- You do what you gotta do, man.
- Just leave me out of it.

732
00:33:21,153 --> 00:33:22,442
We gotta talk.

733
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:25,436
Congratulations, you guys
are all over the news.

734
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,571
What happened?

735
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:29,761
I had an angle and I played it.

736
00:33:29,786 --> 00:33:31,186
Why?

737
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:34,025
To make me look bad
because I didn't cover for you?

738
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:36,160
I was trying to help.

739
00:33:36,195 --> 00:33:38,208
I'm trying to save lives.

740
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:41,766
Yeah. Then why didn't
you tell me?

741
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,399
- Hey, come here.
- Come on.

742
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,882
Why didn't I tell you?

743
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:49,370
'Cause I didn't want to jam you up.

744
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:50,738
What's that mean?

745
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:53,389
Antonio, I need you clean.

746
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:58,046
I know things've been choppy, but...

747
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,615
Bro, I like the fact you
have your own code

748
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:01,960
even if it's different from mine.

749
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:03,483
Listen to me.

750
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,854
The best thing you can be

751
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:08,279
is you.

752
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,783
The best thing I can be is me.

753
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,370
I mean, it's not easy. I get it.

754
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:18,289
Bro, we pull it off...

755
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:22,752
Everybody wins.

756
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,276
Sorry I'm late.

757
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:51,799
Such a beautiful city.

758
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,134
That why you texted me?

759
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:55,503
To talk about Chicago architecture?

760
00:34:55,537 --> 00:34:56,604
No.

761
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:59,038
I wanted to thank you
for finding the bad dope.

762
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:01,576
Wasn't me, I'm on suspension.

763
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,251
Dawson told me everything.

764
00:35:04,046 --> 00:35:05,780
Said if it wasn't for your intel

765
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,922
there would be 50 more dead
bodies on the street.

766
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:11,759
And I wanted to apologize
for our conversation earlier.

767
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:13,928
I was wrong.

768
00:35:14,623 --> 00:35:16,890
Turns out there is some
footage of the shooting.

769
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,927
You get a chance to review it?

770
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:21,462
You bet.

771
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:22,937
It was...

772
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:26,968
more ambiguous than I was led to believe.

773
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:28,770
It's not ambiguous.

774
00:35:28,804 --> 00:35:31,539
He reached for his gun so I shot him.

775
00:35:31,573 --> 00:35:33,941
I'm not sure COPA would
agree with that...

776
00:35:33,976 --> 00:35:35,909
without my help.

777
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:39,781
- It was a good shoot.
- I don't need any help.

778
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:41,414
Don't be stupid.

779
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,458
We all need help.

780
00:35:45,754 --> 00:35:48,171
I guess it depends on the cost.

781
00:35:52,594 --> 00:35:54,969
I want you to support
Kelton for mayor.

782
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:57,388
Support him how?

783
00:35:58,734 --> 00:36:00,835
I need someone I can rely on

784
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:03,004
to help solve cases in a hurry.

785
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:04,437
Or...

786
00:36:04,907 --> 00:36:08,209
not in a hurry, depending on the facts.

787
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:10,151
Or the circumstances.

788
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:16,150
So you want me to be...

789
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:18,243
My friend.

790
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:26,084
I need something too.

791
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:29,003
Like what?

792
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:32,549
A letter of exoneration

793
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:35,203
for Alvin Olinsky.

794
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:38,888
So his wife and child
can collect his pension.

795
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:42,725
That's a big ask.

796
00:36:43,645 --> 00:36:45,645
That's my price

797
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:49,232
for being your friend.

798
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:54,404
I'll see what I can do.

799
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:10,571
Hey, you back on the job?

800
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:12,039
Got the official call
an hour ago.

801
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:13,381
All right.

802
00:37:14,643 --> 00:37:15,643
Good to see you, boss.

803
00:37:15,677 --> 00:37:17,093
You too.

804
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,889
- Hailey. Kim.
- Hi.

805
00:37:33,095 --> 00:37:34,360
All right.

806
00:37:35,097 --> 00:37:37,598
- I'm glad you're back, Hank.
- Yeah, well...

807
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,324
Me too.

808
00:37:44,206 --> 00:37:45,872
Listen, um...

809
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:49,876
It has been a very long few days.

810
00:37:50,946 --> 00:37:53,314
With a lot of pain.

811
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:54,839
A lot of anger.

812
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:56,966
I get it.

813
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:00,254
And I don't expect these emotions

814
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:02,722
to just disappear overnight.

815
00:38:04,226 --> 00:38:06,059
But going forward,

816
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:08,603
we need to be a team.

817
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:12,023
One team.

818
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:15,970
No more fighting.

819
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:17,320
No more crap.

820
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,997
Hey. Everything all right?

821
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:44,031
Yeah.

822
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:45,700
Hank, I tried calling.

823
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:46,701
But, um...

824
00:38:46,735 --> 00:38:48,226
What is it, Trudy?

825
00:38:49,171 --> 00:38:51,562
I just got off the phone
with Meredith.

826
00:38:52,941 --> 00:38:56,776
She would prefer it if you
did not attend the funeral.

827
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:07,578
I understand.

828
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:10,373
Okay.
