180
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,341
Where did you find all of this?

181
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,427
I stole it.
A little bit from everyone seemed fair.

182
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,847
Don't be mad, Cory.

183
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,350
You need this stuff more than us,

184
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:28,104
and by the time anyone finds out,
you'll be long gone.

185
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,482
Hayley, come with us.

186
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,152
You're gonna be fine. Great.

187
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,029
You're all gonna be great.

188
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,156
And what about you?

189
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,034
I'll be here, safe.

190
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,329
-[sighs] Forever.
-[Taylor] I thought you left.

191
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,419
I was hoping if I waited long enough,
you might change your mind.

192
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:52,878
I didn't.

193
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,839
You?

194
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,218
Not this time.

195
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,512
Hayley, you've got chores.

196
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,807
-They can wait.
-They have. Go. Now.

197
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,566
Stay on the path and out of sight.
You'll be on the beach in no time.

198
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,526
It's a piece of cake.

199
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,653
[chuckles] A piece of cake. Yeah.

200
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,365
Well, I'll send help
as soon as we reach the shore.

201
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,950
[Taylor] <i>If </i>you reach the shore.

202
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,536
Help would've come if it was safe.

203
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,204
[Hayley scoffs]

204
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,875
-Hayley knows where we're heading, if--
-We won't.

205
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,252
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

206
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,379
I'm gonna miss ya.

207
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,382
Yeah.

208
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,842
Yeah, you too.

209
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,028
-You lookin' for Hayley?
-Oh. Hey, Shannon.

210
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,364
Yeah. She's supposed to be doing
her chores, but, of course, she isn't.

211
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,034
She and Rosa
went back to your place to get ready.

212
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,202
For what?

213
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,537
The falls. Everyone's going.

214
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,539
I told them to join us.

215
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,125
You should come too.

216
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,045
Uh, sure. Sounds good.

217
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,096
Too bad you couldn't find
the pilot to go with it. [laughs]

218
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,056
[both gasp]

219
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,892
Hayley?

220
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,895
I'd better go. Find me later.

221
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,107
Hi, Taylor. Bye, Taylor.

222
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,581
-Damn it, Hayley! You promised!
-I know I did, but before you get mad…

223
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,085
Before you get madder,
please just hear me out.

224
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,337
I found that
at the edge of the basin, and--

225
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,505
By the drop-off?

226
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,340
Yes, but I was careful.

227
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,676
Anyway, I know there's more out there.

228
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,427
Maybe even something
that could get us home.

229
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,263
What you're doing isn't
going to get us home.

230
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,931
It's going to get us killed.

231
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,059
You've been saying that for five years.

232
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,104
Nothing is going to happen to us
because nothing ever does.

233
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,982
I promised to keep you alive,
not entertained.

234
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,109
I'm sorry if that's not enough for you.

235
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,445
This is not living.
We're just waiting here to die.

236
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,030
We're waiting for Mom and Dad!

237
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,449
Mom and Dad are never coming back!

238
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,285
-They are!
-They're dead!

239
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,121

Kevin, move. Move!

250
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,319
Here, sit down.

251
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,613
I'm glad you came.

252
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,698
You doing okay?

253
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,699
Yeah.

254
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,702
Maybe. I, uh, I don't know.

255
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,870
Where's Hayley?

256
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,204
We had another fight.

257
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,789
She took off.

258
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,083
I was hoping she came here.

259
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,127
I saw her headed toward the rim.

260
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,712
She looked pretty upset.
