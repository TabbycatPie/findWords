[in Hebrew] This week...

3
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,956
my son became a man.

4
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,459
When am I a man?

5
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,876
Sh!

6
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:44,918
Aviram...

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,504
Please recite the blessing.

You can't catch me, Aviram...

15
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,239
Hey, get away from the street!

16
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,574
[laughing]

17
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,326
I'm too fast for you!

18
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,496
You're not a man, you're a turtle...

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,082
Aviram, no!

20
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,958
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

21
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,126
That's enough!

22
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,756
- We're just playing, Mamma!
- That's how it starts.

23
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,300
Hey!

24
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,969
Come back here!

00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:35,887
Aviram!

[Zev, in Hebrew] <i>Enjoying your holiday?</i>

31
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,447
Found me.

00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,283
<i>Of course we did.</i>

33
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,118
You're in deep shit, Avi.

34
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,537
<i>I'm used to it.</i>

35
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,416
You missed your hearing.

36
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,794
Is that why you're calling,
to tell me I'm out of a job?

37
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,962
I already knew that.

38
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,464
I'm calling you because I'm a good boss.

39
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,883
[chuckles]

40
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,552
Right.

41
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,388
I'm offering you a way back in.

42
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,099
<i>Why?</i>

43
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,728
You're in America. It's convenient.

<i>Ah.</i>

45
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,065
<i>It's a way to get your life back.</i>

46
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,819
Aviram?

47
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,579
I'm listening.

48
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,124
[in Arabic] The Palestinian people
have suffered for too long.

49
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,294
I call on everyone,
everywhere in the world...

50
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,590
I call on everyone...

51
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,636
[Imam] who recognizes Israel...

52
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,972
who recognizes Israel...

53
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,726
to also recognize
the State of Palestine...

54
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,021
to also recognize

55
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,356
the State of Palestine...

56
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,193
Why can't someone else do this?

57
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,654
If there was someone else,
I would not have asked you.

58
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,656
But I can't remember these words.

59
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,699
When I begin speaking, they disappear.

60
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,784
They will come.

61
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,119
You know them here...

62
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,288
now you have to know them here.

63
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,459
This is where faith comes from.

[speaks Arabic]

65
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,965
You must believe you can speak the words.

66
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,425
They will come when you need them.

67
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,970
God will provide.

68
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:26,391
Remember, my son, this not for you
or for me but for our people.

69
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,644
What you say is important
and will be heard by many.

70
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,021
Have faith...

71
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,442
[repeating statement]

72
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,029
who recognizes Israel...

[reciting prayer]

74
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,867

[continues reciting prayer]

76
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,790
[all repeat]
what is the matter with you

77
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,293
that, when you are told to go forth
in the cause of God,

78
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,253
[continues reciting]

79
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,463
[all repeat]
you adhere heavily to the earth?

80
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,049
[Zaid continues reciting]

81
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,719
Are you satisfied
with the life of this world

82
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,471
rather than the Hereafter?

83
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,686
[prayer continues]

84
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,944

[announcement on PA]

86
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,375
[Zelman] Eva!

87
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,213
Oh... What happened? Dad, are you okay?

88
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,132
- Yeah.
- You didn't say you were hurt.

89
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,176
- Are you hurt?
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

90
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,179
Why's he in a wheelchair?
Why are you in a chair?

91
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,638
- He's fine.
- No, they insisted on the wheels.

92
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,600
- Hey, how are you, sweetheart?
- I... I'm... I'm good.

93
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,394
- Can you walk?
- Yeah, of course I can walk.

94
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,314
I'm just supposed to help him
find his daughter.

95
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,083
- I'm assuming that's you?
- That's me. Yeah.

96
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,901
Okay. Well, he was a little confused.

97
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,320
So I thought you should know that.

98
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,490
I think the flight
might have been a little hard on him.

99
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,076
Well, I... I did, I got a bit upset.

100
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,161
He was caught up in...
in the flooding in Florida.

101
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,412
Oh, I'm fine.

102
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,082
By the time they got to him,
he was dehydrated.

103
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,876
It wouldn't be easy on anybody.
But you're fine now, though, right?

104
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,088
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Okay, Zelman, end of the line for you.

105
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,756
- No more free rides.
- All right.

106
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,508
[woman laughs]

107
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,010
You ready to go?

108
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,145
- [Anna] You hungry?
- No.

109
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,855
Thank you.

110
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,529
You should eat.

111
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,366
- I could call room service.
- I said I'm not hungry.

112
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,204
We're gonna have to talk about this
at some point.

113
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,876
Sticking your head in the sand
isn't the solution.

114
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,462
There is no solution. That's the problem.

115
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,548
That's why we have to talk about it.

116
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,594
You can't keep giving me
the silent treatment forever.

117
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,847
We have to find a way through this.

118
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,682
As a family.

119
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,059
[laughing] As a family. That's rich.

120
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,604
I understand
you're probably feeling left out.

121
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,566
It's not a feeling. It's a fact.
I was left out.

122
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,695
And you had the hide to accuse me
of not telling you things?

123
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,781
And now, I find this out?

124
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,200
If that's not hypocrisy, what is?

125
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,954
I wonder what else you don't tell me.

126
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,670
What do you really think of me, Anna?

127
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,089
Are you my partner?

128
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,552
Am I the husband you wanted,
or am I just a disappointment?

129
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,929
Clearly, I'm not someone you turn to.

130
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,266
That's not true, Felix.

131
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,186
I love you.

132
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,397
I just couldn't tell you.

133
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,484
I didn't know how.

134
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,571
I knew it would break your heart.

135
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,365
- And it was what Rebecca needed.
- I'm her father!

136
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,034
I know what she needs.

137
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,787
You don't have a right
to make that decision without me.

138
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,373
- You would have said no.
- Of course I would have said no.

139
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,209
We have beliefs!

140
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,795
And they don't include abortions
for young girls.

141
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,882
Or don't you believe that?

142
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,467
[sighs]

143
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,302
What <i>do </i>you believe, Anna?

144
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,139
Do you even believe in God?

145
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,271
I don't believe Rebecca
stuck in Dilley, Texas

146
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,191
as a teen mom for the rest of her life
was an option.

147
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,778
And I wasn't gonna let that
happen to her.

148
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,409
That explains a lot.

149
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,579
What is that supposed to mean?

150
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,542
I'm taking control. That's what it means.

151
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,594
[laughing]

152
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,013
[car door shuts]

153
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,058
Daddy!

154
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,185
[laughs]

155
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,022
- Daddy!
- Oh, I missed you so much!

156
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,108
- Aah!
- I missed you too, Daddy.

157
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,111
Look at you.

158
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,571
- Aww.
- [dog barks]

159
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,407
Max! Oh, I missed you so much!

160
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,827
She seems so much better, doesn't she?

161
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,870
[Raeah] How've you been?

162
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,582
That's what happens
when you go off chemo, Staci.

163
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,585
[he sighs]

164
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,824
Hey, Dad.

165
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,910
Dad.

166
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,997
What are you doing?

167
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,582
- I'm packing.
- Wh...

168
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,877
- Why are you packing?
- Um...

169
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,047
- I've got a plane to catch.
- What?

170
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,467
I got a plane to catch.
I don't want to be late.

171
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,094
You've already caught the plane, Dad.
You're here.

172
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,723
Already caught the plane?

173
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,474
Yes.

174
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,435
We just got here.

175
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,396
Uh... was that today?

176
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,774
Yes, today.

177
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,444
You should be unpacking.

178
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,656
Remember, you're gonna stay with me
for a while?

179
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,204
- [sighs]
- This is gonna be your room.

180
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,832
I'll help you settle in,
and then I'm gonna get to work.

181
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,626
Uh... Oh! Ah! Yeah! Yeah.

182
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,879
Of course. [laughs] I'm gonna be
staying here with you for a while.

183
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,132
There was that flood back home.

184
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,468
Uh, I must...

185
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,346
be tireder than I thought I was.

186
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,225
And certainly not the traveler
that I used to be.

187
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,810
You gonna be okay?

188
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,063
Oh, yeah, sure. I'm fine, honey.

189
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Fine.

190
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,901
[he sighs]

191
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,506
- [woman] Good afternoon.
- Hi.

192
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,091
- Will that be all?
- Thank you.

193
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,593
- Would you like to charge it to your bill?
- I'll pay cash.

194
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,590
[Ed] Have to admit, Felix,
I'm surprised to see you.

195
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,883
Ed.

196
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,387
Have a seat.

197
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,934
Well...
I've thought a lot about what you said.

198
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:53,022
About harnessing all that attention,
giving it a focus.

199
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,567
You're not leaving it up to God anymore?

200
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,779
This can still all be
a part of God's plan.

201
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,240
He looks for us to enact his will, right?

202
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,118
Oh, you think you know God's will?

203
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,456
Look, Ed, you wanted in,
now I'm giving you an in.

204
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,791
It's as simple as that.

205
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,503
You will triple your viewership, at least.

206
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,174
Are you telling me you don't want
your message to reach more people?

207
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,093
You can reach out past this country.

208
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:27,556
You can reach the world, Ed.
The Messiah on your own TV show.

209
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,268
But if he's not who you say he is...

210
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,146
Well, that's a matter of faith, Ed,

211
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,816
but no one's gonna blame you
for wanting to believe.

212
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,402
Is this his idea or yours?

213
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,529
It's mine.

214
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,742
And he's agreed?

215
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,245
Yes.

216
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,956
Russia.

217
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,845
Same.

218
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,954
[woman] <i>Comms sector.</i>

219
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,081
- Yeah, I need a trace.
<i>- What source?</i>

220
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,625
Phone number, please.

221
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,629
709-597-449-61.

222
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,300
[man] Over the past 36 hours,
the Russians have mobilized

223
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,219
an estimated 12,000 troops
into the Red Zone.

224
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,640
They can hit targets
inside Latvia right now.

225
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,853
It's a blatant provocation, sir.
If we don't move, they'll feel emboldened.

226
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,274
Well... you call it a provocation,

227
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,527
but we increased our fleet
in the Baltic first, didn't we?

228
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,779
On your orders, sir.

229
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,489
You drew the line.

230
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,241
You can't back away from that.
It makes you look weak.

231
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,327
This demands a response.

232
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,829
We can't afford another Syria.

233
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,377
Sir?

234
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,007
[Collier] Mr. President?

235
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,803
[treadmill whirring]

236
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,188
Keeping fit?

237
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,317
This way, uh... I can walk,
and they know where I am.

238
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,402
Mm.

239
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,114
Who <i>are </i>you?

240
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,201
That's the big question, isn't it?

241
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,204
Payam Golshiri.

242
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,167
Thirty-six, Iranian, you spent
seven months in a psychiatric hospital

243
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,253
diagnosed with delusional disorder.

244
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,132
A "messiah complex,"
that's what the doctors called it.

245
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,176
I don't know if that's ironic or just sad.

246
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:56,390
Maybe you're a charlatan like your uncle,
or maybe you believe what you're saying.

247
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,727
Whichever way you cut it,
you're being dishonest,

248
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,936
either with yourself or everyone else.

249
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,187
[beeping]

250
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,820
The only other option is
you're being taken advantage of,

251
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,781
and if someone is running you,
Payam, I will find out.

252
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,825
"Running" me?

253
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,744
Of all the universities in the US,

254
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,497
you chose Williams,
a tiny college in Massachusetts.

255
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,335
An unusual choice,
unless you know about Oscar Wallace.

256
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,048
Oscar has a rare mind.

257
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,133
So you do know him.

258
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,344
As you say, it was a small campus.

259
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,432
To know his mind is to know him well.

260
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,142
We shared a lot.

261
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,020
Have you remained in touch with him?

262
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,313
He's a friend.

263
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,277
Willfully communicating with
a known terrorist is a federal offense.

264
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,448
Are you going to arrest me?

265
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,576
Eventually. You can count on that.

266
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,996
- You are so strong in your convictions.
- Yes, I am.

267
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082
I see you.

268
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,334
And I'm coming to get you.

269
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,760
Hey, you're that TV lady.

270
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,680
The news lady from TV. I recognize you.

271
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,016
Christine Keneally.

272
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,142
Mm... Mm.

273
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,226
Miriam.

274
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,936
Miriam.

275
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,273
Uh... you're the preacher's wife, right?

276
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,400
You know me?

277
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,574
[knocking at door]

278
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,621
[knocking]

279
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,674
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

280
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,717
- You're not.
- Can we talk?

281
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,106
I've been praying.

282
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,150
For answers.

283
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,234
And...

284
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,029
there's a lot I still don't understand.

285
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,074
I realized one thing.

286
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,705
I've always assumed that because
I come from humble beginnings,

287
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,456
I must be a humble man.

288
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,957
But...

289
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,130
I've learned that my lesson
is in humility.

290
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,883
I'm God's servant.

291
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,510
And therefore, I'm your servant.

292
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,219
And, um...

293
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,682
I want to serve you the best way I can.

294
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,269
And how is that?

295
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,943
I realize that I'm in a, uh...

296
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,695
unique position.

297
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,282
I can arrange for you to be
on my father-in-law's television show.

298
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:05,746
It'll be a safe forum for you to speak
to millions of people at one time.

299
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,956
The media can't twist your words.

300
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,335
It's just you, speaking to people
in their homes.

301
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:17,299
A message straight from you,
directly to an audience of millions.

302
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,305
It's what God wants. I know it.
Let me do this for you, please.

303
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,726
Please.

304
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,272
Okay.

305
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,278
But I want Rebecca to be there.

306
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,281
Of course.

307
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,788
[Miriam] I have to be honest with you.
I don't get it. I really don't.

308
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Get what?

309
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,084
You and your husband calling him Jesus.

310
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,168
[chuckles]

311
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,544
We don't call him Jesus.

312
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,965
- What do you call him?
- Don't ask me.

313
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,425
Why not? Why shouldn't I ask you?

314
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,929
You know...

315
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,139
What?

316
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,394
Off the record?

317
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,980
Mm-hm.

318
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,692
Everything changed when he came.

319
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,652
Everything.

320
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,361
What do you mean?

321
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,364
My husband won't talk to me.

322
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,201
My daughter is turning into somebody
I don't recognize.

323
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,079
They believe they're chosen.

324
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,873
They're falling all over themselves

325
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,918
for this stranger from a strange land.

326
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,298
Nothin' good has come from any of this
since he showed up.

327
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,342
[sighs] So...

328
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,472
You want to know
who I think he really is?

329
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,682
I do.

330
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,476
I don't know who he is.

331
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,687
Or what he wants.

332
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,397
But...

333
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,776
I do know one thing for certain.

334
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,737
What's that?

335
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,865
He's not the fucking messiah.

336
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,870
[cicadas chirping]

337
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,123
[Jonah] "'Allow me to introduce myself.

338
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,958
My name is Tumnus.

339
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,587
'I'm very pleased to meet you,
Mr. Tumnus, ' said Lucy."

340
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,839
"Mr. Tumnus" is a funny name.

341
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,090
It sure is.

342
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,888
"'And may I ask, O Lucy, daughter of Eve, '

343
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,391
said Mr. Tumnus,
'how have you come to Narnia?'

344
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,061
'Narnia? What's that?' said Lucy.

345
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,357
'Well, this is the land of Narnia, '
said the faun.

346
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,277
'Where we are now,
all that lies between the lamppost

347
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,530
and the great castle of Cair Paravel
on the Eastern Sea.'”

348
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,370
[he sighs]

349
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,955
Did she fall asleep? [chuckles]

350
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,624
Out like a light.

351
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,960
She sure loves that book.

352
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,672
You've read it to her
a thousand times already.

353
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,800
[he sighs]

354
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,427
It's good to be back home.

355
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,762
You know?

356
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,516
We really missed you.

357
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,939
Saying that
doesn't make everything better, Staci.

358
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,857
No, I... I know it doesn't.

359
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,568
But it's true.

360
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,114
[sighs] You took our daughter
without even telling me.

361
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,157
In what universe do you think that's okay?

362
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,450
I'm sorry, Jonah.

363
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,036
If I'd have told you,
you would've stopped us.

364
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,415
I couldn't watch her suffer
through chemo again.

365
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,918
- I couldn't do it.
- We spoke about this.

366
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:44,172
- We decided that she would do another...
- I couldn't do it again. Not this time.

367
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,552
I had to! If there was... a chance,

368
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,805
even the tiniest chance
that he could help her, I had to take it.

369
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,475
You have to understand,
I did this because I love her.

370
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,019
I love you, Staci,
and I can forgive you for a lot,

371
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,688
but I can't for this.

372
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,523
Not for risking her life.

373
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,443
What are you saying?

374
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm filing for divorce.

375
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,657
I can't trust you with her anymore.

376
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,493
Jonah, please.

377
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,829
I want sole custody of Raeah.

378
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,246
No...

379
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,623
Jonah!

380
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,792
- [jingle plays]
- [man] <i>The Messiah.</i>

381
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,794
<i>Sunday evening, one night only.</i>

382
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,922
[man 2] <i>Chicago's Mayor Pinkerton

383
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,091

384
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,259
[Eva] Shit.

385
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,511
How about pasta?

386
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,681
<i>...police reinforcements

387
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,099

388
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,851
<i>...many cities this week.</i>

389
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:42,147
Does your work have anything to do
with this Messiah man that's on TV?

390
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,027
Yeah, it does, but...
don't worry about it.

391
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,071
I've been having funny feelings lately.

392
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,575
- Yeah?
- Funny in a good way.

393
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,245
But I can't say
that I've ever had them before.

394
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,414
It's like...

395
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,627
I'm connected to things.

396
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,963
I look at the moon...

397
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,509
and I don't see the moon anymore.

398
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,262
I feel it.

399
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,724
- Things are happening, Eva.
- [rattling]

400
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,308
What things?

401
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,103
Did I tell you about the fish?

402
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,235
Uh... what fish?

403
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,487
The fish before the flood.

404
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,281
It's all connected.

405
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,326
Like this man.

406
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,202
This...

407
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,828
Messiah.

408
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,623
[sighs]

409
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,876
- He's not the messiah, Dad.
- Listen.

410
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,754
I've never been really religious,
you know,

411
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,673
or felt close to God,

412
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,841
but I have been watching the sunrise,

413
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,177
and sometimes, it just...

414
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,346
uh... it...

415
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:57,931
fills me.

416
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,395
- [sighs]
- What is it, honey?

417
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,729
[sighs]

418
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,856
You're just not usually like this.

419
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,400
Am I upsetting you?

420
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Sort of.

421
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,572
Eva...

422
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,866
Your mom, she believed.

423
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,160
Now, I never did,

424
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,412
but she believed.

425
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,582
She had six miscarriages,
but she never gave up

426
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,543
because she knew that you were out there.

427
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,045
[sighs]

428
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,589
She wanted you.

429
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,340
She had hope.

430
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,427
And she believed
that she was meant to have a child.

431
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:40,348
And she knew that you were out there
waiting for us to find you.

432
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,269
You were God's gift.

433
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,356
Okay, Dad.

434
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,318
- That's what she used to say.
- I don't wanna talk about this.

435
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,196
You brought your mom and me
such... ah, happiness.

436
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,199
Stop talking about Mom, now, please.

437
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,578
Well, not a day goes by
that I don't miss her.

438
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,998
I said I don't want to talk about Mom.

439
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,877
She had hope. I'm just...
I'm just saying. And so did you.

440
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,421
I lost the baby, Dad.

441
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,300
There's no more chances.

442
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,383
Uh...

443
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,928
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

444
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,263
Dad, don't.

445
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,431
Just, please.

446
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,265
Don't.

447
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,729
I'm your father, Eva.

448
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,358
- I'm... here for you.
- Dad, stop. Don't talk about Mom...

449
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,360
like you loved her.

450
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,405
We don't get to rewrite history, Dad.

451
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,491
Some things
you just can't go back and change.

452
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:43,161
Right? So there's no hope.
Don't talk to me about hope.

453
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,247
And whether you meant to or not,
you brought me up to be just like you.

454
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,334
Pragmatic and selfish.
And you weren't there for Mom.

455
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,545
And I wasn't there for Ben.

456
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,298
So don't talk to me about hope,

457
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,885
or babies, or Mom,
or the goddamn messiah.

458
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,513

[Rebecca] She's drunk.

470
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,977
Yeah, seems so.

471
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,857
She's, uh...
havin' a hard time with all this.

472
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,946
I was gonna try and get her undressed
but decided to let her sleep.

00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,031
[sighs]

474
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,407
That's probably best.

475
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,037
Good night.

476
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,711
He's gonna go on Grandpa's show.

477
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,712
Who?

478
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,757
The Savior.

479
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,928
He wants you there... to be with him.

480
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,850
Okay.

00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,366
[Rebecca sighs]

482
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,172
How old's your daughter?

483
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,051
Four.

484
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,973
Where's your husband?

485
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,810
He's dead.

486
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,735
- Was he like us?
- No.

487
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,155
He was nothing like us.

488
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,328
We were an unlikely match,
and not an easy one.

489
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,621
No one...

490
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,082
could've said how it would end up.

491
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,627
There's no guarantee
of a happily ever after.

492
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,381
It just ended the way it did.

493
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,434
My wife cheated on me.

494
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,564
Look at us.

495
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,153
You're right,
we're as fucked up as each other.

496
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,455
This was a mistake.

what is the matter with you

that, when you are told to go forth
in the cause of God,

506
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:34,262
- you adhere heavily to the earth?
- [repeats]

507
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,435
Are you satisfied
with the life of this world

508

rather than the Hereafter?

509
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,654
Do you have doubt, Samer?

510
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,702
I believe with all my heart.

511
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,787
I'm proud of you.

512
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,623
You are a true disciple of God.

<i>This is Officer Eva Geller

Hello, Officer Geller,
nice to make your acquaintance.

527
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,140
Now, if I could be so bold...
how did you find this number?

528
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,017
A friend of yours gave it to me.

529
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,144
Payam Golshiri.

<i>You've been trading calls with him,</i>

531
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,523
<i>and I'd like to know
what those calls are about.</i>

532
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,693
They were of a personal nature.

533
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,069
Just a little chitchat?

534
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:59,699

there is no plan between us.

I know you're a terrorist, and somehow
you've got Golshiri under your spell.

550
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,541
Here. I'm going to help you because
you were clever enough to find me.

They're his words.
Wallace is his disciple.

And he's been communicating
with Wallace. I have his phone records.

585

You took unauthorized action
to make contact with a known terrorist.

I wasn't sure it was going to be him.

587

So you took action on something
you weren't sure about?

Isn't this what Collier asked for?
Actionable intelligence?

589
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,473
Then you put it in your report
and you submit it.

What, so we can hand it over to the FBI?
What action's going to be taken?

591

We're not a law enforcement agency, Eva.
That's not our concern.
