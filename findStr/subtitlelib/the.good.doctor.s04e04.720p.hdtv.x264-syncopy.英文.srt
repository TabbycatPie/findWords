18
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,660
Move from Bhujangasana

19
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,950
into Adho Mukha Svanasana.

20
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,500
And hold that.

21
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,370
Do you like this?

22
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm not sure.

23
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,050
I like that you like it.

24
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,510
Time for work!

25
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,220
Guess we'll finish Vinyasa flow...

26
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,680
next time I come over.

27
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,390
You shouldn't come over anymore.

28
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,730
You should move in.

29
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,400
Things are different now.

30
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,190
You lived here before. What's different?

31
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,360
Everything is different.

32
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,860
Then, we were roomies, pals, buddies,

33
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,160
and now we're... a real thing.

34
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,000
A better thing, for sure, but also more complicated.

35
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,010
We're the same people in the same place

36
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,040
doing the same things.

37
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,460
It's bigger than that, Shaun.

38
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,960
I hope it is. I...

39
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,220
Living together means more commitment, more trust.

40
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,800
And I don't think we're quite there yet.

41
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,770
You don't trust me?

42
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,730
No, I do. It's just...

43
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,810
I need a bit more.

44
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,990
Copernicus1543
Copernicus1543.

45
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,460
It's my banking password.

46
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,050
Yes! I got you!

47
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,220
- No! - Bow to your queen.

48
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,930
- No, bitch! No! - Yes!

49
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,230
Where did you find the 10,000 hours that you put into that?

50
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,650
I like filling my evenings

51
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,860
with numbing mindlessness.

52
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,740
Morgan needs me to go in ASAP.

53
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,620
You figure she shouldn't page you?

54
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,160
She can handle it on her own

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,370
because she used to be a surgical resident?

56
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,790
Be the bigger person.

57
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,750
It's an ingrown hair.

58
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,550
Definitely an ingrown hair.

59
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,880
Unfortunately, the ingrown hair

60
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,840
caused an abscess that needs to be lanced.

61
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,140
By a surgeon.

62
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,890
Please give this man the VIP treatment.

63
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,140
I have another case to attend to, but don't worry.

64
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,270
I'll be checking in.

65
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,980
Such a nice lady.

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,740
So, how shall we proceed?

67
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,030
I'm going with "drain the abscess and dress the wound."

68
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,700
Set it up.

69
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,290
Maybe we should do a biopsy?

70
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,750
Well, it could be a cutaneous pili migrans

71
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,420
or have a deep sinus tract

72
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,380
or a creeping eruption caused by a parasitic disease.

73
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,380
Give him the VIP treatment.

74
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,180
Abdominal pain can be scary when you're pregnant.

75
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,260
But I wouldn't worry. You have two rambunctious boys.

76
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,430
I know. It's like a cage match in here.

77
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,180
Shaun, where's your first-year resident?

78
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,690
I have two first-year residents,

79
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,190
but I don't want to teach them.

80
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,520
They're very distracting.

81
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,940
You have a dizygotic, dichorionic,

82
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,690
diamniotic pregnancy.

83
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,440
It just means your twins are fraternal

84
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,200
and in separate amniotic sacs.

85
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,620
First-years aren't distractions. They're godsends.

86
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,660
She has edema.

87
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,160
Not surprising for someone who's 26 weeks pregnant.

88
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,830
They'll do anything you want.

89
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,370
Scut work, follow-ups, coffee runs...

90
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,460
- I don't like coffee. - ...laundry, apple runs.

91
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,670
I already did that.

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,260
- What was her BP? - Normal.

93
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,130
BP's no longer normal. She's hypertensive.

94
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,180
What does that mean, Dr. Murray?

95
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,680
Is your vision blurred?

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,180
A bit. I'm tired.

97
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,650
Sounds like preeclampsia.

98
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,150
If we don't get your BP down ASAP,

99
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,690
you could lose your pregnancy.

102
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,910
We need to start you on anti-hypertensive meds,

103
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,250
but your edema makes it difficult to place an IV,

104
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,170
so we need to run a central line.

105
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,880
Dr. Jackson?

106
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,940
Mind if I give a hand, Dr. Murphy?

107
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,370
Is there anyone you want us to call?

108
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,250
My boyfriend decided his obligations ended

109
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,090
at offering to pay for an abortion.

110
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,430
Soft man in a hard world.

111
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,300
Fetal heart rate's dropping.

112
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,850
But only one of them.

113
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,600
Did you have another birth?

114
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,650
- No. - Any pregnancy?

115
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,940
Miscarriage, abortion, stillbirth?

116
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,990
I had an abortion when I was 15.

117
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,070
It's not preeclampsia.

118
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,490
One fetus is Rh-positive,

119
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,030
and the mother is Rh-negative,

120
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,080
and her body is perceiving him as a threat

121
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
and attacking him with antibodies.

122
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,830
Antibodies she could only have

123
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,830
if she had an earlier pregnancy.

124
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,550
My body is trying to kill one of my babies?

125
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,960
Yes.

126
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,390
Waiting on Billy's biopsy results?

127
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,470
To confirm an ingrown hair?

128
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,230
You grew up in a Hasidic family, right?

129
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,730
How are they handling you being a doctor?

130
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,570
I haven't spoken to them in

131
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,700
four years, except one sister.

132
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,580
I chose not to live by their rules. I...

133
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,000
I knew the consequences.

134
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,540
My dad was a real estate agent,

135
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,750
obsessed with two completely unrelated things,

136
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,460
teeth and taxes.

137
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,880
Thought I'd spend the rest of my life selling condos.

138
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,590
Now I'm a surfin' surgeon,

139
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,140
but I still floss three times a day

140
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,100
and pay my installments four times a year.

141
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
So, what's my dental floss?

142
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,850
Fire and brimstone.

143
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,650
Actually, that is from the New Testament.

144
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,150
I don't even know what brimstone is.

145
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,610
I meant you fear disaster.

146
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,450
Your people's history is kind of filled with it.

147
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,290
Billy has cancer.

148
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,590
How are your first-years doing?

149
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,300
Jordan talks too much,

150
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,010
and Olivia talks too little.

151
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,560
And Olivia does not know where the jugular vein is.

152
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,060
You see her resume?

153
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,770
Her grades and USMLE scores were nearly perfect.

154
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,440
So, if it's not a lack of knowledge,

155
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,520
what do you think it is?

156
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,320
I think Olivia has the potential to be an exemplary doctor

157
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,570
if you push her, give her a little extra attention.

158
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,160
Isn't that unfair to Jordan?

159
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,950
Was it unfair to the applicant who didn't get your position

160
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,290
because Dr. Glassman

161
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,790
thought that you needed some extra attention?

162
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,960
Olivia just doesn't like being in the spotlight. That's all.

163
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,590
Olivia's resume

164
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,130
didn't say anything about not liking the spotlight.

165
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,010
Exactly.

166
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,840
Don't trust resumes.

167
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,100
Locate jugular vein.

168
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,440
Insert needle.

169
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,440
Get a venous blush.

170
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,230
Remove syringe, leaving needle in,

171
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,940
- then thread... - Thread wire into needle.

172
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,070
Remove needle.

173
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Scalpel to skin,

174
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,200
while being aware of a persistent left-sided

175
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,210
superior vena cava placement,

176
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,080
present in 4% of those with congenital heart disease.

177
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,670
Remove wire.

178
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,920
Suture in line to skin.

179
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,840
And done.

180
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,720
I guess you were nervous before.

181
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,970
Didn't you have first-case jitters?

182
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,060
No.

183
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,230
The sick twin has gone into severe distress.

184
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,490
You have amelanotic melanoma.

185
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,580
Skin cancer.

186
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,040
But there's good news.

187
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,120
We should be able to remove all of it.

188
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,620
We can do it today.

189
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,040
Sorry. Car trouble.

190
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,880
Hi, Dr. Park. Just telling Billy about his cancer.

191
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,470
I got a great mechanic for you.

192
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,220
If you tell her Billy sent you,

193
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,430
she'll give you a friends-and-family.

194
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,020
Okay. Thanks for that.

195
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,640
You have an amazing attitude.

196
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,100
You know, my wife used to tease me about that.

197
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,230
She died three years ago.

198
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,110
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,200
You know, on our second date, I got a flat.

200
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,070
Now, I think she thought I was gonna curse,

201
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,660
but all I could say was,

202
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,540
"Good timing. Costco's got a sale on tires."

203
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,460
It's Addy's Auto, Los Gatos and Gateway.

204
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,470
We are through the uterine wall.

205
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,930
Dr. Jackson, what's our next step?

206
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,180
Advance through the trocar

207
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,890
15 millimeters beyond the tip

208
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,650
until the opening of the distal basket

209
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,860
can be confirmed by ultrasound.

210
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,950
Exactly.

211
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,160
What would you like me to advance, Dr. Jackson?

212
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,830
Oh. Yes. Right.

213
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,330
Obviously, you would be advancing

214
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,500
the double basket rocket catheter, not this.

215
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:37,920
Sorry.

216
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,250
Not your fault.

217
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
If a junior resident is ill-prepared,

218
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,460
that's on the senior resident.

219
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,220
How is it fair that I get blamed for a first-year's mistake,

220
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,430
and how can I help that person

221
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,230
without being unfair to the other one?

222
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,560
And how fair was the preferential treatment that you gave me?

223
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,730
And how fair was it to the other first-year resident,

224
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,690
who didn't get placed because you helped me?

225
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,990
And how fair was...

226
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,240
Put the list down.

227
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,910
Only four questions at a time. That's my limit.

228
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,660
What kind of mistake?

229
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,830
Even though I went over the procedure with Olivia,

230
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,880
she still gave Dr. Andrews the pusher rod

231
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,460
when he needed the rocket catheter,

232
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,460
and he said it was my fault.

233
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,590
It was your fault.

234
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,260
You got to help her a little more.

235
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,340
That is not fair to Jordan.

236
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,800
What does fairness have to do with it?

237
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,220
It's not about equality.

238
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,680
It's about figuring out what each person needs

239
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,730
and then teaching them how to get it.

240
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,150
How do I know what they need?

241
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,770
Well, you've taught them medicine, right?

242
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,690
So, uh, maybe it's something else.

243
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,990
Maybe it's an emotional issue.

244
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,570
Well, then I definitely can't give them what they need.

245
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,320
You can ask them.

246
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,080
About their emotions?

247
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,580
Yeah, ask them how they feel.

248
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,080
I don't care how they feel.

249
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,170
That's the beauty of it. You don't have to care.

250
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,590
You just have to ask them how they really feel.

251
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,050
Then they start talking.

252
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,380
And some people love to talk.

253
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,110
Have you been working out?

254
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,440
I could only find mediums.

255
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,990
You know how many sets of large scrubs I had to hide?

256
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,030
Thirty-one.

257
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,830
Injecting dye.

258
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,290
BP's dropping. Diffuse skin flushing.

259
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,420
He's in anaphylactic shock.

260
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,720
He's allergic to the dye. Ten cc epinephrine.

261
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,140
BP barely measurable. We should intubate.

262
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,390
Initiate CPR.

263
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,890
You should cannulate his femoral vein

264
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,390
to give pressers and volume.

265
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,230
Let's intubate and cannulate.

266
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,360
His jugular's distended.

267
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,070
Maybe he has cardiac tamponade from a pericardial effusion.

268
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,490
He might need open-heart surgery.

269
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,660
Worst-case scenario worked out for you the first time.

270
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,160
Really think lightning's gonna strike twice?

271
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,370
Maybe not, but I'm still

272
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,620
not gonna stand on a hill in a thunderstorm.

273
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,870
Let's call Lim.

274
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,870
Prep the patient for a pericardiotomy.

275
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,630
Two for two.

276
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,180
Okay, you can't do yoga at work.

277
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,430
I do it at home. What's the difference?

278
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,480
Work behavior is not the same as home behavior.

279
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,230
So you're saying context matters.

280
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,150
Of course.

281
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,450
Same way that two roommates living together

282
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,410
is different from a couple living together.

283
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,830
Same people, same place, different context.

284
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,880
Once our feelings change, everything changes.

285
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,170
I still feel the same way when I'm with you.

286
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,050
Happy.

287
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,440
Kenzie's BP and edema have improved.

288
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,190
The fetus's echo shows improved heart function.

289
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,860
Catheter's working.

290
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,410
How do you feel?

291
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,030
Okay.

292
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,960
How do you really feel?

293
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,130
Really okay?

294
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
You want to know why I'm so nervous all the time?

295
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,180
I don't know.

296
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,310
I've always been very terrified of firsts.

297
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,320
First day of school, camp, church,

298
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,230
all the new faces watching me,

299
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,110
just waiting for me to screw up.

300
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,200
First day of fifth grade,

301
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,820
when Mrs. Deloitte asked me what 6 times 9 was,

302
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,950
I told the whole class it was 45.

303
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,410
Yeah, I can still hear them laughing at me.

304
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,630
And two nights ago, I dreamt I was standing

305
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,250
in front of Mrs. Deloitte's class again.

306
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,710
Couldn't wait to wake up.

307
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,460
But when I did,

308
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,090
I realized that if I got the answer wrong today,

309
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,680
no one will laugh, but someone may die.

310
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,060
The kids laughed at me, too.

311
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,230
Even though I knew 6 times 9 was 54.

312
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,440
One of the amniotic sacs ruptured.

313
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,690
The strong twin's.

314
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,790
It's metastasized to his liver.

315
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,450
So, what do we do?

316
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,170
Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation.

317
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,920
Short recovery time, but a significant chance his cancer returns.

318
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,050
Care to rebut?

319
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,880
I think we should consider a hepatic lobectomy

320
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,550
and lymph node dissection.

321
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,140
Remove the affected area of the liver,

322
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,270
all the surrounding tissue, and every swollen node we find.

323
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,020
And that's the aggressive approach.

324
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,270
Longer recovery time, high risk of complications,

325
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,440
and, uh,

326
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,480
admittedly, the best shot at beating the cancer.

327
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,110
By "complications," you mean a barely functioning liver,

328
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,610
a persistent threat of fatal bleeds, and chronic pain.

329
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,860
As surgeons, you can gut him,

330
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,910
but as his primary doctor, I have to find the balance

331
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,870
between longevity and quality of life.

332
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,370
Last week, you were trying to perform surgery from the gallery,

333
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,120
and now you hate surgeons.

334
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,420
Pick a side.

335
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,500
A piecemeal approach is not going to work with Billy.

336
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,590
Every time we try to solve a problem,

337
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,920
we discover another one.

338
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,800
You may have left your religion in Brooklyn,

339
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,010
but you keep looking for meaning in random events.

340
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,260
The dice have no memory.

341
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,390
I'm not looking for meaning. I'm looking for patterns.

342
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,310
Maybe he's got some underlying condition.

343
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,730
I agree with Asher.

344
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,060
The dice have no memory, but they can be loaded.

345
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,480
So... safe and seriously compromised

346
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,570
or aggressive and possibly dead?

347
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,200
Your case, Dr. Browne.

348
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,870
Your call.

349
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,710
How you feeling?

350
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,800
You sacrificed a lot.

351
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,420
Your hands, your career.

352
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,510
And you're taking it out on me and Claire

353
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,970
and the whole surgical profession.

354
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,100
I get it. It hurts.

355
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,600
You're pathetic.

356
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,180
You're worried about me because I'll never be a surgeon?

357
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,140
Boo-hoo.

358
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,850
You're worried about me because I took pleasure

359
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,440
in screwing with you and Claire?

360
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,900
That's who I am.

361
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,110
The question is, who are you?

362
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,940
You don't show up late with lame-ass excuses,

363
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,070
and when you get dissed, you diss back, so...

364
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,360
How are you feeling?

365
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,990
Forget I asked.

366
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,790
He's lost most of his amniotic fluid.

367
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,750
Won't last very long in utero.

368
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,750
In helping the weak, we hurt the strong.

369
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,130
C-section?

370
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,720
If we do a C-section to save the strong baby,

371
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,340
there's a 90% chance the weak baby will die.

372
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,640
But if we do an amnioinfusion to save the weak baby,

373
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,020
there's an 85% chance that strong baby will die.

374
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,350
It's the better option.

375
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,940
5% to decide which baby lives?

376
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,070
Kenzie's body has already made that choice.

377
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,200
If there's a strong baby and a weak baby,

378
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,610
it's pretty clear which one we save.

379
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,990
Survival of the fittest.

380
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,040
Sorry. It's just...

381
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,080
That's not really what we're about, is it,

382
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,870
as a civilization?

383
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,460
Aren't the strong morally obligated to help the weak?

384
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,550
And if they don't, isn't everybody ultimately worse off?

385
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,300
Neither baby has to die.

386
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,010
Delayed interval delivery.

387
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,970
We induce labor, deliver the strong twin,

388
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,430
then stop the labor to keep the weak twin in utero

389
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,770
until his lungs mature.

390
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,770
The chances of stopping labor are very slim.

391
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,360
That's true. There's about a 70% chance

392
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,900
that both babies would die.

393
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,030
Which makes it the worst possible choice.

394
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,860
We need to ask Kenzie.

395
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,870
No, we don't.

396
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,370
Once she hears there's the slightest chance

397
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,790
of saving both babies,

398
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,000
she won't listen to any alternatives.

399
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,620
Statistically, it's a terrible option.

400
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,710
But it is an option.

401
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,810
No. No, you can't seriously be asking me this.

402
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,690
I know that this is something no mother should ever have to decide.

403
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,900
There are no good options here,

404
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,310
but there is one that'll most likely make you the mother

405
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,570
of a healthy baby boy.

406
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,030
Okay.

407
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,500
Prep for an amnioinfusion...

408
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,710
Have you named them?

409
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,290
Dr. Allen.

410
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,760
Braydon and...

411
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,180
Landon.

412
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,020
No. No, I can't do this.

413
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,560
You have to save both of them.

414
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,360
We're at the tumor.

415
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,160
Unipolar ablation probe?

416
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,780
Pretty cool to think that we diagnosed Billy

417
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,450
with metastatic melanoma on Tuesday

418
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,990
and send him home on a Thursday.

419
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,830
Well, let's wait till Friday to congratulate ourselves.

420
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,680
Current at 480 hertz, please.

421
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,810
Wait.

422
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,380
We got a leak. Bile duct.

423
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,170
Suction, suture, linear stapler, stat.

424
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,870
I believe she made the right choice.

425
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,250
She made a choice any mother would make

426
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,520
because the alternative is unthinkable.

427
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,970
Isn't that exactly what made it the right choice?

428
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,790
She has to live with it.

429
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,810
The safe choice is not always the best choice.

430
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,260
If it were, I'd be on an army base in Germany,

431
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,010
married to 1st Lieutenant Dwayne Buckman.

432
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,490
Dr. Andrews, you wanted to see me?

433
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,280
Yes, Dr. Jackson. Please come in.

434
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,110
"Dr. Jackson."

435
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,410
I cannot say those two words without grinning!

436
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,160
I know.

437
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,520
So?

438
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,180
Uh, just checking in with you, Livy.

439
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,270
Like you do with all your first-years?

440
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,180
You wanted hands off.

441
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,490
You're getting hands off.

442
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,860
But I can still say hi to my niece.

443
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,850
It looks like you're settling in pretty well.

444
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,680
No, the way you spoke up yesterday...

445
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,970
I mean, that's a tough case, tough crowd,

446
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,130
but you held your own.

447
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,830
I'm getting there.

448
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,270
Dr. Murphy's been very supportive.

449
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,880
Murphy? Yeah, I'm glad to hear it.

450
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,650
I'm sure he sees your potential.

451
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,400
But if you need anything, you...

452
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,070
...ask anyone but me.

453
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,960
Very hands off.

454
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,300
Shaun, this is not an argument

455
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,090
I ever thought I'd have to have with a boyfriend,

456
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,710
whether moving in together matters.

457
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,530
It so obviously does. It so obviously changes everything.

458
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,470
But,

459
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,900
one of the reasons I'm in this relationship

460
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,990
is because of that.

461
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,500
You are different.

462
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,610
And when I think about us, say, a year from now,

463
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,530
I can't imagine us not living together.

464
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,970
So, if it's inevitable...

465
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,240
Shaun,

466
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,520
I am moving in with you.

467
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,080
Does that mean

468
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,300
you think we have enough commitment and trust?

469
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,790
Honestly...

470
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,540
I'm not sure.

471
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,720
So,

472
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,410
you want to do it just because it's inevitable?

473
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,660
That makes it sound terrible.

474
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,410
But that is kind of how I feel,

475
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,010
so, yeah.

476
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,220
You're moving back in!

477
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,730
My girlfriend is moving in with me.

478
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,140
We need additional venous access to start the oxytocin.

479
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,160
I'll insert a 16-gauge IV.

480
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,260
How do you feel?

481
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,870
Good.

482
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,640
Insert a 16-gauge IV.

483
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,880
Okay.

484
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,050
All right.

485
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,510
There's gonna be a pinch.

486
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,440
Very good.

487
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,330
Once we start that drip, at least one baby will be born.

488
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,000
I understand.

489
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,550
Okay.

490
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,060
Where are you going?

491
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,070
Kenzie's only two centimeters dilated,

492
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,690
and even though I'm not a surgeon,

493
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,370
I have other important things to do.

494
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,230
You were wrong. First-years aren't godsends.

495
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,350
They're a lot of work.

496
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,200
But I fixed Olivia.

497
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,980
Wonderful. Now fix Jordan.

498
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,450
She's the one you have a problem with.

499
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,420
No. I... I don't.

500
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,380
Well, technically, she has a problem with you...

501
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,050
...and anyone in authority.

502
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,370
You need to rein her in.

503
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,810
Okay, how do I do that?

504
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,390
How'd you fix Olivia?

505
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,910
No new paint, no new parts.

506
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,870
No way you took this to a shop.

507
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,320
So, there is something up with you.

508
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,750
Something personal.

509
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,900
Something you don't care about.

510
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,080
That goes without saying.

511
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,930
Except, it's messing with my games.

512
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,040
I just wanna humiliate you

513
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,450
without feeling like I'm punching a kitten.

514
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,230
I was finalizing my divorce.

515
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,980
I thought you were already...

516
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,380
Not until yesterday.

517
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,210
And we didn't wanna deal with

518
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,040
a formal custody arrangement for Kellan,

519
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,210
but now that he's 18, it's official.

520
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
I know it's been over for years,

521
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,240
but when it's really over,

522
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,650
it hurts.

523
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,590
And I'm pissed at myself for being hurt,

524
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,960
and now pissed at myself

525
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,640
for admitting that to the coldest person I know.

526
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,590
My place has two masters with en suites,

527
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,540
and it's rent-controlled,

528
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,370
so it's still probably cheaper than your motel.

529
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,180
But staying with me will cost you.

530
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,270
Kitty gotta punch back.

531
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,350
Thanks. But I'm good.

532
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,430
She's at 10 centimeters.

533
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,610
Prepare packed red blood cells for possible transfusion.

534
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,600
Prepare forceps, clamps, and scissors.

535
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,420
How do you feel? Really feel?

536
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,810
I feel fine.

537
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,970
Why do you have a problem with authority?

538
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,640
Seriously?

539
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,740
I have a problem with you not acting like an authority.

540
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,540
You're not doing the one thing any junior needs

541
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,960
from their supervisor.

542
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,560
If I'm screwing up...

543
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,510
Not now. Not gonna screw up now.

544
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,130
I need to know you're at least watching.

545
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,400
I need to know you got my ass covered.

546
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,830
The leak in your bile duct has caused an infection

547
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,210
that could lead to peritonitis.

548
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,440
We've got you on multiple aggressive antibiotics,

549
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,010
but this infection acts very quickly,

550
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,010
sometimes in a matter of hours.

551
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,190
Well, I feel fine.

552
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,960
Dopey, but fine.

553
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:22,620
Billy, do you understand what I just told you?

554
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,710
I might die tonight.

555
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,520
I get it.

556
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,510
What... How do you do it?

557
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,460
I've... had worse days.

558
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,960
The day after Linda died...

559
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,010
I went to buy a gun.

560
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,440
Never used one before,

561
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,890
but I figured, "How hard could it be

562
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:00,690
to put it in my mouth and pull the trigger?"

563
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,700
On my way to the store,

564
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:10,160
I saw a car parked on the side of the road with a flat.

565
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,480
Couple of kids who...

566
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,950
clearly didn't know what the heck they were doing.

567
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,340
And for some reason,

568
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,090
I pulled over and changed their tire.

569
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,760
As I was leaving,

570
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,060
I told them, "Good timing.

571
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,460
Costco's got a sale on tires."

572
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,690
That's when I heard Linda's laugh.

573
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:43,520
"Hey, dummy. If you kill yourself,

574
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,870
who's gonna change the next tire?"

575
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,960
That's what saved my life.

576
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,000
Just wanting to help people.

577
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,380
Makes life worthwhile.

578
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,890
Brady.

579
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,520
His lungs are also underdeveloped.

580
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,540
He needs to be placed on a ventilator.

581
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,850
Let's get him to the NICU.

582
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,090
Starting magnesium sulfate.

583
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,720
That's to stop your labor.

584
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,590
I also need to ligate the umbilical cord

585
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,390
and return it to your uterus.

586
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,720
Okay, I have to focus on the patient

587
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,060
and I have to focus on Jordan and I also have to focus on you.

588
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,270
I don't know how to do that.

589
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,140
Clamp.

590
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,200
Don't worry about me.

591
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,890
I appreciate you noticing I needed help, but I'll be fine.

592
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,160
I didn't.

593
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,370
Dr. Andrews?

594
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,750
Your uncle. Absorbable sutures.

595
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,370
He told you?

596
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,560
Not that part. I googled that.

597
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,990
I couldn't trust your resume.

598
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,620
How do you feel?

599
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,060
I feel like my uncle doesn't think I can hack it.

600
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,430
I feel... sick.

601
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,010
She's having another contraction.

602
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,380
Adding terbutaline and calcium channel blockers.

603
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,270
Am I gonna lose Landy?

604
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,350
Am I gonna lose both of them?

605
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,010
I don't know.

606
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,420
She's still in labor?

607
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,430
Bp's 95 over 60.

608
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,050
Kenzie, we need to do a C-section.

609
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,410
No, no. If he comes out, he'll die.

610
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,080
If he doesn't, you both will.

611
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,070
- No. - 69 over 40.

612
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,760
We're doing a C-section.

613
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,050
- No! - Let's prep and drape her.

614
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,970
No. I can't.

615
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,160
I can't lose Landy.

616
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,030
No!

617
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,460
We need to restrain her.

618
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,580
Landy's going to be just fine.

619
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,290
- Landy is not... - Shh!

620
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,450
Kenzie, just listen to my voice, okay? Just focus.

621
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,460
What's your favorite board game?

622
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,910
No! No! Okay, restraints, please.

623
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,220
Look at me. Don't look at them.

624
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,220
Board game.

625
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,970
- Scrabble. - A classic. Nice!

626
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,450
Eight years from now,

627
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,430
Landy hits a triple word score with the word "breathe."

628
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,610
Try it. Breathe.

629
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,560
Good.

630
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,760
What's Brady doing?

631
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,850
He's...

632
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,960
He's mad that his brother just schooled him.

633
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,660
Of course he is.

634
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,950
100 over 65.

635
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,090
Contractions are stopping.

636
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,170
Words with "X" and "Z."

637
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,820
Only way you're gonna beat them.

638
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,920
I better brush up.

640
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,180
Delayed interval twin delivery?

641
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,030
- That's awesome. - I can't teach.

642
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,640
Did you ask the first-years how they feel?

643
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,980
Yes. Unhappy.

644
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,290
Okay, that's great.

645
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,100
Not that they're unhappy, but that you asked them,

646
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,240
they confided in you, and you learned something.

647
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,500
I learned that Olivia needed help, so I helped her,

648
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,290
and now she feels sick because I helped her.

649
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,490
Morgan says Jordan needs help,

650
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,030
but Jordan says she doesn't need help,

651
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,580
but Jordan's mad because I didn't help her.

652
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,670
Okay, that sounds tricky.

653
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,530
That was my point.

654
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,920
You know what? You'll figure it out.

655
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,180
And even if you don't this time, that's okay.

656
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,280
You'll learn something.

657
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,180
And you know what? You're a wonderful teacher.

658
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,330
I've been learning from you since the first day we met.

659
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,540
How's he doing?

660
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,610
Well, either he wakes

661
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,630
or he lapses into a coma and slowly fades away.

662
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,560
Beautiful day.

663
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,000
{\an1}BGM: Hold on to Me by Valerie Broussard

664
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,100
{\an9}? You've been walking alone for so long ?

665
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,430
You call Addy about your car?

666
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,260
Not yet.

667
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,700
Been a little busy.

668
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,330
Helpers aren't so good at asking for help.

669
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,650
Kinda glad I did, though.

670
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:53,500
{\an9}? This time, I know you'll be all right ?

671
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,480
{\an9}? 'Cause I'm standing at your side ?

672
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,400
{\an9}? 'Cause when you feel like you've been falling ?

673
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,600
Congratulations.

674
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,820
You helped save a life today.

675
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,710
Despite the bickering.

676
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,440
Opposing points of view are great,

677
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,570
as long as you actually listen to the other point of view.

678
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,580
You're carrying baggage that is affecting your decisions.

679
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,890
And you saw that because you're good at reading people.

680
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,370
Other people.

681
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,340
Figure out what you're carrying.

682
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:29,920
{\an9}? There is a light at the end of this long ride ?

683
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,570
{\an9}? This time, I know you'll be all right ?

684
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:39,000
{\an9}? 'Cause I'm standing at your side ?

685
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:47,070
{\an9}? 'Cause when you feel like you've been falling ?

686
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,460
{\an9}? Hold on to me ?

687
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:56,040
{\an9}? And when the river sweeps you right off your feet ?

688
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,080
{\an9}? Hold on to me ?

689
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,060
{\an9}? Hold on to me ?

690
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,340
It's a list of all the things you did right on this case.

691
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,540
You can hack it.

692
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,630
It's a list of all the things you did wrong on this case.

693
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,970
I'm covering your ass.

694
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,670
{\an9}? Hold on to me ?

695
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,810
{\an9}? Hold on to me, now ?

696
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,640
{\an9}? Take you to higher ground ?

697
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,610
{\an9}? Hold on to me ?

698
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,740
But don't be late if you don't want no bloody nose.

699
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,540
Would you do me a favor, Harry?

700
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,860
What?

701
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,870
Drop dead.

702
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,840
Great to see you've started your own clothing line,

703
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,960
the official gear of those who've given up.

704
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,000
By "en suite," I meant there's a trash can in your closet.

705
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,470
Want a ride?

706
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,980
Murphy told you.

707
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,290
You never knew your Great-aunt Winn.

708
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:57,470
She moved in with us when I was eight.

709
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,920
Your grandparents weren't getting along, lot of fighting.

710
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,990
But whenever it got really bad,

711
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,630
Auntie Winn would take your mom and me into the kitchen,

712
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,050
make cupcakes, something out of papier-mache,

713
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,450
or teach us a card game.

714
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,400
I've always wanted to be that kind of person for you.

715
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,100
You have been.

716
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,680
But now I need to know that you think I can do this.

717
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,500
Accepting your help...

718
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,650
makes me feel like garbage.

719
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,270
- Livy, I'm sorry. - I know. I...

720
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,750
I love you, too.

721
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,310
But I have to make this work.

722
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,620
Feels like home.

723
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,280
Again.

724
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,850
It feels like home again to me, too.

725
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,110
Maybe you're right.

726
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,310
Maybe things are the same.

727
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,420
No.

728
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,620
You were right. It's not the same.

729
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,500
It's better.
