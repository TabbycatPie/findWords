00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,161
(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,806
Sheila Amanda Sazs,
will you marry me?

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,088
Yes, I'll marry you.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,680
When we have kids, world, watch out.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,849
- Louis, I don't want kids.
- Sheila, I'm gonna be a father.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,803
Mike Ross is not coming
back to this firm.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,570
You heard Louis.
He already gave him the job.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,648
I want to know why the hell
you came back.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,207
What matters is that I'm staying,
because this is where I belong.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,162
This makes it look

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,567
like Forstman's payment
never went to any offshore accounts,

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,762
- and that you never took a piece of it.
- That's forgery.

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,127
Which is less of a crime
than what you did.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,842
I had no choice!

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,041
HARVEY: Bullshit, you had no choice!

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,811
You could've said no at any
goddamn point along the way.

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,842
JESSICA: One thing is for sure.

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,089
When all this is over,
I'm gonna fire the shit out of you.

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,806
I wouldn't be back here
if it wasn't for Louis.

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,122
I'll take care of it.

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,890
LOUIS: Dear Harvey and Jessica,

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,446
<i>I put all of you in jeopardy
for my own personal gain.</i>

23
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,723
Effective immediately,
I, Louis Litt,

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,844
am resigning
from Pearson Specter.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,689
Please take care of my home.

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,962
Ain't nothing wrong
with this chemistry

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,611
Ain't nothing wrong
with this place for me

28
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,161
Tell me now,
tell me now

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,681
Can you show me how,
show me how

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,082
To understand,
understand

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,771
Give me a second.
Give me a second.

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,441
You're not dressed for it,

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,642
but maybe we can get you
some trunks, go a few rounds.

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,162
I think I've already
gone a few rounds.

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,290
I need your help.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,323
Anything. What can I do for you?

37
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,647
Clients. I need clients.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,762
Louis, the bylaws say that...

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,644
Come on, Harvey. You think
I don't know what they say?

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,807
I wrote the bylaws.

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,763
Yeah, and who'd you
write 'em for, huh?

42
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,168
Jessica. And she's not gonna
make an exception for you.

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,567
- Maybe she'll make one for you.
- She's not going to.

44
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,841
Harvey, do you think
I want to be here?

45
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,883
I tried to get interviews
at six different firms,

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,002
and every one of them
said the same thing.

47
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,531
It's a blood bath out there.

48
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,450
Which means if I can't
bring business with me,

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,726
I might as well move to Siberia,

50
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,285
because I'm never gonna
find a job in this city.

51
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,367
- Louis...
- Harvey,

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,841
I'm not asking for the moon.

53
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,802
Just three companies

54
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,763
that I brought to the firm myself
when they were nothing.

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,924
- Let me talk to Jessica.
- Thank you.

56
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,768
Tell me now,
tell me now

57
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,930
What makes a good man,
good man

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,284
Harvey, you don't look busy.

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,447
Would you like to attend

60
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,608
the International Securities
Law Symposium?

61
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,491
That depends.
Is it in Vegas, Miami or Rio?

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,007
- Poughkeepsie.
- Send Paul Porter.

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,411
What can I do for you?

64
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,731
I just saw Louis.

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,200
- No. He's not getting any clients.
- He just wants three.

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,010
Letting them go won't break us.

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,886
No, it won't. But it will open
the floodgates for every partner

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,923
that ever thought of leaving
and taking their clients.

69
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,246
He's not "every partner,"

70
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,522
and he's worked his fingers
to the bone for both of us.

71
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,130
And he's asking for a crumb.

72
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,004
And I give him that crumb,
and next thing you know,

73
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,724
all the cookies in
the cabinet are gone.

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,727
You don't know that.

75
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,209
I do know that instead of talking
about giving Louis' clients away,

76
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,687
you should be working
on keeping your own.

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,801
Jessica, I'll find a way to keep VersaLife.
But that has nothing to do with Louis.

78
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,766
- We owe the man something.
- And I'm giving him something.

79
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,770
My phone rings and he gets
a glowing recommendation,

80
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,282
instead of me saying that he left
after committing a felony.

81
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,363
No one's gonna call
if he can't get in the door.

82
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,847
That's on him. Not on me.

83
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,406
Are you sure we should be doing this?

84
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,364
You really want those vultures in
bankruptcy picking through his stuff?

85
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,960
Just, it doesn't feel okay
going through his things.

86
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,321
Rachel, you haven't heard from him.
I haven't heard from him.

87
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,010
If we don't pack up his stuff, who will?

88
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,451
DONNA: I guess you guys
had the same idea I did.

89
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,085
BOTH: Yeah.

90
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,486
- He didn't take that, either?
- No.

91
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,368
I just cleaned it. It was smudged,

92
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,204
and I didn't want to
give it back to him dirty.

93
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,766
He must have been
in such a hurry.

94
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,087
He was in a hurry 'cause
he was ashamed. (SIGHS)

95
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,841
Come on. Let's get this over with.

96
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,883
- Jessica. What...
- Am I doing here?

97
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,565
I'm here to tell you

98
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,763
that I know you know the truth
about Louis' resignation.

99
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,809
- I don't know...
- Yes, you do.

100
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,649
And I'm guessing you didn't like it.

101
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,161
You're right. I didn't.

102
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,011
Because I don't think
that he deserves to be fired.

103
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,249
That's funny, because I think
you both deserve to be fired.

104
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,931
- What are you...
- You knew what he did

105
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,724
and you said nothing.

106
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,731
So, that's why you're here.
To fire me.

107
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,731
No. I'm here to give
you a second chance.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,889
Those don't look like my case files.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,480
They're not. But I didn't come
empty handed. I got you something.

110
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,571
- A job?
- General counsel at Procter and Gamble.

111
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,721
Procter and Gamble?

112
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,126
What is that, a joke?

113
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,050
They're in Cincinnati, which is,
like, American for Siberia.

114
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,004
It's American for number 31
on the Fortune 500

115
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,043
and it's a chance to make a fresh start.

116
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,050
Whose idea was this "chance?"
Her Majesty?

117
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,369
Oh, yeah, I bet she'd love that.
Ship me off and never see me again.

118
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,767
Louis, it was my idea.
And you should take it.

119
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,884
Would you take it?
No way on earth.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,484
You know why? Because this is Rome,
you're a gladiator, and so am I.

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,321
Then, be a gladiator. Take this job
and fight your way back here.

122
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,604
I don't have to go to Cincinnati
to fight my way back here.

123
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,888
I can goddamn fight Jessica.

124
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,121
(SIGHS)

125
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,881
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,402
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

127
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,723
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

128
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,049
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

129
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,084
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

130
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,602
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

131
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,290
All right!

132
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,883
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

133
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,124
The greenback boogie

134
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,281
You here to pick up your things?

135
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,721
I'm here to pick up
the three clients that are mine.

136
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,726
Those clients, like everyone this firm
represents, belong to me.

137
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,927
And there's nothing you can do about it.

138
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,281
Oh, yes, there is.
'Cause pursuant to the bylaws,

139
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,006
you're required to inform clients
of any attorney's departure.

140
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,451
If you fail to do so,

141
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,444
prior to me giving you formal notice
they're up for grabs.

142
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,007
Well, you wrote the bylaws.
I'll take your word that's what they say.

143
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,327
Oh, I see. You don't think
I can take 'em from you, huh?

144
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,169
Well, I'm the one who brought them in

145
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,049
and answered their call
at 4:00 in the morning

146
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,043
when all you did was take your cut.

147
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,566
Is that all I did?

148
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,763
Yes. And that's why I'm gonna win them,
because I deserve them.

149
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,360
And that's what it always
is with you, Louis, isn't it?

150
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,767
- What you deserve.
- You're goddamn right it is!

151
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,890
And you have some nerve telling me no
after all I've done for you.

152
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,809
What you've done is break the law.

153
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,366
And I'm still willing
to give you a good recommendation.

154
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,610
I don't need your bullshit
recommendation. I need clients.

155
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,687
And if you're not gonna give 'em to me,

156
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,768
you better strap in,
because I'm gonna take them.

157
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,211
Louis. You haven't returned
any of my phone calls.

158
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,601
I don't like contact
during transitional periods.

159
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,485
- But you didn't even say goodbye.
- What is there to say, Katrina?

160
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,683
Well, when you're ready,

161
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,766
I would love to take you out for dinner.

162
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,769
We can't do that.
You're on the other side now.

163
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,723
- What are you talking about?
- I gave Jessica notice.

164
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,727
I'm going after three clients.

165
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,763
- Louis...
- No, no, no. We're gonna go do battle.

166
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,002
And I do not want to put you in the
position to fraternize with the enemy.

167
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,963
You're not the enemy. Louis...

168
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,931
Jessica had me contact
all of your old clients in person.

169
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,166
She what?

170
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,248
You can't approach them.
It's over.

171
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,569
I have to get going.

172
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,810
Louis. I am so sorry.
I didn't want to do it.

173
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,367
Don't be. If it had to be somebody,
I'm glad it was you.

174
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,806
HARVEY: I'm in the middle of a merger.

175
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,888
What's so important that I had
to come down to your shitty office?

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,604
This used to be your shitty office.

177
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,609
And after that, it belonged
to six other people,

178
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,848
- five of whom are now gone.
- What's your point?

179
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,610
That things can change
in the blink of an eye.

180
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,970
- Louis.
- Yes, Louis.

181
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,321
It took all of 10 seconds
to scrape his name off the wall.

182
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,681
How long do you think it's gonna
take Jessica to scrape off mine?

183
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,807
What are you looking for, Mike?

184
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,605
Harvey, Jessica sees me
as a huge problem.

185
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,125
The solution is just to get rid of me.

186
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,608
I don't want that to happen, so I need
to solve an even bigger problem.

187
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,802
And you want me to
give you a bigger problem.

188
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,491
I just got back. I need you to give me
the biggest problem you've got.

189
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,922
Fine. Sterling Pharmaceuticals
is merging with Pfizer.

190
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,843
Come on, smart guy.
You wanted to solve the problem,

191
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,008
- you better be able to identify it.
- There is no problem.

192
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,329
They merge,
they only make up 26% of the market.

193
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,886
That's, that's not
over the limit per 10b-6.

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,081
Iii]

195
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,926
Shit.

196
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,481
VersaLife puts us over the limit.
We have to drop them.

197
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,285
Unless we figure out
a way around 10b-6,

198
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,562
like I told Jessica I would.

199
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,490
You told her that? Harvey,
no one has ever been able to do that.

200
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,206
Listen to me. You want to make
a splash? Part the Red Sea.

201
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,405
Oh, no.

202
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,483
- "Oh, no" what?
- You have that look on your face

203
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,284
like you want me to have
some emotional conversation

204
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,248
I don't feel like having.

205
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,926
You know what, Harvey? I just came in
here to see if you needed anything.

206
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,690
- I don't.
- Okay. Fine.

207
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,683
Listen, I know that this whole thing
with Louis is upsetting you.

208
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,848
No, what's upsetting me
is you saying you're here

209
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,962
to see if I need anything when
you really want to talk about Louis.

210
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,403
I'm worried about him.
He's in a really bad place.

211
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,170
You think I don't know that?
That's why I tried to help him.

212
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,363
I got him a job on a silver platter
and he threw it in my face.

213
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,481
- And he shouldn't have done that.
- Yeah.

214
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,840
Then, why are you here?

215
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,803
Because I still think
we can help.

216
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,841
- Donna...
- Harvey,

217
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,962
you did a good thing
by getting him that job.

218
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,287
It was the right instinct.
But it was the wrong city.

219
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,084
Yeah, I can't get him
anything in New York.

220
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,565
I'm not talking about New York.

221
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,569
Then, what the hell
are you talking about?

222
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,090
Nice grouping-

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,923
How'd you know I'd be here?

224
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,247
Because you go mudding when
you're happy and you come here

225
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,170
- when you're looking to blow off steam.
- Well, I am blowing off steam,

226
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,248
Donna, and I'm not finished. So,

227
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,807
unless you can handle a pistol, do me
a favor, please just leave me alone.

228
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,922
Uh, how do you...

229
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,601
Connecticut Junior Pistol Championship
Finalist, three years in a row.

230
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,926
What years?

231
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,247
Ask me that again,
and I will use this on you.

232
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,204
- Is there anything you can't do?
- No, there isn't.

233
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,803
Including talking Harvey
into getting you another job.

234
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,524
So, where is it this time?

235
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,962
Cincinnati? Minneapolis?
Anchorage, Alaska?

236
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,411
Boston.

237
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,886
- Sheila.
- Yes, Sheila.

238
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,121
You got Harvey to do this for me?

239
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,686
I got him to give you
his word he will do it.

240
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,086
But after you
turned down Cincinnati,

241
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,202
he's not gonna make the call
unless you say you're on board.

242
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,924
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

243
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,849
Donna, Sheila values strength.

244
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,884
She's gonna see this as me coming
to her at a time of weakness.

245
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,447
Louis, you go to Boston with
the sole purpose of being with her,

246
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,444
she's gonna see that
as a sign of love.

247
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,370
Tell him to make the call.

248
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,849
Okay, Kyle, I think the question
you have to ask is,

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,884
"Where do I see myself in 10 years?"

250
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,721
And unfortunately, the answer
is not as a Harvard graduate.

251
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,402
Idiot.

252
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,490
Louis. What are you doing here?

253
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,250
I'm here to take you back.

254
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,448
I... I don't understand.
The way we left...

255
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,688
I don't care how we left it.

256
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,882
Not a day has gone by
that I haven't thought of you.

257
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,806
And I can't hold
it back anymore.

258
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,729
Sheila, I love you.

259
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,846
And I want us to be together.

260
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,690
Louis, this is wonderful, but,
it's just a lot to take in.

261
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,165
To believe that you're
really ready to commit.

262
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,321
How is this for ready?

263
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,885
I'm taking a job in Boston.

264
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,570
- What?
- I quit Pearson Specter.

265
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,883
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God...

266
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,680
I can't believe it.
(CHUCKLES)

267
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,201
- You did all that for me?
- Yes.

268
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,890
Well, I...

269
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,120
- Well, what?
- I got a job in Boston for you.

270
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,328
Louis, did you make that decision
before or after you quit your old job?

271
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,808
- What difference does it make?
- It makes a huge difference.

272
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,046
You don't call for six months.

273
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,811
And then, one day,
you wake up, quit your job

274
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,287
and suddenly, I'm supposed
to fill the hole in your life?

275
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,811
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's not like that.

276
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,763
- Okay, then, what is it?
- I mean, do you know

277
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,566
how hard it was for me to not call you?
I was trying to move on.

278
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,806
Then, why didn't you move on?

279
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,322
Because I realized that I don't
need New York. I need you.

280
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,881
Louis, geography was
the least of our problems.

281
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,800
No, I know. And I want you to know
that I've come around on that.

282
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,042
You don't "come around" on children.

283
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,766
I don't want them and I'm not going
to change my mind.

284
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,684
You don't have to,
because I've changed mine.

285
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,922
Okay, and I believe
that you believe that.

286
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,611
Well, then, if you... I'm just sensing
that you don't know where I'm...

287
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,762
Louis, when I asked if you'd quit first,
I was asking because

288
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,204
if I, if I believed that you were
really ready to give up children,

289
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,847
I would run into
your arms and never let go.

290
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,122
But if you're doing this
because you're down and out...

291
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,207
But that's just it.

292
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,243
Do you understand
that I was going to change

293
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,449
my entire work schedule
weeks ago for you?

294
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,766
Before all this.

295
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,887
You were going to.
But you didn't.

296
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,367
Sheila, please. You have
to understand where I'm...

297
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,323
It was good to see you, Louis.

298
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,807
Please go.

299
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,881
I see frustration.

300
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,482
You see me getting
my ass kicked by FTC Rule 10b-6.

301
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,840
- And?
- Harvey needs an update

302
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,882
and I don't have shit.

303
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,445
And if you were Harvey
and he was Jessica,

304
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,971
you'd say you're all over it.

305
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,567
I can make that happen.

306
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,841
- Donna.
- I'm all over it.

307
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,962
Send a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue
to Jonathan Palmer

308
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,923
and get him tickets
to the next Sox game.

309
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,008
And then, find out
when his wife's birthday is,

310
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,162
his kid's birthday,
his dog's birthday.

311
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,327
How am I supposed to...

312
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,885
I don't care how you do it.
Figure it the hell out.

313
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,247
Harvey, this is a "thank you" to him.
Why are you so mad at me?

314
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,010
It's not a "thank you."
It's an apology

315
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,691
for you talking me into getting him
to give Louis a job.

316
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,490
He didn't even show up
to the interview.

317
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,045
And what's happening
with our VersaLife problem?

318
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,002
- I'm all over it.
- Yeah.

319
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,327
"All over it" means
that you don't have dick.

320
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,681
Next time I see you,
have something.

321
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,006
(SIGHS)

322
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,282
Jonathan Palmer's in Boston.

323
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,131
Harvey got Louis a job there
because of Sheila, didn't he?

324
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,207
- Yes.
- Donna,

325
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,846
if he didn't show up for the interview
it means it didn't work with Sheila.

326
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,362
Shit. He's gonna be devastated.

327
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,848
- You bring him his box of stuff yet?
- No, but I'm going to right now.

328
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,881
- Let me do it.
- Listen to me.

329
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,968
Harvey's pissed at you
because you don't have anything

330
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,167
and Louis needs me.

331
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,011
Donna, I am here because that man
put my wellbeing before his own.

332
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,441
He gave up going
after Sheila for me.

333
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,881
For all I know, that's why it didn't
work out for him up there.

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,131
It's... The least I can do
is comfort him when he's down.

335
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,082
Go.

336
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,967
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

337
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,486
Come in. Come in.
What are you doing here?

338
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,887
Your stuff has been sitting
on your desk for days.

339
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,128
I wanted you to have it.

340
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,083
Okay. I'll need it
for my new office.

341
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,321
You got a job?

342
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,641
- Not yet, but I will.
- Oh.

343
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,889
Order of the Coif.

344
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,691
Yeah. Look who graduated
magna cum laude.

345
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,565
Summa, actually.
For all the good it'll do me.

346
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,490
I know there's gotta be
a story behind this key.

347
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,329
Yeah? From one
of your first cases?

348
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,442
Mike, do me a favor, please.
Just stop it, will you?

349
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,800
- Stop what?
- Stop asking questions

350
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,968
that you already know the answers
to just to stay here longer.

351
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,889
- Louis, I'm not...
- You're not what? Examining me?

352
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,968
Yes, you are. You're just
making small talk while

353
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,491
you look around the room
to see if there are any

354
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,080
- sharp objects in the vicinity.
- That is not why I came here.

355
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,521
Well, it wasn't to deliver
a box of my shit.

356
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,651
Look, when I was drowning,
you threw me a lifeline. Okay?

357
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,125
Okay. That's nice of you to say,

358
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,806
and I appreciate you
bringing over my things.

359
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,524
But they're not exactly a lifeline.

360
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,565
- I heard about Boston.
- What'd you hear?

361
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,887
That Harvey got you a job
and you didn't even show up.

362
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,007
Well, why would I?

363
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,521
When the love of my life rips out
my heart and then stomps on it?

364
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,325
- Louis, I'm just trying to help.
- Well, you can't!

365
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,963
I don't have Sheila.

366
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,369
I don't have a job.

367
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,009
And right now,
I'd just prefer to be alone.

368
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,960
ROBERT: No.

369
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,846
Well, I don't care what he says.

370
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,806
Fifteen percent of bullshit
is still bullshit. Dick.

371
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,882
What can I do for you, Mike?

372
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,327
Well, I can see you're busy, sir,
so I'll just jump right to it...

373
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,487
Hold it right there.

374
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,570
If this is your asking me
for Rachel's hand in marriage,

375
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,330
you know you're going
about it the wrong way.

376
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,930
Sir, I think if I were gonna do that,

377
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,725
I'd have the foresight to ask your wife
how to approach you first.

378
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,166
Good answer.

379
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,765
(CHUCKLES)

380
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,930
- I'm actually here about Louis Litt.
- Yeah, I heard he resigned.

381
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,883
He did and he's looking for a job.

382
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,927
A fellow like that should have his pick.

383
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,771
Well, the partnership agreement
prohibits him from taking clients.

384
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,008
- Ooh. Shit.
- Yeah.

385
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,043
Yeah, Jessica doesn't
play around, does she?

386
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,440
She took his firstborn too?

387
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,449
Look, I know it's bad
out there, but...

388
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,325
Bad? It's the apocalypse
and I'm not running a soup kitchen.

389
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,680
If a partner can't bring me clients...

390
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,847
(CLEARS THROAT)

391
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,562
What's that?

392
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,887
Those are Louis' billables
for the last 15 years.

393
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,047
Mmm-

394
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,125
This guy ever sleep?

395
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,561
And he doesn't just bill.
He trains the associates,

396
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,485
he publishes,
he will give his life to you.

397
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,248
And you want me to do this
because you're with my daughter.

398
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,806
I want you to do this because
I've never asked you for a thing,

399
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,003
and the first time I am,
it's a favor for someone else.

400
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,963
That's the kind of man
that your daughter is with.

401
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,048
So, it's because you're
with my daughter.

402
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,920
You're gonna see it
how you're gonna see it.

403
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,886
But the real question is,
what are you gonna do about Louis Litt?

404
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,081
I'll meet with him.

405
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,929
- But there's no guarantee.
- That's all I can ask.

406
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,841
You tell my daughter
to give her old man a call sometime.

407
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,609
Yes, sir.

408
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,002
Hey.

409
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,486
You look happy.

410
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,246
I am happy.
Because today, I did a good thing.

411
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,170
You're going to let me paint the bedroom
"robin's egg blue?"

412
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,568
I said I did a good thing.
I didn't say I did a ridiculous thing.

413
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,364
(CHUCKLES)

414
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,687
I got Louis a job interview in New York.

415
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,770
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

416
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,086
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

417
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,322
Oh, I love you.

418
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,771
Let me fix you
a drink to celebrate.

419
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,769
Well, you should fix
one for yourself, too,

420
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,167
because I couldn't have
done it without you.

421
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,802
What do you mean?

422
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,246
I mean the interview's
with your dad.

423
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,445
What?

424
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,289
I went to your dad for Louis.

425
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,881
What?

426
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,961
It's really sweet.

427
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,411
Iii]

428
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,571
Let's just say there's a reason

429
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,286
that I didn't go to my dad
to pay for law school.

430
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,807
I thought you said it was
because you wanted to do it yourself.

431
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,400
It is. But other people
don't have a problem

432
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,887
going to their parents because

433
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,685
they don't have to wait
for the other shoe to drop.

434
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,205
What are you talking about?

435
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,890
He's not gonna give
something for nothing.

436
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,968
So, you mean, after this,
he's gonna want something from me.

437
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,087
I don't know.

438
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,680
But he's gonna
want something from someone.

439
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,002
If it gets Louis a fresh start,
I really don't care.

440
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,009
ROBERT: (CHUCKLING)
Oh, man. Really?

441
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,962
- You've got to be kidding me.
- No.

442
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,686
- You ate there, too?
- Every Tuesday for the last five years.

443
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,849
- Oh. Wednesday.
- BOTH: Chicken parm day.

444
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,882
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

445
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,206
More like Christmas to me.

446
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,966
- Oh, I believe it.
- Oh, Louis, this has been a pleasure.

447
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,010
But it's time that we got down
to the crux of the matter.

448
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,610
You want to know why I resigned.

449
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,929
Well, I did call Jessica and she gave you
a glowing recommendation.

450
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,525
And we both know that's bullshit.

451
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,646
- You want to know the truth.
- Did I say anything about the truth?

452
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,001
I'm just making sure
you know I know that it's bullshit.

453
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,726
But my truth is,
I don't care why you left.

454
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,484
All I care about is
what you're gonna take.

455
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,726
What?

456
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,680
You take one client,
I could give a shit how big it is,

457
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,484
and I'll make you
a senior partner on the spot.

458
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,362
Wait a second. Mike Ross said
I was not required to bring business.

459
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,842
This isn't about business.
This is about balls.

460
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,689
I don't need another grinder,
I need a lawyer

461
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,770
who can kick a door in. And the door
in question is Pearson Specter's.

462
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,087
You want to see if I can break
my partnership agreement.

463
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,361
You're damn right, I do.

464
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,041
Because if you can't do that,
then what the hell good are you?

465
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,761
(SCOFFS) You're no
different than Jessica.

466
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,882
(CHUCKLES) I'll take
that as a compliment.

467
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,849
If you'll excuse me,
Sylvia will validate you on the way out.

468
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,049
Yeah, well, Robert, this is, uh, New York.
I take a cab.

469
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,969
It's just my way of saying
"get the hell out."

470
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,921
LOUIS: Well, how long is "a little while?"

471
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,843
- Do you have any...
- Louis.

472
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,325
Excuse me.

473
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,128
- Katrina, what are you doing here?
- You know what I'm doing here.

474
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,846
This isn't your client anymore.
You're prohibited from contacting them.

475
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,406
- No, I'm not here to see...
- Neubacher Capital?

476
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,851
Yes, you are.

477
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,885
Just like you're going to go see
Carver Tech and Blackthome Simons.

478
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,688
- How do you know that?
- Because they called me.

479
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,529
- What are they saying?
- It doesn't matter what they're saying.

480
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,324
It's plain as day
you're trying to poach them.

481
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,805
- Does Jessica know?
- Not yet,

482
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,405
but if you keep doing this,
she's gonna find out.

483
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,602
Yeah, well, let her sue me,
'cause I don't have any other choice.

484
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,246
- What are you talking about?
- Robert Zane offered me senior partner

485
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,285
if I can break the partnership agreement.
That is a major law firm in New York.

486
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,925
I'm not gonna get
a better chance than that.

487
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,362
- Louis...
- Look, tell Jessica if you have to.

488
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,847
I don't want to get
you in trouble. Okay?

489
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,928
But I just lost my job.

490
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,560
And I just lost the woman I love
for the second time all in one week.

491
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,162
Now, I have this chance
to turn my life around

492
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,049
with this one client.

493
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,406
I'm gonna take it.

494
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,245
Louis.

495
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,287
You want one client,
I'll give you one client.

496
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,008
What? Wait, no.

497
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,841
When you agreed to take me on,
I swore that I would be loyal to you.

498
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,850
And if I'm not loyal now,
then I never was.

499
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,327
Katrina, if you do this
and Jessica figures it out,

500
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,967
she will fire you.
And I cannot live with that.

501
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,562
That won't matter if you get the job
and you take me with you.

502
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,091
Give me the goddamn name.

503
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,281
What?

504
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,850
I'm gonna tell you something
and I don't want you to overreact.

505
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,962
From the look on your face,
I'm not making any promises.

506
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,691
I just got an email from Louis.
He's going after VersaLife.

507
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,527
Get me Ray.

508
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,449
- What are you gonna do?
- Get me Ray!

509
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,642
Harvey, it was just
a notification email.

510
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,888
- You don't even know where he is.
- Yes, I do.

511
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,445
What are you talking about?

512
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,881
That notification is
required by the bylaws.

513
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,047
He's doing it at the last second,

514
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,482
I guarantee you he's walking
in VersaLife's door right now.

515
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,762
What the hell do you think you're doing?

516
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,887
Not "doing," "did."
I just signed VersaLife.

517
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,923
- You have no right.
- Please. I have every right.

518
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,044
Because when I quit, Jessica
only notified my clients, not yours.

519
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,447
Because she didn't think I had
enough balls to go after you head-on.

520
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,404
That wasn't her, that was me because
I didn't think you would stoop this low.

521
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,887
Oh, too bad. You exposed your flank
and now you're too late.

522
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,441
Yeah, you can see
the fear in my eyes.

523
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,005
Excuse me.

524
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,410
I told you, you're too late.

525
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,808
To tell them an unemployed clown
just sold them a pile of bullshit?

526
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,924
You mean the bullshit that you have
to drop them as a client?

527
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,769
The Pfizer merger.
FTC Rule 10b-6.

528
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,008
They were not pleased
that you kept them in the dark.

529
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,485
You are a son of a bitch.

530
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,802
Who's the clown now?
You're a son of a bitch.

531
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,366
I'm only taking one client
that you're gonna have to drop, anyway.

532
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,931
The least you could do
is be a gentleman about it.

533
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,804
A gentleman? I got you two jobs.

534
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,410
Two jobs in Siberia!

535
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,081
Out of Pity-

536
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,686
I got you those jobs
out of compassion.

537
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,770
Just like when I fought for Jessica
to not fire you in the first place.

538
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,644
But when I take VersaLife back,

539
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,842
it's gonna be without
any feeling for you at all.

540
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,924
What happened? I lost them,
but I'm gonna get them back.

541
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,329
What I want to know is how the hell did
Louis find out that we had to drop them?

542
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,283
I don't know. People know shit.

543
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,688
People don't know shit.
People get told shit.

544
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,007
Jessica, I know I wanted
to throw him a bone,

545
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,485
but I did not tell him.

546
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,602
I wasn't talking about you.

547
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,371
- I was talking about Mike Ross.
- Bullshit. Mike didn't...

548
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,050
Tell me you didn't have him
working on VersaLife.

549
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,400
- That doesn't mean...
- I knew it.

550
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,963
He was working on VersaLife.

551
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,242
He owes Louis
for bringing him back here.

552
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,850
That is motive and opportunity.

553
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,531
You just want him gone
by any means necessary.

554
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,042
Oh, I think I have been
more than clear about that.

555
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,686
Yeah, well, try another theory
because Mike would never do this.

556
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,323
Oh, there are a lot of things
you never thought Mike Ross would do.

557
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,923
Sell out an old man's company.
Get in bed with a billionaire.

558
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,771
Cut his boss out of a deal.

559
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,162
- Jessica...
- People change, Harvey.

560
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,490
And to top it all off, Louis
is taking VersaLife to Robert Zane.

561
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,807
Mike Ross' future father-in-law.

562
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,888
Why don't you think about that?

563
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,521
Mike, I need to know
what you have on VersaLife.

564
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,001
It was me.

565
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,930
- What was you?
- Louis going after them is my fault.

566
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,326
- What did you...
- I went to Robert Zane

567
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,283
and I asked him to give Louis a job.

568
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,449
That's it? You didn't
tell him about VersaLife.

569
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,847
Of course not.
You think I would do that?

570
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,847
Never mind what I think.

571
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,769
You went to one of
our biggest competitors

572
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,564
and put him together
with a desperate Louis.

573
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,682
I did it because Louis
was desperate. All right?

574
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,325
I went to see him the other
day to bring him his stuff...

575
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,282
The other day?

576
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,324
You're telling me when you were
supposed to be helping us

577
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,842
keep our client, you were busy
giving them to Louis on a silver platter?

578
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,287
I was, but I also figured out
how to get them back.

579
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,367
Why didn't you tell me then?

580
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,891
'Cause I was trying to
think of a better option.

581
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,286
What the hell's wrong
with this option?

582
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,051
It involves going to Walter Gillie.

583
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,723
Well, look who decided to drop by.

584
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,640
The man who lost me my company,
and his partner, who tore it to shreds.

585
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,524
Walter, I understand how you must feel.

586
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,926
So, why are you here?

587
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,724
Because we have a proposition for you.

588
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,640
- Does it involve an apology?
- It is an apology.

589
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,604
You want me to buy VersaLife?

590
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,768
We want you to buy
a division of VersaLife.

591
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,888
The division that makes that drug.

592
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,207
They've been working
on anti-addiction meds for years.

593
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,402
Look at the results.
This one works.

594
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,727
HARVEY: But it's a money-loser,
and it's gonna take years.

595
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,968
They don't have the capital,
the patience, or the will.

596
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,047
But you do.

597
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,881
And let me guess. You two are here
out of the goodness of your hearts.

598
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,887
You want the truth?

599
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,890
He'd be here whether this was
for his own good or not.

600
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,207
For me, I'm here because
it gets me out of a jam.

601
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,840
So, you can stick it
to us if you want to.

602
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,962
But if you do that,

603
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,323
you're gonna miss the chance to save
a lot of other people just like Phillip.

604
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,841
Don't ever talk to me
about Phillip again.

605
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,371
- Walter...
- No.

606
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,848
This is how all this started.
With you using my son.

607
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,810
No. I'm the one
who used your son.

608
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,201
I used him to get
control of your company.

609
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,881
But everything Mike did from the second
he met you was to save your company.

610
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,401
Because when it comes
to caring about people,

611
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,885
he's twice the man that I am.

612
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,889
And by the way,
he never gave up on you

613
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,081
and he never sold you out.

614
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,441
- Bullshit.
- You're right. It is.

615
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,965
Mike, no.

616
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,649
The truth is,
is that I gave you my word.

617
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,000
I told you I would never sell you out.

618
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,805
And then, I got into bed with someone
that I never should've trusted

619
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,161
- and I lost you your company.
- Yes, you did.

620
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,402
And that company was your family.
It gave you purpose.

621
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,922
But you still have money,
and this is a purpose.

622
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,771
Walter, if you don't want
to do this, I get it.

623
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,528
But I need you to understand
that the only reason I even

624
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,201
thought to come to you
in the first place,

625
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,369
is that I am gonna regret
what I did to you for the rest of my life.

626
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,448
- MIKE: Can I come in?
- Of course.

627
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,651
I hope you're not,
uh, furious with me.

628
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,241
I'm not mad.

629
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,889
- You're not?
- No.

630
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,286
Well, good.

631
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,240
(CHUCKLES) I wanted to, um,

632
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,091
thank you for setting up
that meeting with Robert Zane.

633
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,890
I just hope you understand that,
if I had a choice,

634
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,571
I never would've gone after VersaLife.
But I had no choice...

635
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,762
Louis, we took them back.

636
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,762
What? But you had to drop them.

637
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,247
Not anymore.

638
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,840
We convinced them to sell
their trial drug division.

639
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,009
Of course. You drop
a drain on their earnings,

640
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,645
their stock price goes
right through the roof.

641
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,444
And their market share
falls below the threshold.

642
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,762
- But who the hell would buy it?
- Walter Gillie.

643
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,965
(CHUCKLES)

644
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,010
Of course. Walter Gillie.

645
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,041
- Louis. Listen...
- Mike, you won.

646
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,121
- You're a brilliant lawyer.
- You are a brilliant lawyer.

647
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,322
I'm a brilliant lawyer
who's never gonna work again.

648
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,647
Hey, stop. That is not true.

649
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,329
(STAMMERING) Look at
everything that you have.

650
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,568
A Harvard Law diploma.
Summa cum laude.

651
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,522
Order of the Coif.

652
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,961
Those are the credentials
of a Supreme Court Justice.

653
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,811
Yeah, that and 2 bucks
will get me a seat on the subway.

654
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,250
But thank you for, uh, having
the decency to tell me in person.

655
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,809
Louis, come on.
Let me... Let me...

656
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,810
Let me stick around for a while.
We'll have a couple of drinks.

657
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,127
You can tell me
the story about that key.

658
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,963
Mike, I know what you're trying to do.

659
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,648
How's not the time.

660
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,205
Please go.

661
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,287
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

662
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,731
Come in.

663
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,650
You're not Louis Litt.

664
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,967
No, I'm not. But if you're
expecting him to show up,

665
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,686
- it's gonna be a long wait.
- You here to take his spot?

666
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,167
I'll give you senior partner right now.

667
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,931
I'm here to tell you
you're not getting VersaLife.

668
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,610
I'm sorry.
I don't know who that is.

669
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,290
It's the company
you tried to poach from me.

670
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,006
- You seem upset.
- I'm not upset.

671
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,969
I just wanted to remind you,
you once told me

672
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,851
I was a piece of shit
for using your daughter against you.

673
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,968
Now, you turn around
and use Louis against me.

674
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,242
- That's not the same.
- It is to me.

675
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,364
I may fight with him,
but he's still my family.

676
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,324
- Then, why did he leave?
- That's between me and Louis.

677
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,286
I wanted VersaLife,
but it's not worth gloating over.

678
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,129
So, why are you really here, Harvey?

679
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,004
I'm here to ask you
to take Louis anyway.

680
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,851
- And why would I do that?
- 'Cause you're a smart man.

681
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,803
If you do it, I'll owe you one.

682
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,689
I don't need you owing me one.

683
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,769
Why don't you take the night
to think about it?

684
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,927
Because if there's
one thing I've learned,

685
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,883
you can never have
too many favors in the bank.

686
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,884
You wanted to see me?

687
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,486
I heard about VersaLife.
Good work.

688
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,721
It wasn't you.

689
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,166
No, it wasn't.

690
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,442
You know I thought it was you.

691
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,682
Harvey didn't tell me, but I didn't
just fall off of the turnip truck.

692
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,370
No, you didn't.

693
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,042
What?

694
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,926
Every damn time I think
there's no upside to having you,

695
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,522
you do some shit to make me think
it's actually nice to have you around.

696
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,727
So, we're good?

697
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,568
We're good after you bill
a few more hours tonight.

698
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,766
Well, that's gonna
have to wait until later,

699
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,087
because I am definitely
going out to celebrate.

700
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,609
You've earned it.

701
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,562
Jessica.

702
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,526
She did what Harvey
would've done for you.

703
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,726
- Jessica.
- Katrina.

704
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,887
Is this about...

705
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,403
I can either fire you
or you can resign.

706
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,567
The choice is yours.

707
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,801
You know.

708
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,206
I know.

709
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,048
Then, why are you being
so nice about it?

710
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,640
Because letting you go is enough.

711
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,240
And you also don't want
to antagonize me,

712
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,169
since I'll be
working for Robert Zane.

713
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,926
You haven't heard.
We got VersaLife back.

714
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,767
Louis won't be going to Zane,
and neither will you.

715
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,887
I wish you luck.

716
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,241
You'll have my letter of resignation
on your desk in the morning.

717
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,890
Because my mind is gone

718
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,287
To find a stone
you can write my name on

719
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,641
To dig a hole in the ground

720
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,845
For my broken crown
in my golden casket

721
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,129
And my mind is gone

722
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,801
To find a stone
you can write my name on

723
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,409
To dig a hole in the ground
so I can lay down

724
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,531
- What took you so long?
- What are you, the bathroom monitor?

725
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,847
If I were, I'd say you've gone
three times in an hour.

726
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,849
Yes, and this is our third drink.

727
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,042
You know they have
medicine for that, right?

728
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,644
- You saying I'm old?
- Yes.

729
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,808
But I'm also saying I know you
haven't been going to the bathroom.

730
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,002
All right. You want the truth?
I've been calling Donna.

731
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,929
Oh, my God.
That is so great.

732
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,247
You guys finally decided
to take the plunge.

733
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,567
I wanted to know
if Robert Zane called me back.

734
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,684
- Called you back about what?
- I asked him to hire Louis, anyway.

735
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,086
- You're kidding.
- I'm not.

736
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,282
I even told him if he did,
I'd owe him one.

737
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,880
- Hmm.
- What?

738
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,889
Oh, I'm just trying to figure out
at what point in the last week

739
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,889
you decided to become a pussy.

740
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,368
Oh, so, doing something
nice for someone makes you a pussy.

741
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,891
- I didn't say that exactly.
- Yes, you did.

742
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,128
Let's go through some of the nice things
you've done for people.

743
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,481
You know what, Harvey?
Guilty as charged. I am nice.

744
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,204
And if that makes me
a pussy, then so be it.

745
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,287
Then, it's settled.
You're a nice pussy.

746
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,011
Miss, can I get a cosmo
here for my friend?

747
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,361
Go ahead. Order another drink.
Just be careful,

748
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,323
'cause you're gonna be in the bathroom
in another five minutes.

749
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,885
You're going back
to the prostate again?

750
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,241
What, like you've never
repeated jokes before?

751
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,681
- I have no idea what...
- What I'm talking about?

752
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,690
Let's see. Uh, you see,
that's funny because blah-blah-blah.

753
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,768
Or by blah-blah-blah,
I mean blah-blah-blah.

754
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,728
- And...
- Okay I get it.

755
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,882
Oh, I'm just getting started.
I could do this all night.

756
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,128
Yeah, you know what?
Now, I have to go to the bathroom.

757
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,481
Go for it. Take your time.
No rush.

758
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,523
(WHISPERING) If it hurts, call someone.

759
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,481
Louis. What are you doing here?

760
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,082
- Waiting for Harvey.
- Harvey's not here.

761
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,005
Then, you'll have to do.

762
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,131
Look. Louis, I know
you've been through a lot.

763
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,890
- But Harvey's gonna...
- I don't give a shit

764
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,806
- what Harvey's gonna do.
- Okay, you're scaring me.

765
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,891
- You know what an Oscar looks like?
- What?

766
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,571
Academy Award.
Bald guy.

767
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,330
I mean, of course we all know
what it looks like.

768
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,084
But especially you.
You're an actress.

769
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,611
It's the highest
honor in your field.

770
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,451
I mean, of course you don't
need to be told what it is.

771
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,847
- What are you talking about?
- See, the highest academic honor

772
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,123
at Harvard Law
is the Order of the Coif.

773
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,765
You don't get a trophy.
You get three things.

774
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,485
You get a parchment
to hang on your wall,

775
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,807
a medal to wear at graduation,

776
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,564
and this.

777
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,202
Now, this key doesn't
say "Order of the Coif."

778
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,085
it doesn't say anything.
It's just a symbol.

779
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,362
What does that have to do with Harvey?

780
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,766
It doesn't. It has to do with Mike.

781
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,609
You know what, Louis?
It's been a long day...

782
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,801
It's about to get longer.

783
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,881
See, Mike asked me about this.

784
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,242
And I thought he was... (CHUCKLES)

785
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,244
I thought he was trying to get my mind
off of my problems.

786
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,126
But then, he did it again.
And it got me to thinking.

787
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,884
Mike graduated
magna cum laude.

788
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,921
He's in Order of the Coif.

789
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,046
- But he didn't recognize this.
- So, he forgot a stupid key.

790
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,606
Mike Ross doesn't forget anything.

791
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,970
You see, the reason he didn't recognize
this was because he never got one.

792
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,931
Because he didn't go to Harvard.

793
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,289
Louis, we've been down this road before.
Mike is in the Harvard database.

794
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,609
But he's not in the yearbook.
And, according to his credit report,

795
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,803
his address during his law school years
was in New York.

796
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,161
He even paid rent the first
of the month in person.

797
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,321
- Well, I'm sure there's a...
- Sit down!

798
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,205
Last year, you told me
not to tell Sheila about Mike's file.

799
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,366
You acted like you cared about me.
You didn't give a shit about me.

800
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,370
- You cared about you and Harvey,
- No.

801
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,891
- And Mike, and Jessica...
- No.

802
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,607
- Louis, that's not true.
- Well, let's call Sheila right now.

803
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,722
I know all of the numbers by heart.

804
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,047
I mean, she may not be
interested in me anymore,

805
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,926
but she will definitely be interested in
a fraud claiming that he went to Harvard.

806
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,170
I'm sorry.

807
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,885
You're sorry?

808
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,646
You've been lying to me since
the day Mike Ross arrived.

809
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,328
I knew Harvey and Jessica
never really accepted me.

810
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,681
But I thought you were different.

811
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,600
- I thought you were my friend.
- I am your friend, Louis.

812
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,131
No, you're not.

813
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,971
And don't you ever
say that to me again.

814
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,929
Where are you going?

815
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,928
To see your friend, Jessica.

816
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,565
Louis knows.

817
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,805
Louis.

818
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,604
I know you're a stickler for the rules,

819
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,603
so I figured I'd
just come by to return my ID.

820
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,091
You want an explanation.

821
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,929
I wanna see you perp
walked through the bullpen

822
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,931
with your pretty little jacket
draped over your handcuffs.

823
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,122
But until then,
yeah, I'll take an explanation.

824
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,451
When I found out
the truth about Mike Ross,

825
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,087
- it had already been done.
- By Harvey.

826
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,922
Right after he made
senior partner over me?

827
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,283
That's when he hired the fraud?
That's the correct timeline, right?

828
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,731
Yes.

829
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,605
So, instead of turning him in,
you cover it up.

830
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,849
- Louis...
- And the one time that I do something,

831
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,242
you don't cover it up at all.

832
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,371
You throw me to the wolves.

833
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,528
I saved you from the wolves.

834
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,047
Then I ask you
for the smallest gesture,

835
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,766
just to allow my career
to continue with dignity,

836
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,568
and you couldn't muster
the tiniest shred of compassion.

837
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,166
What do you want me to say?

838
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,971
I want you to tell me you're a liar!

839
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,642
And a hypocrite!

840
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,006
And I want you to say you're sorry.

841
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,405
I am a liar.

842
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,366
And I am a hypocrite.

843
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,367
But I will not say I'm sorry.

844
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,604
Because I did what I did
to protect this firm.

845
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,041
Well, it looks like the captain's
about to go down with her ship.

846
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,607
Bullshit. You want something.

847
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,889
- Oh, I told you. I want to see you...
- In handcuffs?

848
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,529
If that were true,
the police would be here instead of you.

849
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,050
No.

850
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,926
You wanted to see me squirm

851
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,010
before asking me
for what you really want.

852
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,369
I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction.

853
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,289
So, you might as well spit it out.

854
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,767
You asked me what I wanted
once before and I told you.

855
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,042
And then you told me
that I couldn't have it.

856
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,090
But now, I can.

857
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,086
Pearson...

858
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,570
Specter...

859
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,490
Lift.
