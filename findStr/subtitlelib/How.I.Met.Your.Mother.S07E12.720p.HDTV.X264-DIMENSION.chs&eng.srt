00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,390
<i>孩子们  我有没有告诉过你们</i>
<i>Kids, have I ever told you</i>

11
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,500
<i>我和你们父亲的浪漫史</i>
<i>the story of how I met your father?</i>

12
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,080
<i>好吧  我就跳过这段</i>
<i>Well, I'll just skip ahead</i>

13
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,350
<i>直接说我告诉他我怀孕的事吧</i>
<i>to the moment I told him I was pregnant.</i>

14
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,710
怎么回事
W... What happened?

15
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,170
我晕过去了吗
Did I pass out?

16
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,350
不完全是
Not exactly.

17
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,140
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

18
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,950
你确定你不是单纯的变胖吗
Are you sure you're not just getting fat?

19
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,350
当然
Oh, yeah.

20
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,670
好吧  你怀孕了
So, um, you're pregnant.

21
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,540
是啊
Yeah.

22
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,720
怎么你的胸还是依旧平坦
Looks like nobody told your boobs.

23
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,700
怎么回事
What happened?

24
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,360
-我晕过去了吗  -我打死你
- Did I pass out? - Oh, my god...

25
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,220
女侠  手下留情
Please stop hitting me!

26
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,090
你...
Hey. Are...

27
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,900
你确定你真的...
Are you sure you're...

28
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,370
不  我还没验呢
Well, no, not positive.

29
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,550
我例假迟了一周
I'm a week late.

30
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,860
可我从来都很准
But I'm never late;

31
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,270
这点一直让我引以为豪
it's a point of pride with me.

32
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,120
为了保险起见  我周一要去看医生
I'm going to go see the doctor on Monday to find out for sure.

33
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,250
在那之前  不要告诉任何人
Until then, not a word of this to anyone.

34
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,750
凯文也不行吗
Not even Kevin?

35
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,060
有可能是他的呀
I mean, it's probably his.

36
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,410
我可是花了多年时间  调教我的子弟兵们往反方向游
I've spent years training my boys to swim the other way.

37
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,570
我还没跟凯文睡过呢
Kevin and I haven't had sex yet.

38
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,680
如果我怀孕了  你就是孩子他爸
If I'm pregnant, you're the dad.

39
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,990
真是太好了
That's wonderful!

40
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,930
我要当爸爸了
I'm gonna be a daddy!

41
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,780
好了  爸比喝威士忌
Okay, one scotch for me,

42
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,840
妈咪喝烈酒杯盛的冰茶
one iced tea on the rocks glass for Mommy.

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,590
-住嘴  -抱歉抱歉
- Stop it. - Sorry, sorry.

44
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,230
这事要保密
Keeping it secret.

45
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,230
糟糕  我把我那杯给你了
Oop, I think I gave you the wrong one.

46
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,510
来  让我...
Here, let me just...

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,000
给我  松开  放手
Give it to me. Drop... let go.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,740
让我把酒拿回来
Take it away from you.

49
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,010
巴尼  你为什么这么高兴
Barney, why are you so happy about this?

50
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,360
因为这是件大喜事
Because this is perfect.

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,430
我一直想当个爸爸
I want to be a dad.

52
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,460
这可不是什么好消息
This is not good news.

53
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,510
我还有个男友
I have a boyfriend.

54
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,330
是啊  但如果没有凯文呢
Yeah, but if Kevin weren't around...

55
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,420
这都无关紧要了
It doesn't matter!

56
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,260
我不想要孩子
I don't want kids.

57
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,240
我从没想过要孩子
I've never wanted kids,

58
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,950
从不  再过一百万年
and never, in a million years,

59
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,990
我也绝不会想要孩子
will I ever want kids.

60
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,980
抱歉  孩子们
Sorry, kids.

61
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,630
我不能有孩子
I can't have a baby.

62
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,900
大家好
Hey, guys!

63
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,180
猜猜这是什么
Guess what this is!

64
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,750
你的一只袜子  答对了  你个大巨人
One of your socks? Boom! You're huge.

65
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,800
不  这是我们未出生儿子的圣诞袜
No, it's our unborn son's Christmas stocking.

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,360
从我和莉莉结婚那天起
Grandma Gunderson started knitting it

67
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,260
冈德森祖母就开始织了
the day Lily and I got married.

68
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,440
直到临终前也没能织完
She died before she could finish.

69
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,420
我真想念圣诞袜
I miss stockings.

70
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,510
我继父科林特逼我们舍弃一切
My stepdad Clint made us get rid of anything

71
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,220
会使他想起圣诞节商业化的东西
that reminds him of the commercialization of Christmas.

72
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,610
你说过他有打扮成圣诞老人的模样呀
I thought you said he dresses up as Santa.

73
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,440
是啊  但是为了抗议性别成见
Yeah, but, uh, to protest gender stereotypes,

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,560
他打扮成女圣诞老人
he plays Santa as a woman.

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,090
不过他还留着胡子
Though, he keeps the beard.

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,780
结果就是弄巧成拙
The result is disturbing.

77
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,220
我们该走了
Well, we should go.

78
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,190
得去"婴儿总动员"商店
We have to get to We B Babies

79
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,380
订购新生儿欢迎会上的礼品
so that we can register for our shower.

80
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,340
我去不了
No can do.

81
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,660
我在搞一个大工程
Um, I have a big project that I'm working on.

82
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,200
这是理查德・霍德曼在东梅多的房子
This is Richard Holdman's house in East Meadow.

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,150
去年  他家成了横跨三州最受欢迎的
Last year, he had the most visited Christmas display

84
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,140
圣诞装饰景观
in the tri-state area.

85
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,260
但今年不会了  知道为什么吗
But not this year. You know why?

86
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,560
因为大软糖空降此地
Because Big Fudge has come to town,

87
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,560
大软糖是马修学校酒吧打游戏机时用的代号

88
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,800
他还带来了两个朋友
and he brought his two friends:

89
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,380
曼海姆  和压路机
Mannheim... Steamroller.

90
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,380
曼海姆压路机  美国著名圣诞歌曲乐队组合

91
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,700
比赛开始
Game on.

92
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,690
你没事吧
Are you okay?

93
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,480
没事
Yeah.

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,990
只是...
Uh, it's just, um...

95
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,830
我讨厌曼海姆压路机乐队
I hate Mannheim Steamroller.

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,870
你就不能用别人吗
Isn't there anyone else you can use?

97
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,850
拜托  如果不用压路机  我还能用谁啊
Come on! Who am I gonna use if not the Steamroller?!

98
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,730
我不知道  AC/DC如何
I don't know. AC/DC?

99
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,730
AC/DC  澳洲重金属乐队

100
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,520
AC/DC
AC/DC?

101
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,950
罗宾  你知不知道
Robin, do you have any idea

102
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,410
曼海姆压路机  何以得名
why they call them Mannheim Steamroller?

103
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,340
因为他们的摇滚
Because they rock...

104
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,710
又劲爆  又有节日气氛
so hard, so festively,

105
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,320
就像压路机那样威力无穷
that steam comes out of your brain.

106
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,600
让人服服帖帖
As it melts.

107
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,320
那我得自己去"婴儿总动员"了
So I have to go to We B Babies by myself?

108
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,880
罗宾和我跟你一起去
Robin and I will go with you.

109
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,580
婴儿总动员

110
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,040
巴尼  我们干嘛跟来
Barney, what are we doing here?

111
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,000
我想让你知道生小孩
I want to show you that having a kid

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,130
没什么好怕的
is nothing to be afraid of.

113
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,350
孩子们  别闹腾了
Kids. Stop.

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,260
开始采购  表单第一项
Okay, first on the registry:

115
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,230
乳头黄油滋养霜
nipple butter.

116
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,970
你要是母乳喂养
As you breast-feed,

117
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,020
你的乳头就会变长  大约长四英寸
your nipples stretch out, like, four inches

118
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,740
还会引起干燥和皲裂
and get all dry and cracked.

119
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,650
乳头滋养霜能防止乳头干裂出血
The nipple butter stops the bleeding.

120
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,510
我四英寸长的乳头不但干裂  还会出血
My four-inch nipples are going to crack and bleed?!

121
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,210
是啊  可宝宝咬着你干裂出血的乳头时
Yes, but while the baby is gnawing on your bleeding nips,

122
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,090
看她穿的衣服多可爱呀
look what she'll be wearing.

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,180
疯子杜安
Insane Duane?

124
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,730
巴尼
Barney?

125
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,130
那还是在认识我和泰德叔叔前
Insane Duane was your father's best friend,

126
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,040
疯子杜安是你们爸爸的死党
back in the days before he met me or your Uncle Ted.

127
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,600
我们准备去她家了
We're going back to her place.

128
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,390
一击即中
Boom!

129
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,110
好样的  你赢了
All right, you win!

130
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,190
这是奖励你说了一个词就钓上了一个妞
Here's 20 for picking up a girl with only one word.

131
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,460
再奖励你二十  因为你用的那个词是"擎天柱"
And here's another 20 for that word being "Boner."

132
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,550
谢谢
Thank you.

133
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,230
一小时后这里见  等我玩完了...
I'll meet you back here in an hour when I'm done with, uh...

134
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,190
管她叫什么呢
Ah, who cares what her name is;

135
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,480
反正不过是过眼云烟
she won't be around long enough for it to matter.

136
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,490
漂亮
Nice!

137
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,790
亲爱的  这是我朋...
Honey, this is my frien...

138
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,940
真不敢相信  那之后我就没见过你了
I can't believe I haven't seen you around.

139
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,750
自从希拉和我打了个快炮后
Well, after Sheila and I had that quickie,

140
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,090
我的生活就是三点一线  陪玩  幼儿园  便便
my life's been playdates, preschools and poops.

141
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,620
我好多年没去过酒吧了
I haven't set foot in a bar in years.

142
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,300
难道你戒酒了
You stopped drinking?

143
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,610
不  唯有酒能解千愁
Oh, I still drink.

144
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,270
阴道镇痛麻醉喷雾
Vaginal numbing spray.

145
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,890
显然  生完孩子后
Apparently, after child birth,

146
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,950
你的阴道就跟拳王洛奇的脸一样伤痕累累
your hoo-ha looks like Rocky Balboa's face.

147
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,810
-你不能生小孩  -我不能生小孩
- You can't have a baby! - I can't have a baby!

148
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,340
第二天  我们去看了医生
The next day, we went to the doctor.

149
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,350
是这样  特布罗斯基太太
Well, Mrs. Scherbatsky,

150
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,480
我肯定  你和你丈夫
I'm sure that you and your husband...

151
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,680
他不是我丈夫
Uh, he's not my husband.

152
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,810
真对不起
Oh, I'm so sorry.

153
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,210
那就是你的男友
Your boyfriend then.

154
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,220
他不是我男友
He's not my boyfriend.

155
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,020
我晕啊
Oh, bozhe.

156
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,270
那好  我就开门见山说吧
All right, well, I will just cut to the chase.

157
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,240
等等  等等
Wait! Wait.

158
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,440
好吧
All right.

159
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,380
好了
Okay.

160
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,050
好  准备好了  很好
All right, we're ready. Good.

161
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,280
你  没怀孕
You are not pregnant.

162
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,810
太好了
Yeah!

163
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,690
-太棒了  -就是
- Oh, yeah! - Yeah!

164
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,570
我就说哪有这么容易中奖呀
That's what I'm talking about!

165
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,240
对  你知道  你知道
Yeah, you know, you know!

166
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,110
再次抱歉  孩子们
Again, sorry kids.

167
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,140
先生
Hey, mister.

168
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,560
你准备把这些圣诞灯全挂上吗
Are you putting up all these Christmas lights?

169
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,930
小子  等我一旦完工
Oh, kid, by the time I'm done,

170
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,730
就算你在外太空  也能看到我的惊世之作
you're gonna be able to see this son of a bitch from outer space.

171
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,510
真酷
Ah, cool.

172
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,500
我想在我们家房子上装彩灯
I wanted to put lights on our house,

173
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,970
可我爸爸不是忙着工作  就是忙别的事情
but my dad says he's too busy with work and stuff.

174
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,920
要不这样吧  你下周末来我家
Hey, what do you say, uh, you come back here next weekend

175
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,620
给我打打下手
and help me out?

176
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,680
好
Yeah!

177
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,160
就这么说定了
You've got yourself a deal.

178
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,320
我叫斯科特
I'm Scott.

179
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,690
我是埃里克森先生
I'm... Mr. Eriksen.

180
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,720
谢谢  埃先生
Thanks, Mr. E.

181
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,030
埃先生
Mr. E.

182
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,380
看来某个小鬼刚赢得
Looks like some little scamp just earned the right

183
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,630
给小耶稣戴上维京队头盔的殊荣
to put the Vikings helmet on baby Jesus.

184
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,630
圣诞彩灯上会给小耶稣带上皇冠
而维京队是马修家乡明尼苏达州的橄榄球队

185
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,330
后来几天  在我尽情享受
Later that week, as I was enjoying every second

186
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,920
没有怀孕的每一刻时
of not being pregnant...

187
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,740
下集《少女妈咪》预告...
Next on Teenage Mommies...

188
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,490
可你说你会看好贝拉
But you said you would watch Bella.

189
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,760
我还要去拉拉队训练呢
I have cheerleading practice.

190
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,380
还好我不象你  布雷斯
Sucks to be you, Braces.

191
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,700
你好哟
Yello!

192
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,400
好  我可以去复诊
Uh, yeah, I can come back in.

193
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,830
罗宾  我们上周做了几项检测
Robin, we ran some tests last week.

194
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,820
我知道这会让你很难接受
This is going to be difficult to hear.

195
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,130
<i>然后医生说了一堆医学术语...</i>
<i>And then the doctor said a bunch of medical stuff that...</i>

196
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,920
<i>反正重点是这句话</i>
<i>well, the gist of it was this.</i>

197
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,290
我不能生孩子
I can't have a baby.

198
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,460
对  你不能生孩子
No. You can't have a baby.

199
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,030
太好了
Uh, great.

200
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,490
我是说  其实也没那么好
Uh, well, I mean, um, not-not great.

201
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,410
反正我从来都不想生孩子
I mean, I've never wanted kids,

202
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,190
如果这事发生在别人身上的话就...
so if it has to happen to someone...

203
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,130
罗宾  你有可以倾诉的对象吗
Robin, is there anyone you can talk to about this?

204
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,300
或许跟好友说一下
Perhaps a close friend?

205
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,440
我知道我能找朋友倾诉
I knew I could have talked to my friends.

206
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,190
可我已经料想到
But, it's just, I already knew

207
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,060
他们的种种反应了
exactly how they would all react.

208
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,030
为了哄我开心  泰德会大费周章
Ted would go into overdrive trying to make me feel better.

209
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,400
你要吃点舒心美食
You need comfort food.

210
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,820
炸鸡  汉堡配芝士  土豆泥
Fried chicken, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes.

211
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,690
打开礼物  我来给你揉肩
Open your present, I'll work on these shoulders.

212
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,320
好了  深呼吸  放轻松  吃鸡
Okay, just breathe, relax, eat your chicken.

213
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,950
快  吃  吸气
Come on, eat, breathe,

214
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,960
开礼物  呼气  开啊  快吃
open it, breathe, open it, eat.

215
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,000
罗宾  你怎么那么紧绷呀
Robin, why are you so tense?!

216
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,640
莉莉会悲痛欲绝
Lily would just implode.

217
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,830
而我居然还不停地唠叨孩子的事
And here I've been going on and on about babies.

218
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,510
我真不够朋友
Oh, I am such a bad friend!

219
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,610
最后搞得我要反过来安慰她
And I'd wind up comforting her.

220
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,890
没事的
It's okay.

221
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,420
你就冲我脸狠劲来一拳吧
You have to punch me in the face!

222
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,810
马修会问我一大堆
Marshall would ask me a ton of questions

223
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,480
我自己都无法回答的问题
I don't know the answers to.

224
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,460
-你考虑过收养吗  -这个...
- Have you thought about adoption? - Um, well...

225
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,530
你这是家族遗传的不孕不育吗
Does this kind of thing run in your family?

226
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,430
你上次经期是几号
What was the date, duration

227
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,590
持续了多久  周期稳定吗
and consistency of your last period?

228
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,920
而你们老爸会使劲浑身解数
And your father would bend over backwards

229
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,090
博我一笑
trying to make me laugh.

230
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,630
一个牧师和一个犹太法师走进一家酒吧
A priest and a rabbi walk into a bar--

231
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,790
不  是家理发店  不  是邮局
no, a barbershop-- no, a post office--

232
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,180
不  是两个牧师  不  是两只鸭子
no, it's two priests-- no, it's two ducks--

233
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,820
不  是一个牧师抱着一只鸭子  是个波兰种
no, a priest holding a duck-- and he's Polish.

234
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,950
我是说牧师是波兰人  不是鸭子
The priest, not the duck.

235
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,430
其实鸭子也可以是波兰鸭
Actually, the duck could be Polish, too.

236
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,710
不过这没关系
Doesn't matter.

237
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,010
当然有关系  鸭子不是波兰鸭
Yes it does. The duck's not Polish.

238
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,190
如果还不能让我笑的话
And when that didn't work,

239
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,230
他真的会使尽"浑身"解数
he would actually bend over backwards.

240
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,040
屁股开花
Pratfall!

241
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,390
归根到底  我就是不想跟人倾诉
The bottom line is, I didn't feel like talking about it.

242
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,850
所以当泰德问起
So when Ted asked...

243
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,610
罗宾  你没事吧  你看起来很低落
Hey, Robin, you okay? You look upset.

244
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,700
我当时脱口而出撒了一个谎
I just came up with the first lie that popped into my head.

245
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,280
是啊
Yeah. Uh...

246
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,050
我发现我永远也无法
I just found out I can never...

247
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,780
成为加拿大国奥队的撑竿跳选手
be a pole-vaulter for the Canadian Olympic team.

248
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,360
可能我太高了吧
I'm too tall or something.

249
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,000
-罗宾  太遗憾了  -真是可惜  罗宾
- Robin, I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry, Robin.

250
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,940
-我居然不知情  -太糟糕了
- I had no idea. - That's terrible.

251
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,730
给我们上点烤鸡肉  快
Can we get some fried chicken over here, stat!

252
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,960
我真是不够朋友
I am such a bad friend!

253
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,870
三个放荡的修女出现在圣彼得
Three slutty nuns show up at St. Peter's--

254
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,070
慢着  她们不放荡
Wait, wait, they're not slutty.

255
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,100
她们的确很放荡  不过不应该一开始就告诉你
Well, they are, but you're not supposed to know that yet.

256
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,990
亲爱的  什么事
Hey, baby, what's up?

257
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,350
听着  搭建
Hey, uh, listen, the construction of

258
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,350
"光之交响乐"的进度
the Symphony of Illumination is taking

259
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,910
比我想象中慢
a little longer than I thought.

260
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,630
幸好我有斯科特帮忙
Good thing I have Scott here to help me.

261
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,510
对吧  斯科特
Right, Scott?

262
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,110
当然啦  埃先生
You betcha, Mr. E!

263
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:22,990
坏消息
Bad news.

264
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,590
罗宾因为身高过高  当不了国奥撑杆跳选手
Robin's too tall to be an Olympic pole-vaulter.

265
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,320
她向国际奥林匹克委员会提出申诉了吗
Has she filed an appeal with the IOC?

266
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,010
你向国际奥林匹克委员会提出申诉了吗
Have you filed an appeal with the IOC?

267
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,880
她能弯腰曲背让自己矮点吗
Can she make herself shorter by slouching?

268
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,380
你能弯腰曲背让自己矮点吗
Can you make yourself shorter by slouching?

269
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,480
她考虑过回学校
Has she considered going back to school

270
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,810
参加大学级别的比赛吗
and competing at the collegiate level?

271
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,460
你考虑过回学校参加...
Have you considered going back to school and...

272
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,280
我现在不想讨论这个
I don't want to talk about it.

273
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,370
对不起
Sorry.

274
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,970
我爱你  宝贝  明儿见
I love you, baby. See you tomorrow.

275
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,280
好的  我也爱你
Okay, I love you, too.

276
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,460
斯科特
Scott?

277
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,810
斯科特  我的手机掉下去了
Scott, I dropped my phone.

278
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,950
找到了
Yep, found it.

279
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,290
你能拿上来吗
Could you bring it up here?

280
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,350
没问题
You got it.

281
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,490
用我顺便帮你拿罐啤酒上去吗
Hey, while I'm at it, can I get you a beer?

282
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,500
他想给老头子拿罐啤酒
He wants to bring the old man a beer.

283
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,600
行  当然好啦
Yeah, sure.

284
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,520
冰箱里有一整箱
Uh, there's a whole case in the fridge.

285
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,760
谢谢你  孩子
Thanks, son.

286
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,550
你不介意我叫你"孩子"吧
Do you, do you mind if I call you "Son"?

287
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,290
你喜欢叫我什么都行
You can call me whatever you want...

288
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,720
混蛋
jackass.

289
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,220
斯科特Scott?

290
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,760
梯子倒了
The ladder fell.

291
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,990
斯科特
Scott?

292
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,470
马修年轻时常吃的大麻三明治

293
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,500
斯科特
Scott!

294
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,510
听我说
Listen, um,

295
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,090
我知道在这段时间里
I know things have been kind of weird

296
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,980
你和我的关系变得很奇怪
between you and me these past couple weeks,

297
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,240
我只想说
so I just want to say I'm...

298
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,790
我很开心我们又回到了原点
I'm glad we're back to where we started.

299
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,760
-对  -重新成为炮友
- Yeah. - Friends with benefits.

300
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,970
-不  -就像往常那样
- No. - Just like always.

301
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,190
从来不是炮友  只是朋友
Never been that. Just friends.

302
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,510
可以打炮的朋友  这事以后再议
With benefits. We'll talk about it later.

303
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,710
瞧瞧这屋子宝宝
Look at all these babies.

304
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,090
世界真奇妙  一旦知道你没有怀孕
Isn't it crazy how, now that we're not having one,

305
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,010
宝宝又变得可爱无比了
babies are cute again?

306
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,250
看那一个
Look at that one.

307
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,950
我不看了
I'm good.

308
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,460
不  我说真的  快看
No, I'm serious. Look, look.

309
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,570
我靠
Damn it.

310
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,710
这玩意儿太他妈可爱了
That thing's cute as crap.

311
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,910
天杀的  小可爱
Screw you, baby.

312
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,460
斯科特
Scott?

313
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,810
斯科特
Scott!

314
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,290
这是怎么回事
What is going on?

315
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,350
-埃先生  -斯科特
- Hey, Mr. E. - Scott...

316
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,960
如果你不让我下来
if you do not let me down,

317
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,340
我就扯开嗓子叫到有人来帮忙
I am going to scream my head off until someone comes to help me,

318
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,810
到时候你可就要向警察解释这一切咯
and then you're going to have to explain all of this to the cops.

319
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,650
那你就必须解释
And then you'll have to explain why there's

320
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,850
为什么你的手机里有我的鸡鸡照
a picture of my ding-dong on your phone.

321
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,780
我手机里没有...
There is no picture of your...

322
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,410
现在有了
There is now.

323
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,550
哇  拍得太美了
Oh, yeah, that's a beauty.

324
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,720
斯科特
Scott?

325
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,930
斯科特
Scott!

326
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,570
斯科特
Scott!

327
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,080
马修一直
Marshall keeps

328
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,540
让我发咪咪的照片给他
asking me to text him pictures of my boobies.

329
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,480
都老夫老妻这么多年了
After all these years,

330
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,000
他还会时不时像个孩子一样闹我
he sometimes still acts like a teenager.

331
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,500
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

332
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,460
疯子杜安
Insane Duane.

333
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,990
现在是常人杜安了
It's Sane Duane now.

334
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,420
你以前可是个伟人呀
You used to be magnificent.

335
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,770
你没事吧
Are you okay?

336
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,550
没事  没事  我想
Yeah, yeah, um, I guess this, um,

337
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,310
撑杆跳这件事真的打击到我了
this pole-vaulting thing is finally hitting me.

338
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,610
我不明白  罗宾
I don't get it, Robin.

339
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,940
你真想成为一个撑杆跳选手吗
Did you really want to be a pole-vaulter?

340
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,130
不不  我其实
No, no, I was, uh,

341
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,550
一直坚决抵制...
I was always adamantly against having a...

342
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,280
成为撑杆跳选手
uh, a pole-vaulting career,

343
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,850
即使这是很多女人梦寐以求的事
even though it's what most women want.

344
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,770
撑杆跳是很多女人梦寐以求的吗
Most women want to be a pole-vaulter?

345
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,300
在加拿大是  人们非常喜欢这项运动
In Canada-- it's very big up there.

346
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,990
生活就是  遇见对的人
You know, it's, it's meet a nice guy,

347
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,580
结婚  偶尔撑两杆
get married, vault some poles,

348
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,150
但我...
but I...

349
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,080
从来不想要那种生活
never wanted that.

350
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,800
当然  不想要是一回事
Of course, it's one thing not to want something.

351
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,810
不能要又是另外一回事了
It's another to be told you can't have it.

352
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,350
我真心觉得  只要回心转意
I guess it's, it's just nice knowing

353
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,590
还有能力做这件事  该多好呀
that you could someday do it if you changed your mind.

354
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,130
而现在  通往那种生活的大门  突然间就关上了
But now, all of a sudden, that door is closed.

355
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,480
那个一边滑雪一边射击的运动呢
What about the one where you ski and shoot at the same time?

356
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,560
你挺擅长那个的
That seems like something you'd be good at.

357
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,920
天啊  罗宾  看这个
Oh, my God, Robin, look at this.

358
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,650
加拿大小可爱
O Cana-dorable!

359
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,050
对不对
Am I right?

360
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,380
失陪一下
Excuse me.

361
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,330
这玩意真的有效
Yep, this works.

362
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,410
斯科特  等我下来
Scott, when I get down from here,

363
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,210
你麻烦就大了  老兄
you are going to be in big, big trouble, mister.

364
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,680
别这样  埃先生
Come on, Mr. E.

365
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,080
你小时候就没放纵过吗
Didn't you ever cut loose when you were a kid?

366
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,920
不要转移话题
That's irrelevant.

367
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,960
我当然放纵过
I mean, of course I did.

368
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,150
有一次  我父母出城去了
One time, when my parents were out of town,

369
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:58,110
我和几个哥哥办了一场业余摔跤表演
my brothers and I set the basement on fire

370
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,730
结果把地下室烧着了
hosting an amateur wrestling exhibition.

371
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,780
因为我们还搞了些舞台效果
There were some theatrics.

372
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,840
看  你能理解我吧
See, you get me.

373
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,350
你和其他被我困在屋顶的傻瓜不一样
I don't think of you as some dummy I trapped on the roof.

374
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,330
我更愿意把你看成  我的爸爸
I think of you more like, like my dad.

375
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,980
能让我们的派对再开半小时吗  求你了
Can we keep the party going for 30 more minutes, please?

376
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,940
好吧  斯科特
Okay, Scott.

377
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,960
谢了  老爹
Thanks, Pop.

378
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,910
没事  孩子也是需要发泄一下精力的
It's fine, kid just needed to blow off some steam.

379
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,540
不
No!

380
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,900
那是冈德森祖母亲手织的
Grandma Gunderson knitted that!

381
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,300
斯科特
Scott...!

382
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,470
太可怕了
That was crazy.

383
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,690
她就这样哭着跑了出去
She just ran out of there crying.

384
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,950
她也不接电话
Now she's not answering her phone.

385
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,010
自从我们那晚回忆了飓风之夜后
She's been acting really weird for a few weeks now,

386
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,300
她最近几周表现都很反常
really since the night we discussed the hurricane.

387
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,800
巴尼  你和她拼车回家
Barney, you split a cab home.

388
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,300
她有跟你说什么吗
Did she say anything?

389
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,420
我俩其实没怎么说话
We didn't really talk much.

390
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,430
幸好
Well, lucky for us,

391
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,390
这里的某人颇为擅长
someone at this table is skilled

392
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,240
侦查推理之术
in the art of detection.

393
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,280
罗宾很难过
Robin's upset.

394
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,560
她和凯文之间出了问题
She and Kevin are having trouble.

395
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,330
-他出轨了  -不可能
- He cheated on her. - No way.

396
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,960
凯文是个诚实正派的人
Kevin's an honest, decent guy

397
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
况且就算他状态最好的那天
who never on his best day

398
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,060
也泡不到比罗宾好的妞了
could pull a hotter chick than Robin.

399
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,590
那也许是罗宾出轨了
Maybe Robin cheated on him.

400
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,600
也许是罗宾这枝红杏  伸出了墙外
Maybe Robin is the dirty bird who slept with someone else.

401
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,830
我觉得撑杆跳这件事
I don't know, this pole-vaulting thing seems

402
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,450
才是那个让她崩溃的点
like a slam dunk to me.

403
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,810
太明显了
Oh, it is so obvious.

404
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,200
巴尼
Barney.

405
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,140
你那个同事
What is the name of that guy

406
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,780
叫什么来着  兰迪
you worked with-- uh, Randy?

407
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,860
就是那个兰迪
It was Randy.

408
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,900
等等
Wait a second.

409
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,420
我刚刚破解了事情的真相
I just cracked this case.

410
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,940
那件枫叶婴儿装
The little maple leaf onesie.

411
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,290
让罗宾想家了
It made her homesick.

412
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,400
所以她才如此难过
That's why she's so upset.

413
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,750
她不回家过圣诞节
She's not going home for Christmas.

414
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,100
她想让我邀请她去俄亥俄过节
She wants me to invite her to Ohio.

415
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,030
肯定就是这样了
That's got to be it!

416
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,140
要不然就是她和巴尼睡了
Either that or she slept with Barney.

417
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,780
你一定是斯科特吧
Oh, you must be Scott.

418
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,910
太太  你好
Oh, hello, ma'am.

419
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,730
总算见到"庐峰"真面目了
It's nice to finally see your face.

420
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,290
我得回家温书去了
Well, I'd better go hit those books.

421
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,500
少年  请留步
Hold it right there, young man.

422
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,110
这是你帮助我先生的奖励
This is for helping out my husband.

423
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,220
五十大洋
Wow, 50 bucks.

424
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,120
祝你圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

425
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,890
莉莉
Lily!

426
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,370
一张去克利夫兰的机票
An airplane ticket to Cleveland?

427
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,560
虽然不是你家  但好歹都是家
I know it's not Canada, but it starts with a "C"

428
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,870
而且也冷得蛋疼  所以快去准备行李吧
and it's cold as balls, so get packed.

429
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,010
你跟我一起回家过圣诞节
You're coming home with me for Christmas.

430
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,540
想法不错  老兄
Yeah, nice try, dude.

431
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,390
就算六年能挣一亿二千五百万
I wouldn't go to Cleveland for $125 million

432
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,220
我也不去克利夫兰
paid over six years.

433
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,220
勒布朗・詹姆斯曾为克利夫兰骑士队效力了六年
薪水总额为一亿二千五百万

434
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,120
又是这个
Still?

435
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,880
勒布朗的玩笑你要开到什么时候
Still with the LeBron jokes?

436
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,070
勒布朗后来为总冠军加盟迈阿密热火
于10-11总决赛败给小牛队与冠军失之交臂

437
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,070
冠军戒指在哪里
Where's that ring, huh?

438
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,180
他本该得到的总冠军戒指在哪里
Where's that ring he's supposed to have by now?

439
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,890
我还以为你是因为不能回家
Look, I just-- I thought you were bummed

440
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,240
过圣诞节而沮丧呢
about not going home for Christmas.

441
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,520
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

442
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800
我喜欢圣诞时节的纽约
I love New York at Christmas.

443
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,330
宁静而平和
It's so quiet and peaceful.

444
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,870
还有蛋酒与我为伴
Got my eggnog to keep me company, so...

445
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,050
罗宾  到底怎么回事
Robin, what's wrong?

446
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,100
-没事啊  -告诉我吧
- Nothing. - Just tell me.

447
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,460
你干嘛这么想知道
Why do you need to know so bad?

448
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,680
然后我才能帮你打气呀
So I can cheer you up.

449
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,630
为我打气又不是你的职责
It's not your job to cheer me up.

450
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,630
是的  没错
Yes, it is.

451
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,440
为你打气就是我职责所在
Cheering you up is my job.

452
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,080
好  你被开除了
Well, then, you're fired.

453
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,020
你不能开除我
You can't fire me.

454
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,440
我可有工会撑腰  贱人
I'm union, bitch.

455
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,830
为我打气不是你的责任
