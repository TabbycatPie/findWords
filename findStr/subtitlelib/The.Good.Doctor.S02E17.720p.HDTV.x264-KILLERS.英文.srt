20
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,340
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

21
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,500
Dr. Murphy, you shouldn't be in contact with patients.

22
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,580
Or their families. Do you understand?

23
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,610
Don't be stupid.

24
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,150
What? There's no cameras in here.

25
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,930
Dr. Lim, Dr. Melendez.

26
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,820
I do not want to be a pathologist.

27
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,200
Dr. Han, you need to make me a surgical resident again.

28
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,820
What are you doing up so early?

29
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,970
I'm not up early.

30
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,430
I never went to bed.

31
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,290
Oh, my God. Didn't you get my text?

32
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,060
I told you I was spending the night with Jake.

33
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,990
I don't want to be a pathologist.

34
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,050
It's...that still.

35
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,260
Shaun...

36
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,130
no one's life goes exactly like they dreamed as a kid.

37
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,360
You're still a doctor. Still saving lives.

38
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,250
Just in a lab instead of an operating room.

39
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,070
Where are you going?

40
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,550
I'm going to walk to work.

41
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,520
The hospital's four miles away.

42
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,270
Studies have shown that walking boosts creative inspiration.

43
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,790
- Shaun, I just think -- - You don't understand.

44
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,920
You don't understand.

45
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,160
Neither does Dr. Han.

46
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,200
I need to change his mind.

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,550
I don't know how.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,150
We're gonna be late.

49
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,210
So stop.

50
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,770
And don't be smiling at me when you see me in the hall.

51
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,890
I smile at everyone. I'm a friendly guy.

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,540
You'd be a horrible poker player.

53
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,840
- What're you doing? - Murphy's on the corner.

54
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,660
Move it.

55
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,390
That's not where his bus drops off.

56
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,590
Do you think he saw us?

57
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,150
He's not looking over here.

58
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,960
Well, that doesn't mean anything with him.

59
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,270
We got to get out of here before the light turns.

60
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,890
Let's go! Move it!

61
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,210
Through the generous support of St. Bonaventure Foundation,

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,760
we've been able to transport Kenny and his mother

63
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,280
from their home in Mississippi.

64
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,790
And we'll be covering the costs of surgery and post-op recovery

65
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,410
And all I have to do is buy one CD a month

66
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,740
for the next 100 years.

67
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,390
No repayment necessary.

68
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,280
We appreciate you allowing us to share your case

69
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,720
as an educational opportunity for our staff.

70
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,000
You know what they say -- those who can't, teach.

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,750
And as you can see, I can't do much of anything.

72
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,720
Actually, y'all haven't really seen anything yet.

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,940
How about we get this party started?

74
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,680
The neurofibroma started as a small bump

75
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,150
near the base of the spine.

76
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,010
In less than six months,

77
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,130
it encircled his abdomen and grew to over 100 pounds,

78
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,270
the blood supply becoming so intertwined with the patient's,

79
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,930
it was deemed inoperable.

80
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,450
But we've been able to come up with an innovative surgical plan

81
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,650
that will allow us to slowly peel the tumor

82
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,830
off the front and back of his torso in one piece

83
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,780
and give Kenny his life back.

84
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,760
We didn't expect to see you.

85
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,400
This is just about logistics, witness lists, scheduling.

86
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,380
The hospital's attorney

87
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,270
could've handled this on his own, Dr. Han.

88
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,910
I understand, but I wanted to be here.

89
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,600
Three reasons really.

90
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,570
If my doctors are gonna be judged in this room,

91
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,010
I wanted to see the place,

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,050
see all of you, and see the mood --

93
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,040
Well, we try to make it very casual.

94
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,460
I know.

95
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,820
But have you ever been judged?

96
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,170
I have.

97
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,810
It's scary.

98
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,440
Someone has gone to the trouble

99
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,860
of checking out every aspect of your actions,

100
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,440
every decision you've made.

101
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,210
You don't know what they know, what they're gonna ask,

102
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,910
what could be misunderstood, misinterpreted.

103
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,930
Also, and this is kind of embarrassing,

104
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,120
but our lawyer...

105
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,630
probably not the best.

106
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,370
I decided to save a few dollars on him.

107
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,300
So I could hire a private investigator --

108
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,200
check all of you out.

109
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,120
We're not the ones on trial here.

110
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,010
See?

111
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,170
You say you make it casual, and then you call it a trial.

112
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,360
Now, I'm sure she won't find anything.

113
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,140
I mean, nothing too crazy, right?

114
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,440
Maybe just something... embarrassing.

115
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,860
Maybe a lapse of judgment here or there.

116
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,490
I mean, like I was saying,

117
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,980
you parse every choice anyone has made,

118
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,620
gonna be a few things they'd rather not revisit.

119
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,590
Am I right?

120
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,730
And the third reason?

121
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,390
I thought maybe you'd want to work out a compromise.

122
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,220
The surgery went well.

123
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,260
We were able to fully evacuate

124
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,860
the subdural hematoma without any complications.

125
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,700
It's a good thing you didn't hesitate to bring her in.

126
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,560
One advantage of being an insecure, first-time mom

127
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,100
who panics every time her child has a slight fever.

128
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,650
Did I just hear you admit that you're insecure?

129
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,070
The girl who double-majored in Physics and Chemistry

130
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,230
because the Dean told her they were the two toughest?

131
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,490
Mom guilt ruins us all. You'll see.

132
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,100
Whenever you decide to give up the motorcycle and settle down.

133
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,010
No way.

134
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,570
My kid's going to kindergarten on the back of a Ducati.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,880
I'm sorry. I need to go check on another patient.

136
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,630
Oh, how long will she need to stay here?

137
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,700
I'm still not sure what caused the bleeding.

138
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,740
I didn't see any signs of an aneurysm or AVM, so that's good.

139
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,680
I'll have a better idea when I get the post-op test results

140
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,140
back from Pathology.

141
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,390
Thank you.

142
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,620
This is why I love Pathology.

143
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,400
We don't just fix stuff.

144
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,790
We figure out how it got broken and why.

145
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,890
Good morning.

146
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,360
Just checking to make sure you got my clot specimen and blood draws. 

147
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,470
Just logged them in.

148
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,710
Great. And if there's any way to expedite, I'd appreciate it.

149
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,110
The mom's a friend of mine and stressed to the max.

150
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,510
- I'm pretty sure the bleed was caused -- - Stop.

151
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,710
I'm sorry. I meant...please stop.

152
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,250
I'd rather not know what you think.

153
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,070
It causes confirmation bias.

154
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:37,930
Copy that.

155
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,880
Did I see you on Hanover Street this morning?

156
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,850
I...don't know.

157
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,270
Were you on Hanover Street this morning?

158
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,290
Yes.

159
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,760
I walked to work.

160
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,680
Did you... see anything interesting...

161
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,350
on the walk?

162
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,010
S-Shaun?

163
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,060
We can't both expedite your results

164
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,340
and reminisce about our morning walks.

165
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,100
Sorry. Carry on.

166
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,480
You're totally freaking out, aren't you?

167
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,610
No, I'm not freaking out.

168
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,060
All my patients freak out

169
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,630
waiting for their final test results.

170
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,380
For 48 hours, you don't know if you've won the lottery

171
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,720
or...if you're gonna be dead in a few months.

172
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,550
Hell, I freak out, too.

173
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,200
It's the only time I feel helpless.

174
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,150
The treatment's over.

175
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,140
There's nothing left to do but...wait.

176
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,930
I'm a little stressed.

177
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,350
That speech -- not helpful.

178
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,890
My advice. Embrace it.

179
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,710
You're experiencing emotions

180
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,360
only a few people on Earth will ever understand.

181
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,370
The kind Hemingway wrote about.

182
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,790
- I'm more of a Faulkner guy. - You would be.

183
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,230
- You don't like Faulkner? - No, I don't like Faulkner.

184
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,000
Nobody really likes Faulkner.

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,170
I like Faulkner.

186
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,340
Right.

187
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,940
Anyway...

188
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,050
if there's anything you need from me,

189
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,510
even if it's just to talk,

190
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,340
you have my direct number.

191
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,490
Do not hesitate to use it.

192
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,810
I appreciate that.

193
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,830
And I would like to show my gratitude.

194
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,550
I know I haven't been the easiest patient to deal with.

195
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,880
That's not necessary.

196
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,220
I mean, if you want,

197
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,010
you can make a donation to cancer research.

198
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,860
I already donate.

199
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,330
I wanted to thank you, not society at large.

200
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,380
How about -- have you ever tried Macallan's Sherry Oak 25?

201
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,460
I don't drink.

202
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,120
And I just said it's not necessary.

203
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,590
How about a weekend in Ojai? I hear the spa is amazing.

204
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,170
- No means no. - I'm not trying to molest you.

205
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,520
I just want to thank you.

206
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,670
And you have, and you are very welcome.

207
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,780
Why do you have to control every little thing?

208
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,240
I have pepper spray in my purse. Don't make me use it.

209
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,920
Carly, I am gonna need 60 units

210
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,030
of type B-positive packed red blood cells held for O.R.

211
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,090
60? 

212
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,350
You operating on a hemophiliac elephant?

213
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,190
Our patient has a 200-pound neurofibroma.

214
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,080
Cool.

216
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,040
There's more blood in the tumor than the patient,

217
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,760
{\an1}so we're gonna have to follow Massive Transfusion Protocol.

220
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,160
You...

222
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,760
You might need antifibrinolytic agents to control the bleeding.

223
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,410
That's a good idea. Thanks.

224
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,330
I could do some research on cell salvage techniques.

225
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,860
Cancer is a risk, but if we were --

226
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,260
I'm sorry, Shaun.

227
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,420
Melendez has put together a pretty big team, so...

228
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,170
we have everything we need.

229
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,040
I talked to Murphy. He definitely saw us.

230
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,170
What'd he say?

231
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,720
It's not what he said. It's how he acted.

232
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,660
He was clearly uncomfortable talking to me.

233
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,070
He's uncomfortable talking to everyone.

234
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,040
We need to get out in front of this.

235
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,790
Tell Andrews before someone else does.

236
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,090
We need to figure out exactly what Murphy saw.

237
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,420
How? We can't just ask him

238
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,540
if he saw us making...

239
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,180
bread.

240
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,700
We're not gonna get anywhere with indirect questions.

241
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,900
I'll talk to him.

242
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,100
You think you can read him better than I can?

243
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,700
No, but if at first you don't succeed...

244
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,170
Let the man try?

245
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,520
Dr. Han wants to see you two.

246
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,970
- Both of us? - Yep.

247
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,250
Yep.

248
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,730
Have a seat.

249
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,500
Actually, we've been meaning to talk to you.

250
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,780
- The issue is... - Dr. Han met with the Medical Board.

251
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,590
We're not going to be suspended or reprimanded.

252
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,040
The hospital will pay fines on your behalf,

253
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,930
and you'll need to complete

254
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,910
a few continuing education classes.

255
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,760
But overall, not bad.

256
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,640
Thank you.

257
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,450
Yeah, thanks.

258
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,080
Does this mean I'm back on the surgical team?

259
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,610
No. It does not.

260
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,700
You convinced the Board that he's competent.

261
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,650
You're welcome.

262
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,070
We got a big problem. With our tiny patient.

263
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,640
I did a repeat assessment of the pre-op CT's

264
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,380
and found a trace subarachnoid bleed.

265
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,900
But there was no bruise on her scalp.

266
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,950
I know.

267
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,680
The only way she could get this injury

268
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,310
is if someone shook her,

269
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,220
and they would have to shake her hard.

270
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,890
S-someone abused her.

271
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,660
No.

272
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,730
I've known Laura since high school.

273
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,900
She's the most composed,

274
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,600
even-tempered person I've ever met.

275
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,630
And she's totally devoted to that baby.

276
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,700
What about the father?

277
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,140
She conceived via a donor.

278
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,840
A nanny, a relative,

279
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,970
a-a boyfriend who's been helping out?

280
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,510
She waited so long for this --

281
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,360
wanted to do everything herself.

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,400
Then it has to be her.

283
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,200
We need to call Child Protective Services.

284
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,870
No.

285
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,640
Not yet.

286
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,190
I'm gonna do an MRI

287
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,950
to rule out benign enlargement of the extra-axial space.

288
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,320
Before we ruin her life...

289
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,060
Good idea.

290
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,900
Except for the part about you doing the test.

291
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,880
She's your friend.

292
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,350
You think I'd try to help someone cover up child abuse?

293
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,120
I don't know you well enough

294
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,330
to know what you would or wouldn't do

295
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,630
to protect a friend.

296
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,210
I could do the MRI.

297
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,800
I'm not the mother's friend.

298
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,880
But you are a pathologist.

299
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,840
Giving MRI's is not your job.

300
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,480
Page Farmer. Have him do it.

301
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,480
On it.

306
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,570
{\an1}Murphy.

307
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,240
We need to talk.

308
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,300
I don't have a girlfriend.

309
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,230
Okay.

310
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,010
Is that consistent with what you've deduced and seen

311
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,180
regarding my life?

312
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,590
Yesss?

313
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:46,840
Good.

314
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,710
Enjoy your apple.

315
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,300
It's not fair.

316
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,830
Shaun is being punished for mistakes

317
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,120
that Han thinks he might make in the future.

318
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,860
He's not punishing him.

319
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,340
He just saved his ass.

320
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,820
Okay, Kenny.  The MRA's gonna help us map

321
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,240
the blood supply to the tumor.

322
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,540
If you could just lie still.

323
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,910
No talking until we're done.

324
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,480
Sure, no problem.

325
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,880
We should take a stand.

326
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,440
Meaning what? Stage a walkout?

327
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,360
How much does one of these bad boys cost, anyway?

328
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,770
About $3 million.

329
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,130
But it's worthless unless you stop talking.

330
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,330
Sorry. My bad.

331
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,540
Us getting fired is not gonna do anything to help Shaun.

332
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,570
And I'm not even sure we should be helping him.

333
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,430
Did you ever stop to think

334
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,320
that maybe Han knows what he's doing?

335
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,420
Shaun has made mistakes,

336
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,930
but he has three more years of residency.

337
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,070
That is plenty of time to improve.

338
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,950
Yes, you can build a winning team

339
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,540
through supportive training,

340
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,560
but you can also do it by recruiting the best

341
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,520
and pushing them. Relentlessly.

342
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,560
No feelings. No charity. No loyalty.

343
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,300
Those who thrive and get better

344
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,760
than they ever thought they could, you keep...

345
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,200
...and those who don't, you cut.

347
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,150
That's not good. 

348
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,420
It works for Jeff Bezos and Bill Belichick.

349
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,050
I'm not talking about your leadership lecture.

350
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,370
I'm talking about this.

351
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,710
We need to page Melendez.

352
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,110
What are you talking about? You know me!

353
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,710
How could you possibly believe I could hurt my baby?

354
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,970
I don't. Which is why I ordered the additional tests.

355
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,610
But did you never leave her with anyone else?

356
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,590
Even for just a few minutes so that you could take a nap?

357
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,780
Or a bath?

358
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,640
Taking care of a newborn. It's -- it's exhausting.

359
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,770
No. It isn't.

360
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,540
After waiting for so long,

361
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,150
every single moment, no matter how hard...

362
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,100
It's not exhausting.

363
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,290
It's a joy.

364
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,680
Laura, I know you love her...

365
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,510
but you're still human.

366
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,130
You must get tired sometimes.

367
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,620
I don't! Really.

368
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,820
You don't understand because you --

369
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,900
because you haven't experienced it.

370
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,430
But when you love someone so much...

371
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,930
The tests.

372
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,130
They have to be wrong.

373
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,510
We expected the tumor to grow since the last scans,

374
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,150
but not to this extent.

375
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,580
Blood vessels that I thought we'd be able to quickly cauterize

376
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,260
are now thicker than my thumb.

377
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,540
It's impossible to remove the tumor

378
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,390
without causing you to bleed to death.

379
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,320
No.

380
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,370
I don't care how risky it is.

381
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,070
I'd rather die in surgery than continue to live

382
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,300
with this huge, damn tick sucking the life out of me.

383
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,140
Kenny, as long as your heart remains healthy,

384
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,360
you basically will be, too.

385
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,440
And we can do a better job treating the pain.

386
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,750
I don't want to be treated.

387
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,420
I want to be cured.

388
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,530
I want my life back.

389
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,070
I always thought all...

390
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,190
all I had to do was get enough money,

391
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,910
or find the right doctors...

392
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,240
But if you're telling me there's no hope...

393
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,030
I appreciate everything y'all done.

394
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,070
Or at least tried to do.

395
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,650
The injuries from shaking a baby are much different

396
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,280
than from blunt force trauma.

397
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,310
Oh, that's awful... but also interesting.

398
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,630
It's like you're a detective in a murder mystery.

399
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,820
Only, thank God, the baby's not dead.

400
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,880
That's exactly what Carly said.

401
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,610
She likes solving medical mysteries.

402
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,960
She's very smart. And aggressive.

403
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,500
Well, how do she treat you? Is she nice?

404
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,080
Yes, she's very nice.

405
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,210
She wants me to stay in her department.

406
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,210
She thinks we make a good team.

407
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,410
So it sounds like you have a case you're interested in

408
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,080
and a coworker you like who's nice to you.

409
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,440
Maybe Pathology won't be that bad after all.

410
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,980
I have work to do.

411
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,640
Since it seems we're gonna be working together

412
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,020
for a while longer...

413
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,780
maybe it is time we came out of the closet.

414
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,340
Maybe?

415
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,010
Are you saying you want to?

416
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,510
Do you want to?

417
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,590
Maybe.

418
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,250
You're afraid it would make things awkward?

419
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,780
People seeing us as a couple?

420
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,310
Yes, obviously.

421
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,660
But at the moment, I'm more afraid

422
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,470
that we wouldn't be having this conversation

423
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,260
if Murphy hadn't almost busted us.

424
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,850
Which makes me think we're not ready to have this conversation.

425
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,290
It's understandable if we aren't.

426
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,100
We've both been in relationships we thought were gonna last...

427
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,900
Yeah. Understandable, but why should we even care

428
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,260
what people at work think?

429
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,680
So, should we talk to Andrews?

430
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,380
Maybe. What do you think?

431
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,260
Maybe.

432
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,290
Uh, Sawchuck?

433
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,510
Sorry for the wait. Oh. Thank you.

434
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,740
Excuse me, duck curry and rice?

435
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,130
40 minutes? Really?

436
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,970
Sorry, the kitchen fell a bit behind.

437
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,520
- It shouldn't be much longer. - You're not just behind.

438
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,860
People have come in after me,

439
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,550
they've gotten their food, gone home, eaten.

440
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,240
They're in their PJs, watching a movie.

441
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,620
I'm so sorry. I'll check right now.

442
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,720
Duck curry.

443
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,100
Here you go, sir. Duck curry, brown rice.

444
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,520
White rice.

445
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,790
- Excuse me. Duck curry with brown rice? - Yes.

446
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,160
- Connelly? - That's me. Thank you.

447
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,750
What are you guys doing back there?

448
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm so sorry, Sir.

449
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,630
You know what? I'm tired of sorry.

450
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,960
I just -- I want my food!

451
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,710
I'm sorry. It should just be another minute.

452
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,950
I don't want to wait any longer!

453
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,410
I'm sorry.

454
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,100
Sorry. I'm sorry.

455
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,390
I didn't -- I didn't mean to yell.

456
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm so sorry.

457
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,210
Carry on. Carry on. Enjoy your...

458
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,630
She's always trying to one-up us.

459
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,070
Morgan.

460
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,280
She's not staying late because she wants to do research.

461
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,820
She's staying late so that Han can see she's staying late.

462
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,390
It's just who she is. Don't take it personal.

463
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,160
My dad's a Taekwondo grandmaster.

464
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,370
Coached me growing up.

465
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,130
He always used to say, "Only you can beat you."

466
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,000
Well, my mom's a lounge singer, and she used to say,

467
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,550
"Upstage me and I'll beat your ass."

468
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,880
You'd think if you're selling boba,

469
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,220
you'd have straws wide enough

470
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,880
to get the balls through the damn thing.

471
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,220
I can't believe you drink that stuff.

472
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,580
It's like putting gummy bears in a drink.

473
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,960
You give up?

474
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,460
Want a soda instead?

475
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,340
I see you.

476
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,510
Which is, I assume, your primary objective.

477
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,220
I didn't even know you were still here.

478
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,410
I've been reading the latest journal articles

479
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,440
- on neurofibroma. - Go home.

480
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,400
There's nothing you can do for Kenny Grimm.

481
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,440
And you're gonna have other patients tomorrow.

482
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,360
I got an idea.

483
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,050
If we embolize the larger blood vessels to the tumor

484
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,010
before surgery,

485
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,140
we can use your body's clotting factor to help clog them.

486
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,140
This should reduce hemorrhaging during surgery

487
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,580
and allow us to excise the tumor without you bleeding out.

488
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,850
We'll steer a catheter through an artery in your thigh --

489
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,440
- Yes. - Kenny...

490
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,470
maybe you should let them finish.

491
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,680
No, I shouldn't.

492
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,690
And, yes, you should.

493
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,760
Yes, yes, yes. As soon as possible. Yes.

494
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,390
Thank you.

495
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,710
The tests came back.

496
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,420
They confirm the previous results.

497
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,450
Well, they're wrong. There must be some other --

498
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,210
There has to be another test! Please.

499
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,800
Ma'am, you're gonna need to come with us.

500
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,720
- You need help. - From you!

501
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,260
You're my friend, and you called the police?!

502
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,310
Well, someone hurt your baby. If it wasn't you --

503
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,520
No one hurt my baby! You're wrong!

504
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,380
How can you not believe me?!

505
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,440
Just need to get a few more branches off the aorta

506
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,510
and we're done.

507
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,270
Well done, Dr. Browne.

508
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,410
What's the fluid status?

509
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,250
CVP is 14 and rising.

510
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,500
Get diuretics on deck. 40 milligrams I.V. Lasix.

511
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,290
Careful. If his pressure goes too low,

512
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,710
his kidneys won't perfuse.

513
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,050
I need you to keep his CVP between 8 and 12.

514
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,720
He can't tolerate much more of this.

515
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,130
We need to get him to an O.R.

516
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,640
Embolizing his vessels caused third spacing of fluids

517
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,250
to the body and lungs.

518
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,430
We saved the operation,

519
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,500
but now we only have half the time do it.

520
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,380
Any word?

521
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
No, not yet.

522
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,070
Well, i-isn't there someone from Radiology

523
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,490
who can expedite, someone who owes you a favor?

524
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,160
Even if there was, I would not waste it on you

525
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,390
because you do not need it.

526
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,290
You are one of the most willful patients I've ever had,

527
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,500
and the finish line is in sight.

528
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,110
All you need to do is just run through the tape.

529
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,330
Look, if it helps, as soon as I'm done with this patient,

530
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,430
we can talk some more.

531
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,260
I can write you a script

532
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,720
for something to help you with the anxiety,

533
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,460
but I don't think you need it.

534
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,670
You got this.

535
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,020
- More suction. - Me, too.

536
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,220
More sponges.

537
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,640
Retract.

538
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,100
That's it.

539
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,400
What's his estimated blood loss?

540
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,230
About 8 1/2 liters.

541
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,830
The entire human body

542
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,200
typically only has 5 1/2 liters of blood.

543
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,700
Yeah, I know.

544
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,740
Let's get 30 more units on deck of PRBC.

545
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,120
Add cryo, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets to that.

548
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,070
We should have checked for blood breakdown products.

549
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,740
If you don't mind, I'm trying to pay attention to this.

550
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,410
I wasn't talking to you.

551
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,270
Or about this patient.

552
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,170
We need to reexamine the subdural blood clot specimens.

553
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,920
If there's hemosiderin deposition and chronic membranes

554
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,300
including fibrous wall,

555
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,820
it could prove it was not abuse.

556
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,260
What else could it be?

557
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,330
The tests proved non-accidental trauma.

558
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,580
Yes. The tests were right.

559
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,880
Resected portion is secure.

560
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,730
I.V.'s and central line?

561
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,060
- Secure. - Secure.

562
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,690
Okay, everybody, get in position.

563
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,340
Let's flip this pancake.

564
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,900
On three.

565
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,350
One, two, three.

566
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,410
Wait. His heart rate spiked.

567
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,480
Lay him back down.

568
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,900
Softly. Softly.

569
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,400
We okay?

570
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,570
Yeah. Just a blip.

571
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,840
Once more with feeling.

572
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,820
Ready? One, two, three.

573
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,970
- How are we doing? - Good. He's stable.

574
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,810
All right, swab the posterior incision site.

575
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,920
Okay, scalpel and sponge on a stick.

576
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,140
He's crashing.

577
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,230
He's ventilating fine.

578
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,110
We've got no immediate blood loss or hemorrhaging.

579
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,440
It looks like distributive shock.

580
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,260
I need stat labs and initiate shock resuscitation.

581
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,450
He's got a high white count and what looks to be

582
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,700
a systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine release.

583
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,030
Cutting off the blood supply to the tumor

584
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,580
is causing post embolization syndrome.

585
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,950
I need intra-arterial lidocaine,

586
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,790
130 milligrams of methylprednisolone,

587
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,870
and start antibiotics.

588
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,540
Should we be trying to reverse the embolization?

589
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,880
Restore blood flow to the tumor?

590
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,340
Well, then, we'd risk him bleeding out even faster.

591
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,130
We need to abort.

592
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,300
Cut off what we already excised and leave the rest.

593
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,260
- No. We can't give up. - We're not giving up.

594
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,620
We're stopping a futile procedure to save the patient.

595
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,310
We need to get Murphy in here. It's a blood flow problem.

596
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,060
Murphy has a special talent for visualizing complex anatomy.

597
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,020
We don't have time. We need to stop the P.E.S. now.

598
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,480
- Page Dr. Murphy. - No. Do not page Dr. Murphy.

599
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,360
I get it. You like him.

600
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,690
But we don't have time for an audition.

601
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,110
I'm trying to save my patient's life.

602
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,860
My patient. Which means it's my call.

603
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,740
I am also trying to save your patient's life,

604
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,700
so I'm urging you to stop wasting time.

605
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,990
Now we've cut away almost half.

606
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,080
That's all we can do right now.

607
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,540
So let's remove it and give him a chance

608
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,270
to live and fight another day.

609
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,750
The breakdown products show

610
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,380
the injury that caused the hematoma

611
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,700
happened at least seven weeks ago.

612
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,490
When was she born?

613
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,240
A little over seven weeks ago.

614
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,180
But the vacuum delivery must've caused a subdural bleed

615
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,750
which re-bled two days ago.

616
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,420
The baby wasn't abused.

617
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,630
Shaun, we need you in the O.R.

618
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,480
Any thoughts, Dr. Murphy?

619
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,780
You don't have enough time.

620
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,630
You can't fully map the circulatory system

621
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,680
and remove the tumor without killing the patient.

622
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,120
It's too complex.

623
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,540
Well, at least he was brief and to the point.

624
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,890
Now, can we do what I --

625
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,000
But you don't have to do it quickly.

626
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,400
We slow down, he bleeds out.

627
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,770
If you clamp the aorta,

628
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,820
it could lower the blood flow to the tumor enough

629
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,950
to slow the release of the cytokines.

630
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,990
Clamping the aorta

631
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,410
will kill the intestines, kidneys, and legs.

632
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,450
Not if we release the clamp every 10 minutes.

633
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,540
Give it just enough blood to stop the cytokines

634
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,650
but not so much that he bleeds to death.

635
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,200
Let's do it.

636
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,410
Thank you for the consult, Dr. Murphy.

637
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,640
Reposition him to lateral.

638
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,460
Secure I.V. and central line.

639
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,380
Secure.

640
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,630
Ten blade.

641
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,130
Starting midline laparotomy.

642
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,930
Debakey.

643
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,300
Opening up the lesser sac.

644
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,640
Vessel loops.

645
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,980
Get a Rumel ready.

646
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,270
I need umbilical tape.

647
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:28,010
MRI exams show chronic changes of surgery and radiation,

648
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:32,250
but no sign of residual tumor detected.

649
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,000
No signs.

650
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,880
None.

651
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,260
Zero. Zippo. Zilch.

652
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,200
We'll do another MRI in six months just to be sure,

653
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,390
but you are in the clear.

654
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,150
This is exactly what we hoped for.

655
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,580
Kinehora.

656
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,570
Knock on wood.

657
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,310
- Thank you. - Oh, you son of a bitch.

658
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,380
I told you.

659
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,710
You told me no.

660
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,430
It's too heavy for diamonds.

661
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,360
Is it a Magic 8 Ball?

662
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,850
Will you just open it?

663
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,020
I don't like baseball.

664
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,980
I do.

665
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,150
So you got me something you like?

666
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,530
I caught that foul ball down the third base line...

667
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,620
on my 13th birthday.

668
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,750
My dad was amazed that I snagged it.

669
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,890
After the game, we went outside the stadium.

670
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,890
And I was a shy kid, but my father pushed me

671
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,260
to ask my favorite players to sign it, and they all did.

672
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,680
Bert Campaneris, Rollie Fingers,

673
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,260
Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter.

675
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,850
If it happened today, it'd all be on video.

676
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,230
But all I have to remember that awesome day...

677
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,270
is that ball.

678
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,400
I wanted you to have something that mattered to me.

679
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,580
- Aaron, I can't. - Oh, yes, you can.

680
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,010
Bye.

681
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,050
Cancer changes people.

682
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,310
I've had patients tell me it was a blessing.

683
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,020
That their lives were better after.

684
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,640
They're idiots.

685
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,650
Maybe.

686
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,110
Would you have thought of such a wonderful gift 11 months ago?

687
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,600
Care to do the honors?

688
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,190
Let's take it up.

689
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,410
I'm so sorry.

690
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,990
I should've trusted you.

691
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,210
Please talk to me, Laura.

692
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,540
Yell at me if you want. I deserve it.

693
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,960
- It's not your fault. - Yes, it is.

694
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,730
I should have done more research,

695
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,220
looked harder for an alternative diagnosis.

696
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,600
I mean it's not your fault you are the way you are.

697
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:01,020
You don't understand the love a mother feels.

698
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,330
I understand that a lot of mothers abuse their children.

699
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,480
You don't understand love.

700
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,610
Because you've never allowed yourself to be vulnerable.

701
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,660
Even when you were married to Kashal,

702
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,750
you never really committed.

703
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,380
You always expect the worst in people.

704
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,880
Because that's all you see in yourself.

705
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,180
Okay.

706
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,690
I've never been in so much pain...

707
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,110
but felt so good.

708
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,190
We'll up your pain meds.

709
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,130
You're still gonna need some skin and soft tissue grafts,

710
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,990
but the hard part's done.

711
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,030
Your prognosis is excellent.

712
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,870
Thank y'all so much.

713
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,260
What am I taking this thing home in?

714
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,080
A glass bottle? Y'all got something that big?

715
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,380
He's just being a smart ass.

716
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,670
Are you sure you want to do this?

717
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,930
Shut up.

719
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,240
I saved the patient.

720
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,870
I deserve to be a surgeon.

721
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,680
Dr. Murphy --

722
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,830
Dr. Han, I want my old job back.

723
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,650
You're making a mistake.

724
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,810
Am I, Shaun?

725
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,840
Yes.

726
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,470
Because it seems like you're doing really well in Pathology.

727
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,650
You made a great save on an earlier case

728
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,350
and a great save today.

729
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,350
You keep doing well, and, over time,

730
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,650
we can build to you having more responsibility.

731
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:17,950
No.

732
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,330
I'm a surgeon.

733
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:34,090
I am not leaving your office until you reinstate me.

734
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,640
What are you doing, Shaun?

735
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,530
Do you think ordering me to do something

736
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,870
will change my mind?

737
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,810
Do you really think it's a good idea to try and bully me?

738
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:53,570
I am a surgeon.

739
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,130
I am a surgeon.

740
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,990
Do you realize that you're proving my point?

741
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,170
That you're acting immature?

742
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,640
Showing that you don't know how to communicate

743
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,510
and you can't control your emotions?

744
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,970
I am a surgeon!

745
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,420
But you do have a talent that I value.

746
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,560
So I'm gonna give you one last chance

747
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,130
to maintain your dignity

748
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,590
and leave my office...now.

749
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,160
Because if I have to call Security,

750
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,180
you understand that I'm also gonna have to fire you.
