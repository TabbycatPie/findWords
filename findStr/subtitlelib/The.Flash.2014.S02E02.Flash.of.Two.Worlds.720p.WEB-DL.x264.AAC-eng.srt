- When you created the
singularity above central city,

You also created a breach

is your concern?

37
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,417

142
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,437
This is our earth.

143
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,341
Let's call it earth-1.

144
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:47,346
And this second earth,
let's call it earth-2.

145
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:50,215
This is where jay
claims to be from.

146
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:54,453
And these other earths,
three, four, five,

147
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:58,724
To infinity, all of them,
are nearly identical to ours.

148
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,693
And they all exist
at the same time,

149
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,996
Giving us endless alternatives
to what we have here.

150
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:09,301
For example, the joe west
on earth-2, your doppelganger,

151
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,669
He might not be
a detective.

152
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,338
He could be
a nobel prize-winning physicist.

153
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,875
And you, the barry allen here
is the flash,

154
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,345
But over there,
he could be an electrician.

155
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:25,150
- So, I'm assuming that the
people on all these other earths

156
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,652
Work to make money
to pay bills and such.

157
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,521
- I would imagine.
- So we got that in common.

a solution.
